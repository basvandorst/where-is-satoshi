 Money and power is what this story is based on with animals who are
very diverse and the same. Animal Farm is based on animals who want to
become independent, so they start a rebellion which was put together by
Old Major who is a prize winning boar whose vision of a socialist utopia
serves as the inspiration for the rebellion. Three days after describing
the vision and teaching the animals the song Beast Of England, Major
dies leaving Snowball and Napoleon to fight for control. Later on
Napoleon the pig who emerges as the leader of Animal Farm after Old
Major dies. Napoleon uses military force (his nine loyal attack dogs),
to intimidate other animals and consolidate his power. Snowball the pig
who challenged Napoleon for control of Animal Farm which he had lost,
Snowball is an Intelligent, Passionate, and Eloquent pig. But Snowball
seemed to win the loyalty of the other animals and cement his powers,
but that all changed when Napoleon sent his attack dogs after Snowball
and drove him out of Animal Farm. There is only one animal on the farm
who would not whine about the work he has to do for Napoleon his name is
Boxer the great cart-horse whose incredible strength, dedication, and
loyalty play a key role in the early prosperity of Animal Farm and later
the completion of the windmill. Boxer shows much devotion to Animal
Farms ideals but little ability to think about them independently. He
counted on the pigs to make his decisions for him. His two mottoes are 
I will work harder  and  Napoleon is always right . One of the
commandments were All animals are equal  but that later changed in the
story because some animals were more privileged than others some animals
had to work twice as hard as others and Napoleon got to sit back and
demand animals to do work while he made profit off of them by taking
many eggs from hens and selling them or selling cows milk. If I recall
Old Major saying that they will not sell their goods to people. Napoleon
was becoming one of the farmers himself by taking the milk and drinking
it himself, but the other animals obeyed the pigs hoping for a better
future but as of now their future is not insight. Animal farm is a book

  1878 Military Law Gets New Attention
  By T.A. BADGER, Associated Press Writer
  SAN ANTONIO (AP) - America's military is largely prohibited from
acting as a domestic police
  force, but with the increased fears of terrorism, some experts say
it's time to rethink those restrictions.
  ``Our way of life has forever changed,'' wrote Sen. John Warner (news
- bio - voting record), R-Va.,
  in a letter last month to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. ``Should
this law now be changed to
  enable our active-duty military to more fully join other domestic
assets in this war against terrorism?''
  The law, known as the Posse Comitatus Act, was championed by Southern
lawmakers in 1878 who
  were angry about the widespread use of the Army in post-Civil War law
  It currently bans the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from
participating in arrests, searches,
  seizure of evidence and other police-type activity on U.S. soil. The
Coast Guard and National Guard
  troops under the control of state governors are excluded from the act.
  Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, testifying in October before
the Senate Armed Services
  Committee (news - web sites), agreed that it might be desirable to
give federal troops more of a role
  in domestic policing to prevent terrorism.
  ``In certain cases we can do more than anyone else in the country
because of the special capabilities
  that we have,'' he said.
  Those roles could be varied, such as helping local law enforcement in
the event of a terrorist attack,
  patrolling the nation's borders or serving as armed sky marshals
aboard flights over the United States.
  But the issue of expanding the military's domestic reach sharply
divides lawyers who have spent years
  studying Posse Comitatus, Latin for ``power of the county.''
  Dennis Corrigan, a retired colonel who taught the law at the Army's
Judge Advocate General's
  school, says legislators should resist the urge to change it.
  The military isn't trained to be a police force, he says, so it should
stick to the skills for which it is
  trained: surveillance, information gathering, logistical support. All
of these activities are allowable under
  Posse Comitatus.
  ``There should be a partnership between the military and civilian
sectors - the civilian doing the
  confrontation and the military providing support,'' said Corrigan, now
a businessman living in Gilford,
  N.H. ``I'm not sure, even with what's going on today, that Congress
wants the military arresting
  people.''
  Jeffrey Addicott, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army JAG Corps,
wrote that the law handcuffs the
  nation when it comes to responding to terrorist attacks.
  ``We've got a homeland defense office, but if there's not reforms, the
Posse Comitatus Act will cut
  them off at the knees,'' Addicott, now a law professor at St. Mary's
University in San Antonio, said in
  a recent interview.
  ``This is a new kind of war,'' Addicott said. ``We have to make a
compromise now to prevent these
  guys from committing an act of terror on a larger scale.''
  Army Secretary Thomas White said late last month that the Pentagon
(news - web sites)'s review of
  Posse Comitatus would not likely lead to recommendations that Congress
overhaul the act.
  ``But we are looking at the details of the law to see if revisions are
appropriate in the way it's
  executed or the exceptions that can be taken,'' White said.
  Exceptions over the years have seen armed federal troops used for drug
interdiction and patrol of the
  U.S.-Mexico border to enforce immigration laws with mixed results.
  In 1997, a Marine corporal on a drug surveillance patrol shot and
killed an 18-year-old goat herder in
  the Texas desert about 200 miles southeast of El Paso. A Marine
inquiry determined its personnel
  were not adequately trained for the mission. Soon afterward, such
patrols ended.
  Michael Spak, a former Army JAG colonel now teaching at Chicago-Kent
College of Law, says the
  exceptions made in the name of national security in recent decades
have left Posse Comitatus a hollow
  shell. He says the law should be scrapped entirely.
  Any amendment to loosen Posse Comitatus would be strictly pro forma,
he says, because as it's now
  construed, the statute has enough wiggle room for the government to
use the military for domestic
  action as it sees fit.
  ``It's good for the law to tell the truth and for everybody to follow
the law,'' he said. ``But is it
  necessary? No.''

                 By Karen GulloAssociated Press Writer
                         Published: Dec 7, 2001
WASHINGTON (AP) - Attorney General John Ashcroft said trying Taliban
members in open U.S. court could create "Osama TV." He defended military
tribunals for terrorists and suggested that anyone who criticized them
was aiding the enemy.
Our legal powers are targeted at terrorists," he told the committee. "To
those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my
message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists, for they erode our
national unity and diminish our resolve."
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday that criticism can
hurt the anti-terrorism fight if it
undermines anti-terrorism legislation pushed by the administration.
"The attorney general's implication is clear. If you do not march in
lock step with the government, you are supporting the terrorists," the
Center for National Security Studies said in a statement.

U.S. Seeks Force-Feeding Order for Fasting Detainee in Phoenix

                                                            suspected
                                                            skyjackers.
                    He also trained at the same Phoenix area flight
school as an Algerian
                    pilot suspected of helping prepare some of the
hijackers, according to
                    federal investigative records.
                    But the only charges filed to date against Seif are
for identity fraud. A
                    federal judge recently stressed in a court order
that no evidence has
                    been presented linking him to terrorism.
                    Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is housing
Seif for federal
                    authorities, says he is getting worried about his
high-profile inmate. "I
                    don't want this guy to die in my jail," said the
no-frills lawman who
                    made headlines by housing prisoners in desert tents
and making them
                    wear pink shirts. Arpaio says he has been talking
with Seif, trying to
                    coax him to eat.
                    As a compromise, Arpaio said, he removed pork from
Seif's meals.
                    But he has declined to fill his special requests for
dates and ice water.
                    "I said, 'We don't have room service.' "
Seif's attorney, Thomas Hoidal, reported to a judge Monday that his
                    client was in the jail infirmary and too weak to
attend a hearing.
                    Seif, who left the U.S. before the attacks, has
complained that federal
                    investigators duped him into returning to answer
questions. After he
                    landed in Phoenix on Oct. 25, he was arrested for
allegedly making
                    false statements on federal forms to obtain dual
                    "He doesn't understand, when he came back
voluntarily, why he is
                    being treated in this fashion," said Hoidal, who
also is trying to
                    persuade Seif to eat.
                    Prosecutors expect to file additional bank and
financial fraud charges
                    against Seif and are worried he may be unfit to
stand trial. They are
                    seeking medical and psychiatric evaluations of Seif.
                    One veteran U.S. law enforcement official in Phoenix
said he knew of
                    no other instance when federal prosecutors there
sought a
                    forced-feeding order.
                    Sporadic hunger strikes have been reported among the
more than
                    1,000 detainees rounded up in the anti-terrorism
crackdown. But Seif,
                    who has dropped from about 180 to about 150 pounds,
appears to
                    have lasted the longest.
                    It is not clear whether Seif intends to fight the
forced feeding order, his
                    attorney said. A hearing is scheduled for today.
Arpaio doubts a
                    judge's order will be effective, as long as Seif
remains conscious. "If
                    he's still coherent . . . you can't force the guy to
eat if he says he
                    doesn't want to."
                    In another development Wednesday, a coalition of 16
civil liberties
                    groups filed suit against the Justice Department,
demanding information
                    about those arrested and detained since the Sept. 11
attacks. The groups said they were seeking
                    such information as the names of the detainees, the

I suppose this is what you get for working for the state, eh?
MIDDLETOWN, N.J. -- On Saturday, the Middletown High School
South Tigers won the state football championship. On Monday, their
head coach went to jail.
Coach Steve Antonucci was among 135 striking schoolteachers and
secretaries behind bars by day's end Wednesday, and the number is
expected to swell as nearly 900 continue to defy a judge's order to get
off the picket line and into the classroom.
                                                            The five-day

                    are being led to jail sobbing or defiantly
denouncing the local school
                    board and residents. "This town ought to be ashamed
of itself," said
                    Lauren Spatz, a second-grade teacher. "The parents
don't care about education. . . . It's not going
                    to be the same ever again. The teachers' morale is
going to be shot."
                    But parents and administrators say the teachers'
timing couldn't be worse, with layoffs at nearby
                    computer firms and families still shaken by the
death of more than 30 local residents in the World
                    Trade Center attacks.
                    And there is no end in sight.
                    "It's become a war," said plain-spoken,
chain-smoking school Supt. Jack DeTalvo, shortly before
                    getting on the phone to give instructions to the
board's attorney about how to garner the best
                    coverage on local evening news shows.
                    One thing all sides agree on: If and when the
contentious job action ends, the bitterness could leach
                    into the classroom.
                    The strike has left 10,500 students out of school in
this sprawling suburb of 70,000 an hour and a
                    half south of New York City. With record-breaking
warm weather, the days off are a treat for the
                    children but a hardship for working parents, who
range from truck drivers to Wall Street
                    investment brokers.
                    In addition, state law dictates that all missed
school days are made up at the end of the year.
                    Teachers counter that a few days of inconvenience is
minor compared to being hauled off in
                    handcuffs.
                    "I'm a soccer mom, I drive a van and I have a dog,"
science teacher Katie Connelly said with a
                    rueful laugh as she sat waiting to go to jail. "But
this is our revolution. . . . The only way you get
                    respect is if you stand up for yourself."
                    Dispute Over Who Pays Health Benefits
                    At the heart of the dispute is a demand by the
school board that the union members pay a
                    percentage of rising health benefits instead of a
flat annual fee of $250. The strikers angrily respond
                    that they will end up having to pay up to $600 extra
for benefits, which would effectively cancel
                    out wage increases. The teachers have been offered
pay raises of 3.8%, 4% and 4.2% over three
                    years.
                    The teachers went on strike for a short time three
years ago. They said the board at that time had
                    ignored the recommendations of a fact-finder and
instead imposed a contract on them that, by law,
                    they said they had to accept. This time, the union
is calling for binding arbitration, which the school
                    board has refused, insisting that the teachers
return to class first.

Pope Says Internet 'Wonderful' but Needs Regulating
  By Crispian Balmer
  VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Internet caters to the best and worst of
human nature and needs
  regulation to stop depravity flooding cyberspace, Pope John Paul (news
- web sites) said Tuesday.
  The 81-year old Pontiff, who last year sent his first message over the
Internet, praised it as a
  ``wonderful instrument'' that should be used to spread the word of God
and encourage global peace.
  However, he warned that while it offered access to immense knowledge,
the Internet did not
  necessarily provide wisdom and could easily be perverted to demean
human dignity.
  ``Despite its enormous potential for good, some of the degrading and
damaging ways the Internet can
  be used are already obvious to all,'' the Pope said in a message
prepared for World Communications
  Day.
  ``Public authorities surely have a responsibility to guarantee that
this marvelous instrument serves the
  common good and does not become a source of harm,'' he added.
  Although the Pope does not have an e-mail address, the Vatican (news -
web sites) has an active
  Web site ( and the Church is reportedly searching for a
patron saint of Internet users.
  The question of regulation has inflamed passions since the Internet
sprang to prominence in the 1990s,
  with enthusiasts arguing that cyberspace should not be pegged back
behind national boundaries or
  rules.
  The Pope warned that not only did the Internet allow the spread of
depraved material, it could also
  lead people to believe that facts mattered more than values.
  ``The Internet offers extensive knowledge, but it does not teach
values and when values are
  disregarded, our very humanity is demeaned,'' he said, adding that the
system focused people's
  attention on an ``almost unending flood of information.''
  ``Yet human beings have a vital need for time and inner quiet to
ponder and examine life and its
  mysteries,'' he said. ''Understanding and wisdom are the fruit of a
contemplative eye upon the world,
  and do not come from a mere accumulation of facts, no matter how
  He said the Catholic Church had adapted to every discovery through the
ages, from the Renaissance
  to the invention of printing and the Industrial Revolution, and must
now learn to reach the masses via
  cyberspace.
  ``Like the new frontiers of other times, this one too is full of the
interplay of danger and promise,'' he
  said.
  ``For the Church the new world of cyberspace is a summons to the great
adventure of using its
  potential to proclaim the Gospel message.''
  In his first message sent to the world directly over the Internet last
November, Pope John Paul
  apologized to victims of sexual abuse by priests and other clergy.

Report: Russian Police Detain Bank
  Hacker
  MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian police have detained a computer
  hacker accused of extorting $10,000 from a U.S. bank after breaking
  into its data base and threatening to publish accounts details, ORT
  television reported on Wednesday.
  ORT said the alleged hacker was a 21-year-old college dropout from
  the Siberian oil town of Surgut, but did not identify either him or
  ``well known'' bank. The Moscow police computer fraud unit had been
  brought into the case, it said, at the request of the U.S. Federal
  of Investigation.
  ``He sent a letter to the bank executives in which he issued what
  amounted to an ultimatum: If they didn't send him the money the
  information would be published,'' Alexander Slutsky, head of the
  computer fraud unit, told ORT.
  He said the hacker had posted on a secondary Internet site details of
  some of the 1,500 accounts he had accessed, in order to prove to the
  bank that his intentions were serious.
  The television said the U.S. bank had paid the ransom and showed
  what it said was footage of the hacker being detained and the home
  computer he had used for the operation. It did not say when the arrest
  had occurred.
  Alexander Zhuravlyov, a senior detective, told ORT that investigation
  showed that the suspect had learned his skills from a Moscow-based
  Web site where hackers swapped information.
  ORT said the suspect was likely to face charges of extortion rather
  than computer fraud.
  Cases of fraud have multiplied in recent years in Russia and the
  has also earned a reputation for developing talented computer
  specialists.

  Eve after escaping prosecution under U.S. copyright law in connection

Cyber Cafe Crackdown Looms
                       Business: The Garden Grove City Council meets
Tuesday to consider
                     restrictions on the proliferating computer sites
after gang-related crimes.
                     By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER
                     With Internet cafes springing up faster than any
                     other business in its city, the Garden Grove City
                     Council is expected Tuesday to impose a
                     moratorium on permits for new cafes and place
                     tighter controls on those already open.
                     The new ordinance, if passed, would reduce
                     hours, require surveillance cameras and restrict
                     the number of computers to cut back on
                     crowding.
                     The city's crackdown stems from a series of
                     criminal incidents, mostly in parking areas
                     surrounding the cafes. The most serious was Dec.
                     30, when a 20-year-old was stabbed to death
                     outside the PC Cafe on Garden Grove
                     Boulevard. A 21-year-old suspected gang
                     member has been charged with murder.
                     "After the stabbing incident, it dawned on us that
                     we really haven't taken a hard look at these
                     places," said Garden Grove Mayor Bruce
                     Broadwater.
                     Johnny Oh, owner of the PC Cafe, said he can easily
comply with most of
                     the proposed ordinances. He installed security
cameras and hired a security
                     guard after the stabbing.

NEW YORK  A German United Nations employee who admitted scratching
anti-Semitic graffiti on a Jewish neighbor's door and setting it afire
was indicted Thursday on arson and other charges as hate crimes.
BERLIN -- German Interior Minister Otto Schily, an energetic campaigner
against U.S.-based neo-Nazi websites, has asked U.S. Attorney General
John Ashcroft for help in his fight.
Specifically, Schily asked Ashcroft during one of their recent
face-to-face meetings to exert pressure on an American Internet service
provider to block a site with an official-sounding German name that
currently diverts traffic to a neo-Nazi site.
As of Wednesday, anyone clicking on  will

Interior Ministry, but at a site run by Gerhard Lauck of Nebraska,
dubbed by some the "Farmbelt Fuehrer" because of his enthusiasm for

 said Dirk Inger, Schily's spokesman.
"They said a lot of things. First they said they had to check it, then
they said they would do it. Then they said they would check it again.
But nothing happened."
So, said Inger, Schily asked Ashcroft for his help when the two men met
twice last month, once in Washington and once in Berlin, to discuss the
war on terrorism.
"It was constructive," said Inger. "It's difficult, of course, because
of your legislation and the First Amendment of the Constitution."
The German Interior Ministry has also contacted the German Embassy in
Washington and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, asking both to lobby the ISP
directly. It also approached the United Nations Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Service.

Concealed-Weapon Law Stirs Debate in Alaska
                                    ANCHORAGE, Alaska   Judge
                                    Natalie Finn took away Timothy
                                    Wagner's gun permit after he claimed
                                    someone had implanted a computer
                                    in his head and injected him with
                                    chemicals.
                 A state appeals court, though, ruled that Finn erred,
saying Alaska's
                 concealed-carry law does not allow general concerns
about mental
                 illness to play a role in deciding whether someone
should have a gun.
                 Gun control advocates say the episode illustrates a
                 accommodation to the gun lobby by Alaska's Legislature.
                 owners, however, argue that Alaska's law safeguards
their Second
                 Amendment rights and that the public is adequately
                 The Department of Public Safety has issued more than
18,000 such
                 permits since 1995, when Alaskans were allowed to carry
                 handguns under restrictions that include an age limit
and a gun-safety
                 course.
                 In 1998, the law was amended so that applicants did not
have to
                 prove they actually needed to carry a concealed weapon.
                 whether someone was mentally ill or had been treated
for mental
                 illness in the preceding five years was taken off the
list of questions
                 applicants were asked  a change cited by the appeals
court last
                 year in Wagner's case.
                 The Alaska law requires applicants to disclose only
whether they have
                 ever been committed to a mental hospital or found
                 incompetent by a court. "Yes" answers are grounds for
denying a
                 permit.
                 "We wanted to remove the potential for arbitrary and
                 decision making on the part of the issuing agency,"
said Brian Judy,
                 Alaska liaison for the National Rifle Association.
                 But Nancy Hwa, spokeswoman for the Brady Campaign to
                 Gun Violence, complained: "They are taking away the
discretion of
                 local law enforcement to make these decisions in the
best interest of
                 public safety."
                 Other gun-friendly states, including Texas, Montana and
                 Carolina, have much stricter standards when it comes to
                 instability and concealed-carry permits, said Luis
Tolley, the Brady
                 Campaign's state legislative director.
                 In Montana, the law says a sheriff can deny a permit if
there is
                 reasonable cause to believe "the applicant is mentally
ill, mentally
                 defective or mentally disabled."
                 North Carolina applicants with a "physical or mental
infirmity that
                 prevent the safe handling of a handgun" can be denied a
                 Even Texas has a long, broad list under mental health,
Tolley said.
                 The restrictions include anyone that has been diagnosed
with "a
                 psychiatric disorder or condition" that is likely to
cause impairment in
                 judgment, mood, perception or intellectual ability.
                 "Alaska seems more likely than many states to allow
mentally ill
                 people to carry guns in public," Tolley said. "By
establishing such a
                 narrow definition, that is allowing an awful lot of
people who are
                 mentally ill to carry guns in public."
                 Wagner's case began in 1998, when he entered the Alaska
                 and Diving store in Anchorage, dripping wet, and told a
clerk he was
                 trying to soak away chemicals in his body before they
killed him. He
                 also said a computer chip had been implanted in his
head. Another
                 employee overheard the conversation and called police.
                 A background check revealed he had a permit to carry a
                 gun. When an officer asked Wagner if he had a gun with
him, Wagner
                 pointed to a briefcase next to him. In it was a loaded
.357 and several
                 bags of bullets.
                 Alaska law requires permit holders who come in contact
with police
                 to tell officers immediately if they are carrying a
concealed gun.
                 Wagner was convicted of failing to do so.
                 Finn sentenced Wagner to three years' probation and
ordered him not
                 to possess guns during that period. She also ordered
him to forfeit his
                 concealed-gun permit until his mental illness was
"either cured or
                 improved."
                 The Department of Public Safety later revoked Wagner's
                 based on Finn's decision.
                 Efforts to reach Wagner were unsuccessful. He has no
                 listing in Anchorage. He told the court he was an
"inventor" and
                 designed guns and ammunition. The public defender's
office said it
                 had not recently heard from him.
                 Wagner had no prior convictions, according to court
                 After his arrest, police took him to a state mental
hospital. Wagner
                 testified that he was released after being interviewed.
                 The amended law was enacted over the veto of Gov. Tony
                 who warned at the time that the measure could allow
                 people to carry concealed weapons.
                 The Department of Public Safety has taken a
wait-and-see attitude in
                 Wagner's case. He has not again asked for his permit
back and no
                 court has ordered it returned, said Del Smith, deputy
                 "I think Finn was concerned about his behavior, and
rightly so," Smith
                 said. "He made some pretty bizarre claims."

 Olympics Officials Keep Eyes on Protesters
 By Geraldine Sealey ABCNEWS.com
 Security plan for terrorists  and protesters.
                     Security for the Salt Lake City Olympics, with a
price tag exceeding $300
                     million, was a top priority even before Sept. 11.
But international terrorism
                     isn't the only threat: Officials are bracing for a
potential record number of
                     protesters and that some might take advantage of
the world stage to make
                     mayhem.
                     While Olympics and city officials say they have no
evidence of unruly
                     demonstrations planned for the 17-day Games set to
begin on Feb. 8, they
                     are preparing for them. About 1 million visitors
from around the world are
                     expected to descend on the city next month along
with an undetermined
                     number of demonstrators.
                     One official strategy for controlling
demonstrations seems to be
                     accommodating peaceful protesters as much as
possible. So many
                     demonstrators want to come to Salt Lake City to
support their causes that
                     officials are providing demonstrators seven
official protest zones 
                     believed to be a first for the Games. The city is
also issuing official permits
                     for groups that want to protest in Salt Lake City
during the games.
 By providing safe zones where demonstrators can exercise their free
speech rights, city and Olympic
 officials are hoping to prevent the kind of violent and disorderly
protests that have marred such recent
 international events as the 1999 World Trade Organization (news - web
sites) meetings in Seattle or
 last year's G8 summit in Genoa, Italy.
 Mapping out protest zones and certifying legitimate Olympic
demonstrators is helping the Games
 organizers keep tabs on who is showing up, officials say. The
organizers clearly have learned lessons
 from recent violent demonstrations. They're also tuned in to radical
environmental and animal rights
 activists, active in Utah, who have turned to violence in recent years
to spread their message.
 "The demonstrations that have gotten out of hand like at the WTO seem
to be a fairly recent
 phenomenon that we want to be prepared for," said Josh Ewing, a
spokesman for Salt Lake City.
 Not All Protesters Created Equal
 In the new era of globally organized protesters and violence-prone
anarchists, not all protesters are
 created equal. The protest groups who have signed up for permits to set
up camp near the Olympic
 events are peaceful groups and are not expected to incite unrest.
 "[Games planners] are preparing for the worst, but animal rights have
the intention of organizing
 non-violent protests," said Sean Diener, director of the Utah Animal
Rights Coalition, which is helping
 to organize protests against the Olympics-sponsored Rodeo. "We have no
expectation for anything to
 turn out like the things in Genoa or Seattle. There will be non-violent
but effective protests," he said.
 As of late last week, 10 groups had received official protest permits
from the city, including homeless
 activists, supporters of the banned Chinese spiritual sect Falun Gong
(news - web sites), disabled
 rights advocates, and a church group critical of gay rights.
 Even though Olympics protests so far are expected to be peaceful,
security officials are concerned
 that demonstrators interested in violence or general lawlessness could
infiltrate those protesters who
 are coordinating their efforts with the city and Olympic officials.
 Officials have investigated the Web site of a group called Build
Underground Resistance Not the
 Olympics, which claims to be devoted to agitating and educating
demonstrators for the Games. The
 site reads: "BURN the Olympics has been initiated by radicals who are
not resigned to sit back and
 watch our city turn into a playground for the rich. We plan on using
our diverse skills and tactics to
 tackle the multinational death machine that is killing the planet."
 BURN says the Olympics are too corporate, too money-driven, advance
globalization and
 nationalism, and ruin the environment. Another group, Citizens Activist
Network, is also opposed to
 the Olympics on similar grounds, but has signed up for a legal permit
to protest in an official zone,
 where BURN has not. A spokeswoman for BURN, who only goes by the name
of "Sabrina," said her
 group would not apply for a permit because by doing so, "we would be
recognizing the authority of
 the state to grant or deny freedom of speech."
 Intelligence Operation Against Anarchist Infiltration
 Further, she said, many globalization protesters would likely
demonstrate at a meeting of G8 finance
 ministers scheduled for Feb. 8 and 9 in Ottawa, and so turnout among
globalization protesters is not
 likely to be comparable at the Olympics as at other international
 It is difficult to tell how many demonstrators the BURN group
legitimately represents. Salt Lake City
 officials believe the BURN site might only be run by the spokeswoman,
with no extensive organization
 backing it. But still, officials are preparing for anything.
 To head off violent protests, law enforcement agencies have conducted
years-long intelligence
 operations in an attempt to figure out whether potentially disruptive
groups are headed to Salt Lake
 City.
 The security effort also will include handing our educational pamphlets
to protesters with permits to
 warn them about the possibility that radical activists who would incite
violence could infiltrate their
 ranks.
 While officials are doing everything in their power to allow
demonstrators to have a voice during the
 Games, "People have been oblivious to other people infiltrating them
and it's gotten nasty," Ewing
 said.
 Olympics planners will warn demonstrators that if police ask them to
disperse for any reason and they
 do not, protesters will be arrested.
 Hoping for Crowd Control
 Stephen Clark, legal director of the Utah chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union (news - web
 sites), said he hopes security officials have learned how to control
crowds more efficiently after past
 clashes with demonstrators got ugly.
 "There seems to have been two models: Seattle, where there seemed to be
a total lack of preparation,
 and then the other extreme is the Republican convention in Philadelphia
in 2000," he said, "where
 police seemed to apply a program of preventive detention by rounding up
usual suspects and placing
 them in jail with million-dollar bails so people couldn't cause chaos
for the convention.
 "I hope the organizers have appropriately planned for spontaneous
protests, or even people who
 might want to cause mischief, and not overreact."
 The threat of violence at the Olympics is not a new phenomenon, of
course. At the 1996 Atlanta
 Games, the bombing in Centennial Park killed 1 and injured 111,
reminding Olympic organizers how
 vulnerable the Games could be.
 Terrorism also struck the Olympics in Munich in 1972 when 11 Israeli
athletes were killed by
 Palestinian gunmen.

Thursday 3 January 2002
ISLAMABAD (Wahdat): The deputy chief of Afghan intelligence,
Abdullah Tauhidi, has claimed that intelligence officials have
acquired a number of new videotapes of Osama bin Laden and
his associates in the al-Qaeda network.
The videotapes show clearer camera work, which could be far
better proof for a court of law to put the most wanted man on trial
in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks, he said in
an interview.
The videotapes pictured bin Laden and other members of his
network planning terrorist activities around the globe. Unlike
previous tapes obtained by the US, the new tapes are very clear
in picture and voice. This will help to clear up continuing doubts
about the authenticity of the videotapes that have earlier been
obtained and made public.
                                         He said that these tapes would
be put on public display after a
                                         thorough investigation by the
authorities concerned. We are

                 Robert Schlesinger, Boston Globe
Tuesday, January 8, 2002
                 Washington -- On Sept. 20, as much of the
                 country was still in shock from the attacks on the
                 Pentagon and the World Trade Center,
                 self-proclaimed members of the Animal Liberation
                 Front firebombed a primate research lab in New
                 Mexico, causing $1 million in damage.
                 In October, a federal land management facility in
                 California was torched, causing $85,000 in damage.
                 Members of the Earth Liberation Front claimed
                 responsibility. The same movement is suspected of
                 planting two homemade bombs in November at a
                 forestry research center at Michigan Tech
                 University.
                 As the Bush administration pursues its war on
                 terrorism at home and abroad, some political
                 leaders, particularly from Western states, want to
                 ensure that extreme environmental and animal rights
                 groups share the focus.
                 While even the harshest critics acknowledge that
                 there is no proportionate comparison between Al
                 Qaeda and groups like the Earth Liberation Front --
                 particularly because these radical environmental and
                 animal rights groups have avoided taking lives --
                 they say that terrorism is terrorism.
                 "The point has come when we need to strip away
                 the Robin Hood mystique from this terrorism in our
                 country," said Rep. Scott McInnis, a Republican
                 from Colorado.
                 McInnis's district includes the famed ski town of
                 Vail. Earth Liberation Front members burned down
                 a ski resort there in 1998, causing $12 million in
                 damage. An estimated $40 million in damage is
                 attributed to these radical groups over the past few
                 years. That figure includes the fires at the Coulston
                 Foundation labs in Alamogordo, N.M., in
                 September and the Bureau of Land Management
                 Wild Horse and Burro Facility in Litchfield (Lassen
                 County), in October.
                 State bomb squad technicians defused the two
                 bombs found outside forestry research buildings at
                 Michigan Tech last month. The Earth Liberation
                 Front has not claimed responsibility for planting the
                 explosives, but self-identified members of the group
                 sent threatening e-mails to the university.
                 FBI REPORT ON TERRORISM
                 The FBI, in its most recent report on terrorism in
                 the United States, identified such groups as among
                 the biggest and fastest-growing domestic threats.
                 "The threat posed by special interest extremism --
                 most notably the extreme fringes of the animal rights
                 and environmental movements -- is also emerging as
                 a significant concern for law enforcement," said the
                 report, issued last year.
                 Group members style themselves as defenders of
                 Earth or animals against rapacious corporations and
                 a complicit government. They ask who the
                 "extremists" really are.
                 "I find that torturing sentient animals, harming
                 animals who would otherwise live a free life in the
                 wild, I find that a bit extreme," said David
                 Barbarash, a spokesman for the Animal Liberation
                 Front, which opposes the often-painful use of
                 animals in medical or product testing. "I don't find
                 torture a normal practice; I think that's an extreme
                 practice."
                 CHARACTERIZATION REJECTED
                 Barbarash dismissed descriptions of his group and
                 the Earth Liberation Front as terrorist organizations,
                 saying that no one has ever been killed by their
                 actions.
                 But there are similarities to terrorist organizations.
                 ALF and ELF are organized in a cell structure, with
                 small groups acting independently and without a
                 central leader. The Internet is used as a tool to
                 spread information and exhortation. ALF's Web site
                 has a "recommended reading" section that includes
                 a document on "Setting Fires With Electrical Timers
                 -- An Earth Liberation Guide."
                 The decentralized set-up is designed to prevent
                 interference with the groups' activities.
                 "This decentralized structure helps keep activists out
                 of jail and free to continue conducting actions," the
                 ELF Web site says. Activists who damage property
                 are rarely identified or caught.
                 Representative Darlene Hooley, a Democrat from
                 Oregon whose district has endured a lot of clashes
                 over the environment, is sponsoring a bill that would
                 set up a national environmental terrorism information
                 clearinghouse and step up federal aid for areas of
                 high activity.
                 "There has been increased activity on ecoterrorism
                 in our state and in the Northwest and in my district,"
                 said Hooley, who added that Oregon has
                 experienced 100 "major acts of terrorism" in the
                 past 20 years -- one-third of them in the last four
                 years.
                 In February, McInnis will chair a hearing of a House
                 Resources subcommittee focusing on ecoterrorism,
                 and he has subpoenaed the former spokesman for
                 ELF.
                 McInnis and a half-dozen other Western
                 Republican legislators have also sent a letter to
                 prominent mainstream environmental groups calling
                 upon them to disavow groups like ELF and ALF.
                 McInnis, who is regularly at odds with these groups
                 on policy matters, likens his effort to the
                 coalition-building the United States has done
                 internationally against terrorism.
                 He hopes to form "coalitions with governments that
                 do not necessarily agree with the U.S. on policy but
                 agree that terrorism is not a way to solve policy
                 differences," McInnis said.
                 Most of the environmental groups -- who had
                 long-standing, vocal positions opposing the radical
                 fringe of their movements -- rolled their eyes at the
                 political posturing while reiterating their positions.
                 "I wonder why seven congressmen are so interested
                 in challenging an organization to disavow
                 ecoterrorism when Greenpeace has a perfect,
                 30-year record of peaceful, nonviolent civil
                 disobedience used to engage corrupt governments
                 and corporations around the world," John
                 Pasacantando, Greenpeace USA's Executive
                 Director, wrote to McInnis. "I wish that you would
                 drop this ruse of trying to link peaceful
                 environmental efforts to terrorism -- just at the
                 moment when the country needs you to actually
                 focus on real issues."

Norwegian Hacker Indicted for Breaking Hollywood DVD Code

OSLO, Norway (AP) - Prosecutors filed criminal charges Thursday against
a Norwegian teen-ager who drew Hollywood's anger by writing and

After a two-year investigation, authorities indicted Jon Lech Johansen

Johansen's defenders call the prosecution a wrongheaded attack on
intellectual freedom. Creating software that breaks copy-protection
schemes, they argue, is not the same as using such programs to steal
copyright material.
Johansen, who was 15 when he authored the software, has said he did so
because only wanted to be able to play movies on his computer.
"Software that Jon wrote is something that is necessary for people to be
able to exercise their...rights with a DVD," said Robin Gross of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has provided Johansen's legal
Johansen, now 18 and a household name as DVD-Jon in Norway, became a
celebrity among computer hackers, who even marched to support him in New
York, where a related civil trial was held.
Norway's economic crime police declined to charge Johansen under the
country's copyright laws. Rather, prosecutors are using a law that
prohibits data break-ins.
"We want to focus on the code-breaking part of it, and that he made a
copy of something that he did not pay for," said Inger Marie Sunde, an
attorney with the Norwegian police unit.
The investigation grew out of complaints filed by the Motion Picture
Association of America, which represents the major Hollywood studios.
Sunde said authorities agreed with the studios' contention that
Johansen's program unlocked their property and left it open for theft.
Sunde said it was the first such case in Norway. She did not know when
the trial would begin but said it would probably be sometime this year.
If convicted, Johansen could face up to two years in prison and claims
for compensation.
Gross, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the law in question
is designed to prevent break-ins of secured systems like banks. In this
case, she said, Johansen was trying to access his own property - a DVD
he lawfully purchased.
Johansen could not immediately be reached for comment. Repeated efforts
to call his home and mobile numbers produced busy signals.
Movie industry officials applauded the indictment and expressed
confidence that "Norwegian law will provide a fair and just result."
DVDs are gaining fast in popularity and rapidly becoming the preferred
media for movie sales. They hold up to seven times more data than CDs
and, because they are digital, don't lose quality when copied.
The movie industry had attempted to protect films recorded to DVDs with
the Content Scrambling System, usually called CSS. Johansen's DeCSS
program unlocks the discs, opening them for copying and playing.
Though Johansen has said he was trying to watch DVDs on a Linux-based
computer, which did not already have DVD software like Windows and
Macintosh systems, the program also permits reproduction of DVDs and
their circulation over the Internet.
Such free distribution could cost the movie industry millions of dollars
a year, it argues.
According to the indictment, more than 5,000 copies of the DeCSS program
were downloaded from the Internet in the first three months after it was
posted. It can still be found on the Internet.
The DeCSS program has been the subject of at least three lawsuits in the
United States.
In November, a federal appeals court in New York sided with Hollywood
and rejected free-speech claims from Eric Corley, who had posted links
to the program on his Web site. A similar case is pending in
A California appeals court, however, sided with a man who posted DeCSS
on his site. The DVD Copy Control Association, which licenses the DVD
scrambling system, considered the posting a breach of trade secrets and
is appealing to the state Supreme Court.

Anthrax suspect worked in U.S. lab
By Jerry Seper
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
The FBI's search for the person who mailed anthrax-laced
letters that killed five persons has focused on a former U.S.
scientist who worked at a government laboratory where he
learned how to make a weapons-grade strain of the deadly
Law enforcement authorities
and leading biochemical experts
familiar with the FBI's five-month
investigation said agents targeted
the unidentified scientist after
extensive interviews with more
than 300 persons associated with

                           The scientist was identified

    South Carolina agencies continue to violate citizens' privacy. This

    institute firmer rules on the collection and distribution of

    Once again South Carolina's state government has proven that it

    But last week South Carolinians learned that -- without their

Move to Ban Net 'Hate Speech' Draws
   Praise, Concern
   Fri Feb 22,12:46 PM ET
   By Bernhard Warner, European Internet Correspondent
   LONDON (Reuters) - Authors of emails and Internet postings that
   contain racist or xenophobic material may face criminal charges under
   proposed European treaty that is dividing the Internet and law
enforcement communities.
    The proposal, drafted by the Council of Europe, would essentially
outlaw the publishing of "hate
   speech" on the Internet. Welcomed by law enforcement agencies, it has
been slammed by Internet
   firms as impossible to enforce.
   The agreement would create a comprehensive legal framework for
international crimefighters as they
   strive to identify and prosecute cross-border hate crimes on the
Internet, an area politicians are eager
   to crack down on in the wake of the September 11 attacks.
   "We must harmonize the laws first so that countries can cooperate in
criminal investigations regarding
   the Internet," Peter Csonka, principal administrator at the Council
of Europe, told Reuters on Friday.
   He added that many member states have already criminalized certain
activities regarded as racist or
   xenophobic -- such as threatening a group on the grounds of race,
color or religion -- and that the
   treaty would seek to extend that onto the Net.
   FREE SPEECH OR RACIAL HATRED? The proposal has already provoked
protest from civil
   liberties groups who maintain the proposal could criminalize free
speech, and from some Internet firms
   concerned over liability issues.
   Csonka said that telecommunications firms and Internet service
providers have contacted the council
   asking for clarification on whether they would be held liable for
hate speech posted or emailed by their
   customers.
   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) typically operate a policy of
"notification and takedown," in which
   they will remove sites containing objectionable material if it's
first brought to their attention.
   Self-policing in this manner, they say, is the best way to tackle
hate speech online.
   "It's almost impossible, and this is the consensus in the IPS
community too, to monitor every single
   piece of Web space in the Internet community," said Paul Barker,
director of corporate affairs at
   Freeserve, the British ISP owned by France's Wanadoo .
   Csonka said the liability concerns raised by ISPs and Web site
operators have not yet been addressed.
   Civil liberty groups have also objected to the proposal, fearing it
could bring the more rigorous
   anti-hate speech laws that exist in continental Europe to the more
liberal UK and U.S.
   For example, it is unlawful to post or sell Nazi regalia or
propaganda on the Internet in France and
   Germany, but there are few legal curbs in the U.S. and Britain.
   "This proposal could potentially outlaw free speech," said Malcolm
Hutty, general director for
   Campaign Against Censorship on the Internet in Britain, or CACIB.
"That would be a great
   infringement of civil rights."
   CACIB and sister organizations of online rights group, the Global
Internet Liberty Campaign, have
   begun to formulate a campaign to raise awareness for the new policy.
   The Convention on Cybercrime is the fruit of unprecedented
international cooperation, receiving input
   from 43 European countries plus the United States, Japan, Canada and
South Africa.
   Drafted by the Council of Europe, a pan-European legal forum which
works for the harmonization of
   laws across the continent, the treaty would need individual
ratification by each before it is adopted into
   law. It has so far been signed, but not yet ratified, by 32 nations.
   The "hate speech" amendment is expected to be brought into the
convention this July, officials said,
   after the current public input period ends.

PHOENIX (AP) - Pressure in a "gas ax" used by police to break down walls
and subdue suspects may have caused one of the devices to malfunction
and kill an officer during a training exercise, authorities said.
Scottsdale police Sgt. Tom Hontz was killed and 11 other officers
slightly injured Wednesday when the device exploded during the exercise
at two vacant homes in suburban Gilbert, police said.
Authorities issued a nationwide warning to law enforcement agencies
about the device and asked the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and

"The reason the thing exploded is there was too much pressure inside of
it," said Sgt. Jim Lahti, [Ed note: D'oh] a Gilbert police spokesman.
"We are investigating why."

FRESNO  Carolyn Condit, wife of embattled Ceres Congressman Gary

National Enquirer Thursday. In the
                   lawsuit, Carolyn Condit contends the National
Enquirer libeled her when it
                   reported that she had verbally attacked Chandra Levy
during a telephone
                   conversation just days before Levy disappeared.
Condits lawyers said that call
                   never took place.
                   The Los Angeles-based firm of Johnson & Rishwain is
representing Condit. The
                   firm specializes in invasion of privacy issues.
Neville Johnson, who appeared with
                   Carolyn Condit as the suit was filed in U.S. District
Court in Fresno, said Condit
                   has been considering the suit for a while, though he

                   He added that Carolyn Condit has never spoken to
Levy, who was last seen
                   April 30. The former Washington, D.C., intern from
Modesto has been linked
                   romantically to the congressman.

@_subject: hackers judges and kiddie p0rn, the adventure continues 
By JACK LEONARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER
A mysterious Canadian computer hacker who allegedly stole an electronic
diary purporting to detail the sexual fantasies of an Orange County
judge admitted to authorities that he's hacked into thousands of other
computers, according to a police affidavit made public this week.
The hacker's credibility--and whether he worked on behalf of
authorities--is emerging as a central question in the case against Judge
Ronald C. Kline, who stands accused of downloading child pornography to
his home and courthouse computers.
The hacker worked with Canadian police on at least one high-profile
child porn case, the police affidavits said, but he was also suspected
of possessing pornography and under investigation by the U.S. Customs
Bureau. The hacker, who was not named in the affidavit, describes
himself as a "predator hunter" who accessed a diary and pornographic
images on Kline's computer, which was eventually turned over to
authorities last summer, the affidavit states.
Irvine detectives and federal agents used the hacker's evidence to
obtain a search warrant of Kline's home and courthouse computers.
The search unearthed more than 100 images of photographs showing young
boys engaged in sex acts.
But in their latest court filings, Kline's defense attorneys attacked
the hacker's credibility, saying that taking the judge's diary was
illegal and suggesting that the hacker was working on behalf of law
enforcement at the time.
If a judge agrees that the hacker was indeed a police agent, the
computer evidence could well be thrown out of court.
Defense attorneys also raised the possibility that the hacker could have
doctored the diary and computer images that form the bedrock of federal
prosecutors' case against Kline.
"A person who can" hack, wrote attorney Paul S. Meyer in the court
papers filed last week, "can also enter a personal computer secretly and
alter its contents and add materials not previously present."
The latest filings offer the best portrait yet of the shadowy figure
whose computer work ultimately led to last November's federal grand jury
indictment of Kline, who also faces separate state child molestation
charges. Kline has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and is
running for reelection on the March 5 ballot.
Irvine police learned about the hacker's infiltration of the judge's
computer from Julie Posey, founder of the Colorado-based Internet
watchdog group, Pedowatch, which received an anonymous tip along with
Kline's diary from the hacker.
The hacker, the affidavit says, told Posey he was working as an
informant for customs agents.
The computer diary detailed intimate thoughts that the author described
about boys he met at an Orange County Little League baseball club,
particularly about one 13-year-old player.
"I gave a lot of thought today about this business of approaching these
kids too fast," the diary says, according to the affidavit. "You have to
make them come to you or it doesn't work."
After receiving the diary, Irvine detectives were left with the task of
trying to track down the hacker, documents show. They finally found him,
even though the anonymous tipster did his best to hide his tracks.
Hacker Said to Be on Both Sides of Law
The hacker did not return e-mails from investigators. Customs officials
served a summons for information from the company that provided the
hacker with an e-mail account. But the address turned out to be phony.
Irvine Det. Ron Carr eventually discovered a Web site the hacker was
operating. He called Vancouver police to help contact the company that
owned the site.
But the Canadian police said they actually knew all about the operator
of the site, who turned out to be the hacker Carr was searching for.
The hacker, the Royal Canadian Mountain Police told Carr, was "essential
in the apprehension" two years ago of a father suspected of offering his
8-year-old daughter for sex over the Internet.
Canadian authorities told Carr that the hacker, who allegedly possessed
"large quantities of child pornography," was no longer working as an
informant, according to the court documents.
But the hacker had recently been on the other end of an investigation.
Customs agents told Carr that the hacker was considered a suspect in at
least one federal child pornography investigation last year, the records
state, though they provide no other details about the case.
In August, Carr and a customs agent flew to Langley, British Columbia--a
small town just outside Vancouver--to interview the hacker.
There, he told the officers how he created a virus to infect the
computers of suspected traders in kiddie porn. The virus allowed him to
examine the contents of each machine he infected.
Between 2,000 and 3,000 computers worldwide had been infiltrated by the
virus, he told the officers.
The hacker described his virus as "the Trojan Horse" because it is
attached to an Internet file that is downloaded onto the computer.

             By D. IAN HOPPER, AP Technology Writer
             WASHINGTON - Microsoft's new version of its popular Media
             Player software is logging the songs and movies that
customers play.
              The company changed its privacy statement Wednesday to
             customers about the technology after inquiries from The
             Press.
             The system creates a list on each computer that could be a
treasure for
             marketing companies, lawyers or others. Microsoft says it
has no plans
             to sell the data collected by Media Player 8, which comes
free with the
             Windows XP (news - web sites) operating system. The company
             last month it had sold more than 17 million copies of
Windows XP.
             "If you're watching DVDs you don't want your wife to know
             you might not want to give her your password," said David
             Microsoft's lead program manager for Windows Media.
             The media player has been bundled as a free addition to
Windows for
             several years and allows users to play music CDs, DVD
movies and
             digitally stored songs on their computers.
             When a CD is played, the player downloads the disc name and
             for each song from a Web site licensed by Microsoft. That
             is stored on a small file on each computer in the latest
version of the
             software.
             The new version released with Windows XP last fall also
added the
             same technology for DVD movies.
             Microsoft's original privacy statement informed customers
that they
             were downloading the information about CDs but never stated
it was
             being stored in a log file on each computer.
             The new statement makes clear that information is being
             for both DVDs and CDs, but does not explain how users can
             or get into the log file.
             "It definitely could have been clearer and more specific
about DVDs,"
             Caulton said.
             Clearing the list of songs and movie titles would cripple
Media Player.
             Stopping the program from collecting any more information
             mean changing the software's settings, but that would
disable Internet
             broadcasts.
             As part of downloading the information about songs and
movies from
             the Web site, the program also transmits an identifier
number unique to
             each user on the computer. That creates the possibility
that user habits
             could be tracked and sold for marketing purposes.
             Privacy experts said they feared the log file could be used
             investigators, divorce lawyers, snooping family members,
             companies or others interested in learning about a person's
             entertainment habits. It also could be used to make sure
users have
             paid for the music or movie, and have not made an illegal
             "The big picture might be the owners of intellectual
property wanting to
             track access to their property," said Peter Swire, a law
professor at
             Ohio State University.
             Microsoft said the program creates the log file so a user
does not have
             to download repeatedly the same track, album or movie
             The company said the ID number was created simply to allow
             Players users to have a personal account on the Web site
dealing with
             the software.
             Neither is sold or shared with others, and no information
is collected on
             Microsoft's servers that would be personally identifiable,
officials said.
             "This is essentially a case where it (the ID) doesn't serve
any purpose
             and it isn't used," Caulton said.
             Jonathan Usher, another Windows Media executive, said
             has no plans to market aggregate information about its
             viewing habits, but would not rule it out.
             "If users tell us that they want the ability to get
recommendations, that's something we could look into
             on the behalf of users," Usher said.
             In a recent memo, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates (news - web
sites) ordered his company to check
             for privacy and security concerns before adding new
             "Users should be in control of how their data is used,"
Gates wrote. "Policies for information use
             should be clear to the user. Users should be in control of
when and if they receive information to make
             best use of their time."
             Privacy researcher Richard Smith, who researched how Media
Player stored and transmitted the
             information, questioned why the program has to give chapter
information for DVDs at all because
             almost all discs have chapter listings in an interactive
menu within the movie.
             He said the feature seems to conflict with Gates'
             "You can really see the Microsoft culture coming through
that Gates wants to change. These guys are
             digging in their heels," he said.

[Ed note: now taking bets on how long after apprehension the suspect
hangs himself fnord in jail]
Expert: Anthrax suspect ID'd
                02/19/02
                By JOSEPH DEE
                Staff Writer
                PRINCETON BOROUGH -- An advocate for the control of
                biological weapons who has been gathering information
                about last autumn's anthrax attacks said yesterday the
                Federal Bureau of Investigation has a strong hunch about
                who mailed the deadly letters.
                But the FBI might be "dragging its feet" in pressing
                charges because the suspect is a former government
                scientist familiar with "secret activities that the
                would not like to see disclosed," said Barbara Hatch
                Rosenberg, director of the Federation of American
                Scientists' Chemical and Biological Weapons Program.
                Rosenberg, who spoke to about 65 students, faculty
                members and others at the Woodrow Wilson School of
                Public and International Affairs at Princeton
University, said
                the FBI has known of the suspect since October and,
                according to her "government insider" sources, has
                interrogated him more than once.
                The investigation into five anthrax-laced letters and
                other hoax letters -- all mailed last fall, including
                processed by Trenton Main Post Office in Hamilton -- was
                the focus of Rosenberg's talk. She also gave her
                about what the government should do to control
                weapons.
                "There are a number of insiders -- government insiders
                who know people in the anthrax field who have a common
                suspect," Rosenberg said. "The FBI has questioned that
                person more than once, . . . so it looks as though the
                is taking that person very seriously."
                She said it is quite possible the suspect is a scientist
                formerly worked at the U.S. government's military
                laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md.
                Rosenberg said she has been gathering information from
                press reports, congressional hearings, Bush
                news conferences and government insiders she would not
                name.
                During a brief question-and-answer session after her
                one man wondered whether biological agents truly pose
                significant dangers to the public, given the limited
                of deaths and illnesses caused by five anthrax-laced
                letters.
                Without mentioning other biological agents that are far
                more deadly and contagious than anthrax, Rosenberg said
                the potential for a biological attack is "catastrophic."
                Another man wondered if the FBI and other investigators
                might be focusing too narrowly on one scientist, saying,
                "New Jersey is the epicenter of the international
                pharmaceutical industry," and many people in those labs
                presumably have the skills to handle and refine anthrax.
                "I think your argument would have been a good one
                on, but I think that the results of the analyses (of the
                letters and the anthrax in them) show that access to
                classified information was essential," Rosenberg said.
                "And that rules out most of the people in the
                pharmaceutical industry. . . . It's possible, but they
                have had to have access to the information," Rosenberg
                said.
                Picking up the conversational thread, another man said,
                "People know a lot, and it's a question of what they
                to focus their knowledge on. Things are invented in
                parallel," he said.
                -- -- --
                She said the evidence points to a person who has
                experience handling anthrax; who has been vaccinated and
                has received annual booster shots; and who had access to
                classified government information about how to
                treat the bacterial spores to keep them from clumping
                together, which allows them to remain airborne.
                "We can draw a likely portrait of the perpetrator as a
                Fort Detrick scientist who is now working for a
                in the Washington, D.C., area," Rosenberg said. "He had
                reason for travel to Florida, New Jersey and the United
                Kingdom. . . . There is also the likelihood the
                made the anthrax himself. He grew it, probably on a
                medium and weaponized it at a private location where he
                had accumulated the equipment and the material.
                "We know that the FBI is looking at this person, and
                likely that he participated in the past in secret
                that the government would not like to see disclosed,"
                Rosenberg said. "And this raises the question of whether
                the FBI may be dragging its feet somewhat and may not
                be so anxious to bring to public light the person who
                this.
                "I know that there are insiders, working for the
                who know this person and who are worried that it could
                happen that some kind of quiet deal is made that he just
                disappears from view," Rosenberg said.
                "This, I think, would be a really serious outcome that
                send a message to other potential terrorists, that
                would think they could get away with it.
                "So I hope that doesn't happen, and that is my
                to continue to follow this and to try to encourage press
                coverage and pressure on the FBI to follow up and
                prosecute the perpetrator."
                -- -- --
                She expressed disappointment that the U.S. government
                last July decided against signing an international
                weapons treaty that would ban nations from developing
                such weapons.
                "It became clear from congressional testimony that the
                reason for this rejection was the need to protect our
                projects," Rosenberg said.
                During the question-and-answer period, one woman said,
                "I'm not sure that I understood you completely, but it
                seems to me that the United States government has a
                double-standard," of wanting other nations to comply
with a
                weapons ban but wanting freedom to pursue its own
                program.
                "I'm totally shocked by this information," she said,
                a wave of laughter through the lecture hall.
                "They make no bones about it," Rosenberg replied. "On
                many occasions they've argued that rules should be for
                bad guys, not the good guys."
                Rosenberg said she worries about an "enormous increase"
                in money in the Bush budget for research into
                agents. "There is already a rush for this funding," she
                The number of researchers and labs ought to be tightly
                controlled, she said. Under the current budget proposal,
                however, she says the government will be spreading
                money around to "a lot more people and a lot more
                laboratories around the country from which bioterrorists
                can emerge, as one just did.
                "By spreading around this access and this knowledge,
                we're asking for trouble.'

The writings were initially stolen from Kline's computer by a hacker,
then passed to anti-pedophile groups before being turned over to police.
A copy of the document also was e-mailed to a Register reporter.
But the intimate writings - interspersed with references to court cases,

In portions of the diary, the author describes frequent stints working
as an umpire or just hanging around south Orange County Little League

The author of the diary describes himself as an Orange County judge and
Little League umpire who owns a Porsche sports car, all traits that also

Microsoft Web Toolkit Has Security
 Loophole -Expert
 Thu Feb 14, 2:43 PM ET
 By Elinor Mills Abreu
 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A security expert said on Thursday
 that a feature that was added to make Microsoft Corp.'s new Web
 services development tool kit more secure would actually leave the
software open to attack from
 hackers.
                    The discovery comes as the software giant puts a
greater emphasis on
                    security in the hopes that computer users will feel
comfortable using its new
                    Web services, which promise access to any software
program from any
                    device over the Internet.
                    Microsoft has long been criticized as sacrificing
security for functionality in its
                    products, leaving millions of Windows users to
contend with viruses and
                    other security issues that can compromise data and
                    The new flaw was discovered in Visual C++ .NET, also
called version 7,
                    and could affect any type of software program a
developer chooses to write
                    with the tool kit, according to Gary McGraw, chief
technology officer of
                    Dulles, Virginia-based Cigital Inc., a software risk
management consultancy.
                    The flawed feature was intended to allow developers
to provide greater
                    security to the software they write for Microsoft's
new .NET Web services
                    platform, announced by the company with fanfare on
Wednesday, he said.
                    "The feature was designed and implemented
incorrectly. Instead of
                    protecting, it doesn't do anything," said McGraw,
author of a book called
                    "Building Secure Software."
 Specifically, the bug is in the software that compiles source code into
code the machine can
 understand, he said, adding that the bug allows for a common type of
security vulnerability called a
 "buffer overflow," which could allow a remote attacker to take control
of a computer.

Jury Convicts Saudi Man Charged With Lying to the FBI in Terrorism
                             Investigation
                 By Foster KlugAssociated Press Writer
                         Published: Feb 14, 2002
PHOENIX (AP) - A Saudi man was convicted Thursday of lying to the FBI
when he denied knowing one of the Sept. 11 hijackers.
Faisal Al Salmi repeatedly denied knowing Hani Hanjour, one of the
terrorists aboard the plane that hit the Pentagon, during a series of
interviews on Sept. 18 and Sept. 19, prosecutors said.
Al Salmi, 34, was the first person convicted on charges connecting him
to the hijackers. He was not charged with terrorism.
Al Salmi, who came to the United States from Saudi Arabia on a student
visa in 1997, could receive up to six months behind bars when he is
sentenced on April 29. Al Salmi has been in custody since Sept. 21.
Attorney General John Ashcroft said after Al Salmi's indictment was
unsealed in October that the government "will bring the full weight of
the law upon those who attempt to impede or hinder" the terrorism
Prosecutors said Al Salmi and Hanjour were registered at the same time
to use a flight simulator that was open to the public at a Phoenix
flight school.
Several FBI agents testified during Al Salmi's trial that he had changed
his story during the interviews, eventually acknowledging he had met
Hanjour on different occasions in the past several years.
During closing arguments Thursday, Sexton said Al Salmi was even
deceptive when he eventually acknowledged meeting Hanjour.
Al Salmi told authorities he met Hanjour twice at a Phoenix area mosque.
But the two were also seen together at a store in suburban Scottsdale
last summer.
"He clearly has a friendship that goes beyond the two times he said he
met him at the mosque," Sexton told the jury.
Al Salmi's attorney, Gerald Williams, didn't deny his client and Hanjour
had met, but told jurors there was a difference between meeting people
and knowing them.
"They are trying to get Mr. Al Salmi to admit he was connected to Hani
Hanjour but he wasn't and he's not going to admit it no matter how hard
they try," Williams said.

In your Black SOAP RFC draft [cpunks 11 Feb 02] you propose using USENET
as a broadcast medium
for encrypted messages injected via an anonymous remailer chain.  The
broadcast provides
resistance to traffic-analysis for the receiver; remailers provide
anonymity for the source;
encryption provides confidentiality and authentication for the message.
(The XML & Soap, which we admit to having very little knowledge of,
seems only to facilitate
interoperability?  You could use remailers, PGP, and USENET by
themselves, no?)
It seems it would be useful, in a client program, to have some way of
automating the extraction of messages
destined for the user.  A few ideas come to mind.
IF the message were known to be prose, a simple entropy-measure on each
of the decrypted messages would detect messages encrypted with our
public key; messages which
are not for us (including plaintext) would be turned into noise.  Both

High School Faces Fight Over Satan Reference
 Kaimuki High School's dress code came under fire Tuesday from a member
of the Church of Satan.
 The dress code singles out clothing and accessories that promote
 Satanism.
The head of Citizens for the Separation of State and Church said the
school's policy violates free speech provisions in the Constitution.
                                    KITV 4 News saw piercings, dyed hair
and bare midriffs. However, the
                                    school's written policy states the
following are not allowed in classrooms:
                                    gang-related clothing, or clothing
promoting alcohol, tobacco, profanity, or
                                    Satanism.
                                    "Just simply labeling it as Satanist
is inappropriate. It singles out one
               religion over others and you can't do that under the
Constitution," Mitchell Kahle of CSSC said.
               The head of Citizens for Separation of State and Church
said the complaint came from a member of
               the Church of Satan who works at the school. The person
was offended by the policy but wants to
               remain anonymous.
               Most students KITV 4 News talked to said they don't know
any Satanists at the school but support
               the right of religious expression.
               "Satanism, believe it or not, it is a religion. People
actually believe it. It's a way of life so if you can
               wear a shirt that says Jesus loves you, you should be
able to wear a shirt that has a pentagram on it,"
               Kahle said.
               "If people are allowed to wear bracelets that say: 'What
Would Jesus Do,' they should be allowed to
               say: 'What would Satan do,'" 10th grader Ashley Williams
               But not all agreed with questioning the policy, saying
some clothing is disruptive.
               "We go to school to learn, not to, like, it's not like a
fashion show," senior Alice Kim said.
               Department of Education (news - web sites) spokesman Greg
Knudsen said the attorney general's
               office is reviewing the policy.
               As a result of Tuesday's complaint, the reference to
Satanism in the dress code policy will be taken
               out.
               It's already been deleted from the school's Web site.
However, it's unclear how many hard copies of
               the policy exist with the Satanism reference and how
those will be deleted.

Measure would give police more privacy on   Web
By Michael Ko
Seattle Times staff reporter
A Web site that gives personal information on
hundreds of police officers and is already the
subject of a lawsuit pitting the First
Amendment against personal privacy now is
the target of legislation aimed at shutting it down.
The bill, which passed out of the state Senate Judiciary Committee on
Thursday, would allow a judge to shut down any source that sells, lists
distributes the home phone numbers, home addresses, birthdates or Social
Security numbers of police officers or court employees and shows "an
intent to
harm or intimidate."
Those named could seek damages in civil court.

                       Inquiry: Sherman Oaks resident, 19, is accused of
posting instructions on
                     how to build, use weapons.
                     By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF
                     WRITER
                     FBI agents in New York City have arrested a
                     Sherman Oaks teenager for allegedly using the
                     Internet to distribute information on how to build
                     a wide variety of explosive devices.
                     The arrest late Sunday of Sherman Martin Austin,
                     19, came two weeks after federal agents with a
                     search warrant seized two partially constructed
                     Molotov cocktails, a remote detonator and other
                     items from Austin's residence, according to a
                     federal affidavit.
                     The affidavit also alleges that Austin's Web site
                     included instructions on how to make and use
                     weapons ranging from slingshots and boomerangs
                     to smoke bombs and fuel-fertilizer explosives.
                     Austin's New York attorney could not be
                     reached for comment, but his mother denied that
                     her son had any involvement in making explosives
                     or encouraging others to do so. "At this point in
                     time, I don't want to make this a high-profile
                     drama," she said.
                     "My son is innocent," she added. "These are
                     bogus charges. He is a peaceful person. We are a
peaceful family."
                     Austin's Web site, according to the affidavit,
stated: "Many different weapons
                     and tools can be used in street fighting. Make sure
that you keep them clean
                     of fingerprints, DNA fibers (hair follicles, etc.),
especially explosives, because
                     they may not always ignite."
                     Also on the Web site, the affidavit says, was the
following message on how
                     to "defeat" police tactics: "One would attack the
poorly defended positions
                     by hurling rocks and firebombs. Since regular
police could not sustain that for
                     any longer period of time, the riot police would
have to come to their aid.
                     Then the second group of protestors would attack
the now much weakened
                     main objectives and possibly seize them."
                     Federal authorities said Austin was in Manhattan
last week to protest the
                     World Economic Forum and was arrested by New York
police Saturday for
                     allegedly participating in an unlawful assembly and
disorderly conduct.
                     A police search in New York of Austin's car,
according to the affidavit,
                     turned up electrical wiring, electrical tape, an
empty gasoline container and
                     anarchist literature.
                     After his release by New York police, FBI agents
there took Austin into
                     custody Sunday on a federal warrant that alleges he
possessed a Molotov
                     cocktail and used his Web site to post instructions
on explosive devices with
                     the intent that they would be used to commit
federal crimes.

 Arsonist Who Tried to Stop Construction Near Protected Area in Phoenix
                           Area Gets 18 Years

PHOENIX (AP) - Weeping and apologizing to his victims, a man was
sentenced to 18 years in prison for torching seven luxury homes under
construction as he tried to stop development near protected desert
Mark Sands, 50, also must pay $2.8 million in restitution, U.S. District
Judge Susan Bolton said during Monday's sentencing.
Sands cried as he apologized to his family and victims who attended his
sentencing hearing.
"I believed then - and yes, it was arrogant - that the fires and threats
would make a difference," he said. "There is no environmental or
religious excuse for terrorism of any kind."
Sands pleaded guilty in November to eight counts of extortion and one
count of using fire to commit a federal felony. Arson charges that were
part of an original indictment were dismissed.
He also admitted writing letters to the media and property owners
warning that the fires would continue as long as people continued to
build next to the protected land in Phoenix and Scottsdale. One note,
found April 29 said, "You build, we burn again."

The system would eventually include hundreds of cameras, linking

He said city officials had studied the British surveillance system,
which has more than 2 million cameras throughout the country, and

I beg to differ.  You share the "public" half of your key(s) with

Its much like a phone number, or email nym.  You give it out to those

Some folks have one RSA key pair per communication endpoint.  No need to
"publish" the "public" halves, or correlate them with each other, or
associate a
pronouncable handle with them.
[1] The only folks who should openly publish keys are those who want to

Excerpt from
about the new Minitruth:
Little information is available about the Office of Strategic Influence,
               even many senior Pentagon officials and Congressional
military aides say
               they know almost nothing about its purpose and plans. Its
               dollar budget, drawn from a $10 billion emergency
supplement to the
               Pentagon budget authorized by Congress in October, has
not been
               disclosed.
               Headed by Brig. Gen. Simon P. Worden of the Air Force,
the new
               office has begun circulating classified proposals calling
for aggressive
               campaigns that use not only the foreign media and the
Internet, but also
               covert operations.
               The new office "rolls up all the instruments within
D.O.D. to influence
               foreign audiences," its assistant for operations, Thomas
A. Timmes, a
               former Army colonel and psychological operations officer,
said at a
               recent conference, referring to the Department of
Defense. "D.O.D. has
               not traditionally done these things."
               One of the office's proposals calls for planting news
items with foreign
               media organizations through outside concerns that might
not have
               obvious ties to the Pentagon, officials familiar with the
proposal said.
               General Worden envisions a broad mission ranging from
               campaigns that use disinformation and other covert
activities to "white"
               public affairs that rely on truthful news releases,
Pentagon officials said.
               "It goes from the blackest of black programs to the
whitest of white," a
               senior Pentagon official said.
               Another proposal involves sending journalists, civic
leaders and foreign
               leaders e-mail messages that promote American views or
               unfriendly governments, officials said.
               Asked if such e-mail would be identified as coming from
the American
               military, a senior Pentagon official said that "the
return address will
               probably be a dot-com, not a dot- mil," a reference to
the military's
               Internet designation.
               To help the new office, the Pentagon has hired the Rendon
Group, a
               Washington-based international consulting firm run by
John W. Rendon
               Jr., a former campaign aide to President Jimmy Carter.
The firm, which
               is being paid about $100,000 a month, has done extensive
work for the
               Central Intelligence Agency, the Kuwaiti royal family and
the Iraqi
               National Congress, the opposition group seeking to oust
               Saddam Hussein.
               Officials at the Rendon Group say terms of their contract
forbid them to
               talk about their Pentagon work. But the firm is well
known for running
               propaganda campaigns in Arab countries, including one
               atrocities by Iraq during its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

             Wed Feb 20,11:40 PM ET
             NEW ORLEANS - Two concourses at the New Orleans
international airport were evacuated
             Wednesday because of a suspicious package found in a men's
restroom. A bomb squad found
             containers of gumbo in the box.
              About 1,000 travelers flying Continental and Southwest
airlines were moved to other concourses and
             went through security checks a second time, airport
spokeswoman Michelle Duffourc said.
             The package was found about 4:30 p.m. and the concourses
were reopened about five hours later.
             Officials said the box was suspicious because it was
wrapped with newspaper clippings showing long
             lines of passengers at the airport.
             Also, bomb-sniffing dogs "smelled something they were
trained to smell," said Jefferson Parish Sheriff
             Harry Lee. He did not elaborate.
             The package's owner had not been determined.

                 From the National Desk
                 Published 3/28/2002 8:25 PM
                 LOS ANGELES, March 28 (UPI) -- An ex-employee of Global
Crossing has been arrested for allegedly
                 posting Internet threats against his former colleagues
and Los Angeles police officers, as well as posting
                 personal information that made hundreds of individuals
vulnerable to identity theft.
                 Steven William Sutcliffe, 41, was arrested in
Manchester, N.H., on charges of posting threats on the
                 Internet and transferring the identification another
person with the intent of committing identity theft.
                 Sutcliffe was ordered held without bail in Manchester
pending a detention hearing later Thursday.
                 The FBI said that in late 2001, Sutcliffe, a former
employee of Global Crossing Development Corp.'s Beverly
                 Hills office, allegedly posted Social Security numbers,
dates of birth and home addresses on a Web site
                 along with the names of spouses and even photographs of
children and copies of signatures.
                 "At least one Global Crossing employee was the victim
of identity theft after this information was made
                 public," the FBI said in a release.
                 Sutcliffe allegedly posted threats against individual
employees on his Web site. He also allegedly
                 maintained a separate site in which he posted threats
against LAPD officers and "offered general monetary
                 rewards for the killing of law enforcement officers,
including bonuses based upon the manner in which the
                 officer was killed."
                 An FBI agent said in an affidavit attached to the
complaint that Global Crossing hired Sutcliffe in November
                 2000 as a contract employee and later as a full-time
network technician, and he worked on computers that
                 contained personnel information. He was fired in
September 2001 after Global Crossing discovered that he
                 had not revealed a prior criminal conviction on his job
                 Global Crossing, a multi-national company involved in
fiber-optic communications networks, attempted to
                 serve Sutcliffe with a temporary restraining order and
preliminary injunction to force him to remove the
                 personal information from the evilgx.com Web site. The
FBI said Sutcliffe allegedly responded by posting
                 the process server's picture on the site along with
threats to "personally send you back to the hell from
                 where you came."
                 Sutcliffe's beef with the LAPD apparently began in 1996
when two officers arrested him on an unspecified
                 warrant and again in 1997 when he allegedly interfered
with them as they contacted a suspect on the street
                 about an unrelated matter.
                 Sutcliffe allegedly vented his anger at the officers on
a Website called killercop.com and posted one of the
                 officers' badge number, work telephone number and the
area she patrolled.

Summary: Discussion of the latest (and controversial) piece of
entertainment-industry legislation designed to screw the law-abiding
citizens of the Net.
The United States is engaged in a war against oppressive regimes run by
ignorant fanatics barely able to comprehend the intricacies of modern
society. Through actions favoring the ruling class, secret midnight
and restricting public distribution of information, citizens in these
societies are unable to evolve and live as productive members of the
international community. In Afghanistan, this was evidenced by the
philosophy and practices of the now-defunct Taliban. Unfortunately, this
fanaticism has spread to the United States and evidenced by the rise of
American Techniban.
The American Techniban are led by Senator Ernest "Fritz" Hollings (D-SC)
serves as the duly-appointed Congressional mouthpiece and elected puppet
the entertainment industry cartels, having received nearly $300,000 in
campaign funding from Hollywood since 1997. Known in some circles as the
'Senator From Disney,' Hollings also bears a striking resemblance to a
younger Jack  Valenti. (Valenti, for those unaware, is CEO of the movie
industry's lobby group and the founder of America's Techniban movement.)
Brainwashed by the Gospel of Valenti, the American Techniban's goal is
simple. Under the guise of 'preserving America's intellectual capital'
supported by the funding of the entertainment industry cartels, they
seek to
sustain the entertainment industry's Industrial Age business model (and
monopolies) in the modern Information Age - where such models are
obsolete by emerging technology.
According to Techniban Leader Senator Hollings, the lack of 'ubiquitous
protections' has led to a 'lack of [high-quality] digital content on the
Internet - apparently he doesn't believe that consumers are interested
any 'high-quality digital content' outside of what is produced by the
entertainment industries. Forget the garage band in Miami or the two
teenagers producing an hour-long movie describing adolescent depression
with Dad's camcorder during Spring Break, or WashingtonPost.Com.
interpretation of the Gospel of Valenti is that if a digital content
come from an entity supporting the entertainment industry cartels it
not be a worthwhile product.  Unfortunately, many folks are of the
that since we don't require such 'security' measures for handguns
that can kill people) so why have such measures on electronic media

Google Restores Web Page Critical of    Scientology
   Fri Mar 22, 3:10 PM ET
   By Elinor Mills Abreu
   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google (news - external web site)
   Inc. restored a Web site critical of the Church of Scientology on its
   Internet search engine on Thursday while free speech advocates
   slammed the company for removing the site in the first place.
    Google said the company had only removed certain pages from the
   site because of a copyright dispute.
   "Certain pages of the Xenu.net Web site were removed from our
   search engine earlier this week in response to a copyright
   notification under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (news - web
   sites) (DMCA)," Google spokesman David Krane said in an e-mail.
   The home page for Xenu.net was "inadvertently removed" along with a
   long, two-page list of associated Web pages on Wednesday but was
   put back on Thursday, said Google spokeswoman Cindy McCaffrey.
   Neither she nor Krane were available for further comment.
   On Thursday evening, the Web site was listed fourth under Google
   search results for "Scientology" and 8th under "Church of
   A lawyer representing the Church of Scientology accused Xenu.net of
   "wholesale, verbatim copyright infringement" by allegedly reprinting
   large amounts of material on the site.
   "We don't abuse this act," the lawyer, Helena Kobrin of the Los
   Angeles firm of Moxin & Kobrin said of the DMCA. "We go very
   strictly by what the copyright laws are."
   Copyright law allows people to use pieces of copyrighted material for
   personal, education and other purposes under a so-called "fair use"
   provision. However, Kobrin said the Web site used more than was
   allowed under fair use.
   "We will do whatever we can to protect these copyrights," she said.
   "The real story here is my clients are constantly the targets of some
   really horrendous stuff on the Internet."
   The Church of Scientology, whose members include actors Tom
   Cruise and John Travolta, has mounted challenges to Web sites and
   organizations that are critical of it in the past.
   STIFLING CRITICISM
   Robin Gross, staff attorney for the San Francisco-based Electronic
   Frontier Foundation, said the Church of Scientology was trying to use
   copyright law to stifle criticism.
   "A lot of the cases using copyright to quell critics are Church of
   Scientology cases," she said.
   The DMCA protects companies that host or link to Web sites from
   being held liable if they notify allegedly offending Web sites that
there is
   a complaint about them and give them a chance to respond, Gross
   said.
   Google had to remove Xenu.net immediately, as the company claimed
   in a letter to Andreas Heldal-Lund, the Norwegian Web master of the
   site, but could have replaced it after getting a counter-notice from
   Heldal-Lund, attorney Gross said.
   "Had we not removed these URLs (uniform resource locators, or
   network address of Web pages), we would be subject to a claim for
   copyright infringement, regardless of its merit," Google said in its
   Don Marti, an activist who protested the arrest of a Russian
   programmer under the DMCA last year, said he and other activists met
   with Google on Thursday to discuss the situation.
   "Google invited us right in," said Marti, whose ad hoc group is
   "Mountain View, California, Xenu Independent Study Group."
   Google had the Web site back up before the group arrived at its
   Mountain View offices on Thursday afternoon, he said.
   "We're discussing Google's DMCA policy and trying to keep this from
   happening again," Marti said. "Google should be a fair and accurate
   representation of what's on the Internet."

Listrelev: IDs, tentacles, databases
THE STATE
Bill Designed to Force Draft Registration
[*]  Senate: The proposal would deny driver's licenses to California's
18-year-old men who do not consent to Selective Service sign-up.
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER
SACRAMENTO -- California's draft-age men, among the nation's worst at
registering with the Selective Service, could be denied driver's
licenses for failing to sign up under a bill moving through the Senate.
Despite objections that it would quash dissent to the draft and might be
used to "flush out" illegal immigrants, the bill passed the Senate
Governmental Organization Committee on Tuesday.
The little-noticed bill would have the effect of automatically
registering California men ages 18 to 26 with the Selective Service
System when they are issued their first driver's license or state
identification card. Their names, addresses and Social Security numbers
would be forwarded electronically to a federal databank, where they
would be presumed to have registered. Those who fail to give their
consent would be denied driver's licenses. Driver's license applicants
ages 15 to 17, too young to register, would be presumed to have given
their consent when they turn 18.
At Tuesday's sometimes emotional hearing, Sen. Mike Machado (D-Linden),
who served in the Vietnam War, denounced the bill as an assault on the
constitutional right of young men to dissent.
Another lawmaker, Sen. Nell Soto (D-Pomona), suggested that the bill
actually was intended to "flush out" illegal immigrants.
But a third member, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), endorsed the plan as a
sensible and cost-efficient way to induce young men to register for the
Selective Service. The draft was abolished in 1973, but since 1980,
federal law has required men ages 18 to 26 to register in case the draft
is reinstated.
If they do not sign up, they can be prosecuted as felons, an unlikely
possibility these days. More likely sanctions include loss of federal
student loans, denial of federal job-training benefits and loss of
ability to work for the federal government or in some state government
At No. 46 nationally, California is among the worst states for
compliance, proponents of the bill said. Selective Service records
showed that at least 16,000 California men who had turned 27 had failed
to register with the draft during the last three years.
The bill (SB1276) by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), a sleeper that
has stirred virtually no attention from defenders of civil liberties,
was narrowly approved by the 13-member committee on a bipartisan 7-2
It was sent to the Transportation Committee for another hearing. If
successful, it would be heard by the Appropriations Committee and the
full Senate. Its fate in the Senate is uncertain, but similar
legislation has perished in the Assembly.
"Registration is the law. I think it should be made simple and seamless
for our young men and not be punitive," Speier told the committee.
Sponsored by the Selective Service System and supported by veterans
organizations, the bill was based on laws already in effect in 15 other
states with poor Selective Service compliance records.
Virtually all have improved significantly by linking registration to
approval of a driver's license, testified Justo Gonzalez Jr. of Denver,
western regional director of Selective Service.
Speier and Selective Service officials testified that many draft-age men
fail to register because they are unaware of the requirement and may,
unknowingly, be subjecting themselves to severe consequences, such as
being rejected for a U.S. government job or loss of student aid.
They said the message isn't getting through to young men in California
through high school counseling and "reminders" that are mailed to
nonregistrants, whose names and addresses currently are provided to the
Selective Service System twice a year by the state Department of Motor
Ronald Markarian, California director of the Selective Service System,
said he believes many young men ignore such warnings because they are of
a generation that does not want to accept "personal responsibility."
At the end of 2000, he said, only 83% of eligible registrants born in
1981 had signed up.
But Machado, a Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, charged that linking
issuance of a driver's license to registration poured ice water on a
young man's right to choose to refuse to sign and face the consequences.
"Young people have the right to make a choice," Machado said. He
asserted that "our Constitution allows for dissent and protest.... This
bill fundamentally attacks the premise upon which this nation was
Further, said Machado, who voted against it, the bill sought to make the
state instead of the U.S. government the enforcer of the Selective
Service law. "You are coming to the state when the federal government
doesn't enforce its own law," Machado told Markarian and Gonzalez.
Speier rejected the notion that the bill was anti-immigrant. She said it
would apply to draft-age legal immigrants who had been in this country
for more than a year.
The bill also was opposed by the Friends Committee on Legislation, which
represents conscientious objectors and various faiths, including
Quakers, Mennonites and Jehovah's Witnesses.
But Dunn defended the bill as a "simple, pragmatic way at the least cost
to the taxpayer to get young men registered for the draft." Two other
Democrats and four Republicans agreed and voted for the bill.

Canine DNA Helps Land a Conviction

Christian Science Monitor
                         WASHINGTON - If you want to solicit door to
door in Stratton,
                         Ohio, you have to get a permit. The rule is as
simple as that, say
                         village officials.
                         Permits are easily obtained from the mayor's

                         nothing. No one has ever been turned down.
                         But that's not the problem, according to

                         and talk with residents without having to
                         first apply for permission. They also say
                         people have a right to do it anonymously -

doorstep solicitors -
                         including those on a mission from God.
                         Free-speech advocates view with alarm the
growing number of
                         local ordinances restricting such door-to-door
activity, noting that
                         the quality of free expression in America is
under siege by
                         municipalities seeking convenience, safety, and
privacy at the
                         expense of First Amendment liberty.
                         "The last decade has witnessed a dramatic surge
in the number
                         and severity of antisolicitation laws," says
Von Keetch, a Salt
                         Lake City lawyer, in a friend-of-the-court
brief filed by the Church
                         of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in support
of the Jehovah's
                         Witnesses. "Municipal officials increasingly
believe there are few, if
                         any, constraints on their ability to severely
limit door-to-door
                         evangelism in their jurisdictions," Mr. Keetch
                         The issue is not new. The US Supreme Court in
the 1930s and
                         1940s struck down a series of municipal
ordinances aimed at
                         preventing religious groups from spreading
their messages door to
                         door. The Jehovah's Witnesses fought the bulk
of those battles
                         and is again in the spotlight.
                         At the center of the Stratton case is the
village's requirement that
                         prior to receiving a permit all would-be
door-to-door solicitors
                         must first disclose their name, home address,
their employer's
                         name and address, and a description of their
planned activities.
                         Once this information is collected, a permit is
issued. Solicitors are
                         instructed that they must produce the permit
and identify
                         themselves if so requested by any resident or
police officer.
                         To officials in Stratton and their supporters,
the permit is
                         well-balanced tool that allows solicitation but
discourages criminals
                         from circulating in the village and protects
residents' privacy.
                         To the Jehovah's Witnesses and their
supporters, the permit
                         amounts to an outright ban of anonymous
door-to-door solicitation
                         and pamphleteering - including political
                         "The free one-on-one exchange of ideas is a
pillar of our
                         democracy," says Paul Polidoro, a lawyer for
the Jehovah's
                         Witnesses, in his brief to the court. "Stratton
has devalued both the
                         constitutional right of speakers to express
information and the
                         constitutional right of residents to receive it
if they so choose."
                         Abraham Cantor, a Concord, Ohio, lawyer
representing Stratton,
                         says the solicitation ordinance is different
from others that have
                         been struck down on free-speech grounds by the
Supreme Court.
                         "The Stratton ordinance does not require a
disseminator of ideas,
                         whether religious or political, to place his
name on the literature,
                         wear a badge, or outwardly proclaim his
identity in any manner,"
                         Cantor says.
                         The ordinance was upheld by the Sixth US
Circuit Court of
                         Appeals in Cincinnati.
                         The appeals court brushed aside concerns about
                         anonymous speech, despite a 1995 US Supreme
Court decision
                         that established by a 7-2 vote a constitutional
right to distribute
                         political fliers anonymously.
                         Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority
opinion in the 1995
                         anonymous pamphlet case. It says in part:
"Under our
                         Constitution, anonymous pamphleteering is not a
                         fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition
of advocacy and
                         dissent. Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny
of the majority."
                         It remains unclear how the seven justices who
                         anonymous pamphleteering will view a case
involving anonymous
                         soliciting.
                         Cantor, Stratton's lawyer, says door-to-door
solicitors do not
                         enjoy a constitutional right to remain
anonymous when they are on
                         private property.
                         "The Supreme Court has historically indicated
that the home is a
                         sanctuary," he says. "It is the right of the
homeowner to maintain
                         and retain his privacy."
                         Polidoro counters that there are easier and
more effective ways to
                         protect privacy. Residents could post "No
Trespassing," and "No
                         Soliciting," signs outside their homes and then
prosecute anyone
                         who ignores them, he says.

Privacy of Calls Affirmed
Ruling: Court defines confidential phone conversations broadly, making
lawsuits easier.
                     By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER
                     SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court
                     privacy protections Thursday by making it easier to
successfully sue
                     people who secretly tape others' phone
                     The court decided unanimously that a conversation
is confidential
                     under state law if a party expects he or she is not
being overheard or
                     recorded. Those who secretly tape others can be
liable for at least
                     $5,000 in damages for each recording.
                     Thursday's decision, which broadly defines what is
confidential, was a
                     defeat for the media, in particular broadcasters
who have been sued
                     for airing interviews with people who did not know
they were being
                     recorded. Media lawyers had filed a brief in the
case urging the court
                     to adopt a more narrow definition that would make
it harder for
                     plaintiffs to argue that remarks had been
confidential. The ruling
                     stemmed from a Los Angeles case involving
recordings a woman
                     made of telephone calls between her now deceased
husband and his
                     son. The son, who charged his stepmother had tried
to hasten his
                     father's death, now stands to collect as much as
$120,000 for 24
                     phone conversations recorded by his stepmother.
                     California has prohibited private parties from
recording telephone calls
                     without consent from all participants--only if the
calls included a
                     "confidential communication." Courts of appeal have
disagreed over
                     what constituted a confidential conversation.
                     In their brief to the court, lawyers for media
outlets including the three major television networks
                     argued that a broad definition of confidential
communication would end the use of hidden
                     microphone and camera reporting in California. The
ruling also could make it more difficult for the
                     print media to use material from recordings
provided by third parties.
                     Jerry K. Staub, a lawyer who represented the son in
Thursday's case, said disputes over secret
                     taping also arise frequently in the course of
litigation, when one side tapes another's damaging
                     admissions without the party's knowledge and
                     "I think that is going to stop now, and that is a
good thing," Staub said.
                     If the court had ruled more narrowly, no
conversation would be considered confidential unless
                     one of the parties at the time had declared it to
be so, Staub said.
                     The state high court ruled in a dispute between J.
Michael Flanagan and his stepmother, Honorine
                     T. Flanagan in Flanagan v. Flanagan, S085594.

America's "friends"
In a rare criticism of the kingdom's powerful
              "mutaween" police, the Saudi media has accused
              them of hindering attempts to save 15 girls who died in
              the fire on Monday.
              About 800 pupils were inside the school in the holy
              city of Mecca when the tragedy occurred.
              According to the
              al-Eqtisadiah daily,
              firemen confronted police
              after they tried to keep the
              girls inside because they
              were not wearing the
              headscarves and abayas
              (black robes) required by
              the kingdom's strict
              interpretation of Islam.
              One witness said he saw
              three policemen "beating
              young girls to prevent
              them from leaving the
              school because they were
              not wearing the abaya".
              The Saudi Gazette quoted witnesses as saying that
              the police - known as the Commission for the
              Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice - had
              stopped men who tried to help the girls and warned "it
              is a sinful to approach them".
              The father of one of the dead girls said that the school
              watchman even refused to open the gates to let the
              girls out.
              "Lives could have been saved had they not been
              stopped by members of the Commission for Promotion
              of Virtue and Prevention of Vice," the newspaper
              concluded.

Denver Police Keeping Illegal Files
                Tue Mar 12,11:09 AM ET
                By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
                DENVER (AP) - The American Civil Liberties Union (news -
web sites) has accused the Denver Police Department of
                keeping illegal files on peaceful protest groups
including Amnesty International and the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
                Friends Service Committee.
                 The ACLU's Colorado legal director, Mark Silverstein,
showed reporters files he said came from the police department.
                Silverstein wouldn't say how he obtained the files. He
said they were marked as permanent, not simply reports that would
                be discarded at the end of the day.
                "These are a small sampling of documents we have that
show Denver police are monitoring peaceful protest activities of
                individuals and law-abiding groups," he said at a news
conference Monday.
                The ACLU has asked the mayor to stop all monitoring,
make all files available to their subjects and have police disclose
                who has been given the information, Silverstein said. He
threatened to sue if the practice (news - Y! TV) isn't stopped.
                Andrew Hudson, spokesman for Mayor Wellington Webb, said
Webb had asked police for a full report to answer the
                group's concerns.
                "The mayor thinks their concerns are legitimate," Hudson
                Denver Public Safety Department spokeswoman C.L. Harmer
said police would comply with the mayor's request.
                Stephen B. Nash, who was identified in one of the files
as an event organizer for Amnesty International, said police could
                not say the files were needed for security because of
the Sept. 11 attacks.
                "My file goes back to 2000, well before Sept. 11," Nash
                The American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group,
"acts in the best tradition of nonviolence," said Barry
                Leaman-Miller, who was identified in one file as a
member of the "American Friends Service Committee (criminal extremist
                G)."
                There was no immediate explanation for the "criminal
extremist" note.
                Harmer said people named in the files were not
considered criminals and the files were collected because legal
                are sometimes the scene of illegal actions.
                "Law-abiding groups sponsoring lawful assemblies can be
unwitting magnets for unlawful activity," she said.
                "If you go to a peaceful demonstration, is your name
going to come up when you get a traffic ticket? The answer is no,
                because the data isn't shared," she said. "I don't think
this is a retreat to the era of J. Edgar Hoover."
                Harmer said that although the intelligence-gathering
started before the terrorist attacks, the attacks illustrated the need
                such files.
                Among the events mentioned in the files were a protest
of an Italian-led parade honoring Columbus, protests of a killing by a
                police SWAT team that went to the wrong house, protests
against the International Monetary Fund (news - web sites) and
                World Bank (news - web sites), and demonstrations by the
Chiapas Coalition against alleged civil rights violations in
                Mexico's poorest state.
                "This is really outrageous to me ... since Sept. 11
immigration equals terrorism," said Luis Espinosa, a member of the
                Chiapas group.

If folks were wondering why the US BoR matters:
By Kate Kelland
                   LONDON (Reuters) - The British government told police
                   to "stop and search" more suspects on the streets in
a crime-busting
                   move that critics say is racist.
                   The government hopes an increase in random searches
will cut street
                   crime and restore public confidence, even if critics
say the powers
                   could be used to intimidate ethnic minorities.
                   Home Secretary (interior minister) David Blunkett
said he wanted a
                   "stop and search program that has the confidence of
the police and
                   the confidence in the police by the community."
                   Worried by a surge in violent street crime and stung
by police
                   complaints that the legal system makes it hard to
convict criminals,
                   Blunkett is trying to change the perception that the
ruling Labor party
                   is soft on crime.
                   Opponents of his order fear that the police,
particularly in London,
                   may abuse their power by singling out young blacks.
                   Home Office data show black people are five times
more likely to be
                   stopped and searched than white people.

                   since being branded "institutionally racist" in a
1999 inquiry into its
                   handling of the murder of black London teen-ager
                   Lawrence, stabbed to death by a gang six years
                   It has since worked hard to clean up its image,
reducing the number
                   of "stop and search" actions and insisting that a
culture change had
                   swept through its ranks.
                   Last year, police in England and Wales stopped and
searched some
                   853,000 people, down 17 percent on 2000.
                   Blunkett said Monday he wanted to reverse that trend.
"Used in a
                   targeted, intelligence-led way, stop and search can
be particularly
                   effective against street robbery, gun crime and drug
dealing," he said
                   in a statement.
                   Michael Eboda, editor of the black newspaper New
                   disagreed, saying he considered stop and search to be
a "an
                   incredibly inefficient way of cracking down on
                   "The problem is that when you harass innocent
individuals -- and we
                   have to remember that 82 percent of those who are
stopped and
                   searched have actually done nothing wrong -- then all
you do is
                   alienate those people," Eboda told BBC radio.

Government guidelines published Thursday said metal detectors, which
club owners and promoters argue are too expensive to install, are now
vital if gun and knife-related violence is to be curbed in clubs.
The Home Office booklet, entitled "Safer Clubbing," said there should
also be a national survey of drugs deposited in clubs' existing "amnesty

rather than be found carrying them if searched.

                BEIJING (Reuters) - Defiant members of the banned Falun

in a northeastern

   Montana Back in Uncomfortable Spotlight After Assassination Plot Is
                                Alleged
                  By Tom LacekyAssociated Press Writer
                         Published: Mar 7, 2002
  WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) - Police say David Burgert is a trouble-making
blowhard and his alleged "Project 7"
assassination plot is probably fantasy.
But they are watching their backs. Very carefully.
"You never know. A lot of people thought something like the World Trade
Center would never happen," Police Chief Bill Dial said. "I take
extremist groups seriously. Would they have done it? I don't know. Your
guess is as good as mine."
Investigators believe Burgert's group was plotting to trigger an
anti-government revolution. Detectives say they discovered it last month
when a Project 7 member tipped them off after Burgert beat him up.
According to Flathead County Sheriff Jim Dupont, the conspirators
planned to kill judges, prosecutors and police officers in such numbers
that the National Guard would be sent in. Then the troops would be
killed, forcing the federal government into the fray and sparking a
national uprising.
How serious was the plot?
Project 7 amassed a huge arsenal - machine guns, 30,000 rounds of
ammunition, explosives, night-vision equipment, body armor and booby
traps - that Dupont estimates may have cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars. The police chief will not say how Burgert or Project 7 paid for
the arsenal.
Authorities say Burgert's girlfriend, Tracy Brockway, 32, penetrated the
Whitefish police department by getting a job as a cleaning woman, and
compiled "intelligence files" with extensive personal information on
county law enforcement officers and their families.
"When my guys were reading the 'intelligence bulletins,' some were kind
of taken aback, but at the same time they laughed," Dial said. One
officer's intelligence file "said he ate junk food and had bratty kids."
The Project 7 name refers to Flathead County license plates, which all
begin with the number seven.
Montana has gotten an image as a haven for anti-government radicals like
Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and the Freemen. Flathead County, which borders
Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana, is staunchly
conservative. Many here work as loggers or miners and are quick to
vilify environmentalists and the federal government.
But Dial dismissed any notion that Project 7 is a symptom of right-wing
radicalism directed at law enforcement. "We just view them as criminals,
as thugs," he said.
Burgert lawyer Mark Sullivan did not immediately return a call for
comment Thursday. But Brockway's lawyer, Gary Doran, said police seem to
be engaging in the sort of conspiracy theories they usually ridicule.
The charges originated with "a 17-year-old kid who got in a fight with
Mr. Burgert and went away very angry and immediately gave statements to
police officers," Doran said.
Until now, the 38-year-old Burgert has been a petty, though frequent,
problem for local officers. Because he had a criminal record in Alabama
and Colorado, Dupont barred him several years ago from joining the
county search-and-rescue team.
"He has hated me ever since - absolutely hated me," the sheriff said.
"The best description of him is, he's a 16-year-old bully with a big
The police chief in nearby Kalispell, Frank Garner, was supposedly one
of those targeted by the group. A 17-year veteran, he said he considered
it a credible threat since "not many go to these lengths."
Burgert was arrested Feb. 8 on charges unrelated to the alleged plot and
remains jailed in Kalispell, the county's largest community with a
population of 17,000. He is accused of assaulting an officer when police
came to arrest a friend who had fled to Burgert's home. Brockway is
charged with hiding Burgert while he was a fugitive on the assault
No one has been charged in the alleged assassination plot.
There are two more Project 7 members Garner especially wants to see
behind bars, and investigators are building cases against them. The
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FBI are also
Dupont and others think that Project 7 had only eight to 10 people, and
that only two or three close to Burgert may have been involved with the
assassination plot.

@_subject: The Untouchable (Anthrax Theatre Commentary by FAS) 
I. Commentary: Is the FBI Dragging Its Feet?
    February 5, 2002
For more than three months now the FBI has known that the perpetrator of
the anthrax attacks is American. This conclusion must have been based on
perpetrators evident connection to the US biodefense program. In
addition to this signpost, the perpetrator has left multiple, blatant
clues, seemingly on purpose:
second letters, addressed similarly to the anthrax letters and
containing powder, sent to most (and possibly all) the anthrax
recipients; similar letters sent to several
other media organizations; even a letter, addressed to the Military
Police at the Quantico Marine Base, accusing a former USAMRIID scientist
(with whom the
anonymous writer says he once worked) of having bioterrorist intentions.
Almost all the letters were mailed before there were any reports of
anthrax letters or of
hoax letters sent to media (see "Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks" below
for a chronology and discussion of the available data). The postal
addresses and dates of
these letters map out an itinerary of the perpetrator(s) and indicate
certain connections, which taken together must single out the
perpetrator from the other likely
This evidence permits a more refined estimate of the perpetrators
motives. He must be angry at some biodefense agency or component, and he
is driven to
demonstrate, in a spectacular way, his capabilities and the governments
inability to respond. He is cocksure that he can get away with it. Does
he know something
that he believes to be sufficiently damaging to the United States to
make him untouchable by the FBI?
The perpetrator is surely too smart to believe that either the FBIs
ludicrous recent actions or the White House protestations of ignorance
mean that the authorities
are not on to him. Blanketing Central New Jersey with fliers showing
handwriting that was obviously disguised cant possibly evoke useful
information, nor can letters
to 32,000 American microbiologists, 31,800 of whom live in a different
world from the perpetrator. This is no way to instill public confidence
in the competence of
the FBI. The press is increasingly questioning the situation, and other
scientists have independently raised similar issues (see, for example,
"In Search of the Anthrax
Attacker"  Most

IRS Asked to Revoke PETA's Tax Status
Story Filed: Tuesday, March 05, 2002 1:52 AM EST
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A group that tracks criminal acts against
businesses wants the federal government to revoke the
tax-exempt status of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
The Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise said in a complaint Monday
to Internal Revenue Service Commissioner
Charles Rossotti that ``publicly available information strongly suggests
that PETA induces or encourages the commission
of unlawful acts.''
``It's been linked to the breaking of the law. Its own people have
extensive arrest records,'' said Ron Arnold, executive
vice president of the Bellevue, Wash.-based center. ``Any kind of
law-breaking to us does not deserve tax-exempt
Norfolk-based PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said the center is preying
on people's fears of terrorism since the Sept.

for social change, no matter how peaceful.''
An IRS spokesman in Washington said he could not confirm receipt of the
complaint and that any action, such as an audit,
that could occur as the result of a complaint is not public record.

New Jersey Supreme Court limits vehicle searches
                  TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) -- Police cannot ask to
search a vehicle
                  they have stopped unless there is reasonable suspicion
that criminal
                  activity has occurred, the state Supreme Court ruled.
                  In a 5-0 decision issued Monday, the court said
motorists need protection
                  because of "widespread abuses" by police and the
state's 1999 admission that
                  troopers had practiced racial profiling.
                  Such protection will prevent police from "turning
routine traffic stops into a
                  fishing expedition for criminal activity unrelated to
the lawful stop," Justice
                  James Coleman wrote.
                  The court said the state constitution protects
                  motorists from consent searches, in which police
                  ask motorists to sign a waiver that allows them to
                  search their car without a warrant.
                  The court stressed that its ruling applies only to
                  traffic stops of individual motorists, and not to
                  traffic checkpoints or roadblocks, such as those
                  used to catch drunken drivers.
                  The ruling upheld a June 2000 state appellate
                  court decision that reversed the 1998 conviction of
                  Steven Carty, who was found guilty of drug possession
after state police found
                  cocaine in his shirt during a 1997 traffic stop.
                  Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for the state Attorney
General's office, said the
                  ruling "should really have no effect on the State
Police" because their internal
                  rules already require them to have reasonable
suspicion in order to conduct a
                  consent search.
                  The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the
state Black Ministers
                  Council, said he hoped the ruling will encourage the
state Legislature to ban
                  consent searches entirely.

Donor of Ayn Rand Manuscript, U.S. Are Not on the Same Page
                       Dispute: Giver saved a portion of 'The
Fountainhead' manuscript as a memento. It is seized.
                     By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER
                     Ayn Rand wrote the book on the chasm between
personal happiness
                     and a heavy-handed government. Leonard Peikoff
illustrated it.
                     That's how Rand fans say the empty picture frame on
Peikoff's wall
                     figures into the fight over two pages of her
original handwritten
                     manuscript of "The Fountainhead."
                     Federal officials seized the pages after Peikoff
joked that he "stole"
                     them from the Library of Congress. Peikoff, a
writer and philosopher,
                     was a lifelong friend of Rand and is an expert on
her philosophy of
                     objectivism, which teaches that individuals--not
the government--are
                     the key to the development of a healthy society. He
inherited the
                     scrawled first drafts of "The Fountainhead," "Atlas
Shrugged" and two
                     other books when she died in 1982.
                     Eleven years ago he donated the manuscripts and
other Rand papers
                     to the Library of Congress. For sentimental
reasons, he said, he kept
                     the first and last pages of "The Fountainhead" and
sent photocopies to
                     Washington with the remainder of the manuscript.
Peikoff displayed
                     the original pages under a spotlight on the wall of
his Irvine home.
                     The groundbreaking 1943 novel helped define Rand's
                     Part of that doctrine contends that man's pursuit
of self-interest
                     requires government's willingness to step out of
the way.
                     But it is Peikoff who said he was forced to step
aside when a government agent showed up at his
                     front door in January. The official cut Rand's
manuscript pages from his picture frame and
                     confiscated them as federal property.
                     The irony of the seizure is not lost on Rand
                     "Ayn Rand, I feel sure, would have said: 'The whole
case is another outrage by looting
                     bureaucrats so drunk with power that they must
possess and flaunt even the very pages in which I
                     have denounced them,'" Peikoff said.
                     Yaron Brook, head of the Marina del Rey-based Ayn
Rand Institute, agreed. "Ayn Rand
                     portrayed the government as never happy with the
power it has. The bureaucrats always want to
                     take more."
                     Peikoff, 68, became acquainted with Rand in 1951
after reading "The Fountainhead" as a
                     17-year-old.
                     "It had changed my life," he said. "I took the
train from Winnipeg, Canada, and went to her house
                     in Chatsworth to meet her."
                     Soon, he was among those who would have 10-hour
philosophical discussions with the
                     Russian-born author.
                     Rand embraced Peikoff's work when he began
interpreting her philosophy in his own writings.
                     Eventually, she wrote the introduction and reviewed
each chapter of his book on objectivism,
                     "The Ominous Parallels." It analyzed the
philosophical causes of Nazism and their parallels in
                     contemporary America.
                     Peikoff's decision to donate Rand's papers to the
Library of Congress came after he was
                     hospitalized in 1991 with a heart attack. Years
earlier Rand had talked of sending them there. So
                     Peikoff had an assistant load 11 boxes of
manuscripts, proofs and other documents and ship them
                     off--minus the original first and last pages of
"The Fountainhead."
                     Peikoff said he later sent a private appraiser to
Washington to attest to the value of the Rand
                     papers and to tell officials that two of the
"Fountainhead" pages were copies. The appraiser
                     reported back to him that the library didn't care,
Peikoff said.
                     But in 1998 Peikoff was interviewed for a Los
Angeles Times Magazine article about a
                     resurgence of interest in Rand's work. The
interviewer spied the framed manuscript pages on the
                     wall and was taken by the famous opening paragraph
written in Rand's own hand: "Howard
                     Roark laughed."
                     Peikoff explained that he had given the 2,158-page
"Fountainhead" manuscript to the Library of
                     Congress. "But I stole the first and last pages,"
he added with a laugh. The throwaway line was
                     included in the lengthy magazine article published
Aug. 16, 1998.
                     Library officials weren't laughing when they read
the piece. They demanded the missing
                     "Fountainhead" pages, claiming them to be property
of the U.S. government.
                     When Peikoff refused to turn them over, officials
threatened to sue him for $1.1 million--the
                     amount the library had spent "in storing, archiving
and preserving the manuscript" in the belief it
                     was the complete original.
                     Peikoff scoffed at the claim. If library officials
had even looked at the documents, they would have
                     noticed the obviously photocopied pages and the
appraiser's report, he said.
                     After he hired a lawyer, library officials offered
to let Peikoff temporarily keep the two pages,
                     provided that he post a $30,000 bond and place a
sign on his home's wall beneath the frame
                     reading: "On Loan From the Library of Congress." He
                     His lawyer told Peikoff that he probably would win
the lawsuit, but warned that the outcome was
                     far from certain under the theory of "promissory
estoppel" that courts often use in cases involving
                     gifts.
                     "I'm 68 and a heart patient and could not accept
the prospect of being further weakened
                     physically by the stress, and perhaps even
bankrupted in a fight against what is now, it seems, a
                     virtually omnipotent government," Peikoff said. "I
capitulated ... this was the payment I received
                     from the Library of Congress for my gift."
                     Library officials denied being heavy-handed. They
said Peikoff signed an "instrument of gift" giving
                     the government ownership of Rand's papers and a
letter confirming that he had sent "the complete
                     materials."
                     "The library did not know that Dr. Peikoff had kept
two pages of the manuscript. The library
                     relied on Dr. Peikoff's presentations that the
manuscripts were complete," officials said in a federal
                     court complaint.
                     But George Houle, a West Los Angeles rare book
expert who traveled in 1991 to Washington to
                     appraise Peikoff's donation, said he informed
officials that two of the "Fountainhead" pages were
                     photocopies.
                     "The appraisal made note of the fact they were
facsimiles," Houle said. "His remark about
                     'stealing' them was clearly flippant. He didn't go
to the Library of Congress and steal them."
                     Houle said he was surprised by the library's
treatment of the Rand papers during his inspection
                     trip. "The librarian had them in a cardboard box.
She almost spit on them. She was not a fan of
                     Ayn Rand. She made some disparaging remarks about
Ayn Rand," Houle said.
                     Library of Congress spokeswoman Helen Dalrymple
denied that the librarian mistreated the Rand
                     materials or looked upon them with disdain. The
library had sought Rand's papers for years,
                     Dalrymple said. And Houle did not tell her
colleagues of the photocopies, she said.
                     Dalrymple asserted that Peikoff's treatment of the
two pages he withheld was not the best,
                     however.
                     "From being in the frame the ink had faded and the
paper had turned a different color," she said.
                     Peikoff, meantime, vowed to never again give
anything to the Library of Congress. And he said he
                     has given up on ever seeing his beloved manuscript
pages again.

Excerpts from Group seeks to set portable audio player standards
Co-organizer White said the group will take up where SDMI left
off on portable devices but that it will work to avoid the
mistakes that SDMI made.
Industry observers believe that SDMI grew too large for its
structure and had too diverse a membership base to agree on
anything. For instance, the group could not reach consensus on
a standard framework for digital audio content protection for
portable devices.
That was because the record labels held so much power in the
group that their concerns about content piracy became the
priority, some observers claim. SDMI became inactive shortly
after executive director Leonardo Chiariglione left in January
"After SDMI did not work out real well, Jim [Fleming] came to
me," White said. As the two saw it, "the record industry had its
concerns, and the IT group at SDMI [which comprised computer
manufacturers] had certain things they intended to do, but the
consumer electronics industry really never was represented as a
group at SDMI."
White said the new group seeks to change that. One task will be
to correct the lack of standards for portable-device content
The new group will differ from SDMI in that it will focus on
player-device vendors and their suppliers, and there will be
requirements for membership. Neither Fleming nor White would
say whether content providers, such as record labels, will be
allowed to join. They said they will leave that matter up to the
group's members.

building gets illegal immigrant
                     noticed. Deportation looms.
                     By JENNIFER MENA, TIMES STAFF
                     WRITER
                     The ice cream vendor never imagined that the
                     FBI would be interested in his home video of
                     downtown Santa Ana. He was not thinking
                     post-Sept. 11, an era of new sensitivity about
                     anyone taking pictures of federal buildings.
                     Carlos Vasquez, a Mexican immigrant, filmed the
                     Ronald Reagan Federal Building for a video he
                     wanted to send to relatives back home. But the
                     activity was brought to the attention of federal
                     authorities who discovered he was an illegal
                     immigrant and now plan to deport him.
                     The FBI said Vasquez is just one of thousands of
                     people interviewed after Sept. 11 on grounds that
                     they may know something about terrorist activity.
                     With the new vigilance, activities near government
                     offices that were once considered innocuous now
                     often catch the attention of law enforcement.
                     "There is a heightened sensitivity to anyone
                     federal buildings. This sensitivity was not there
                     before Sept. 11," said Matthew McLaughlin, a
spokesman for the Federal
                     Bureau of Investigation.
                     Vasquez, 35, said he included Santa Ana's federal
building, at 411 W. 4th
                     St., in his video because it was part of the city's
skyline. The video was taken
                     with the most expensive item he's bought since
coming to the United States in
                     1990: a $1,200 camera bought on a payment plan at
Circuit City.
                     While he was outside the building Dec. 6, he said,
his filming was stopped by
                     security guards and he was interviewed by Santa Ana
police, who wrote
                     down his driver's license. On Dec. 11, FBI agents
were at his doorstep.
                     Within three weeks, Vasquez was sent to an
immigration detention center in
                     Lancaster for one month, then released on bond.
                     Vasquez said he came to the United States 11 years
ago and was hoping to
                     become a legal resident. He said he had submitted
an application for
                     residency through his brother, who is a citizen, in
April. He put his earnings at
                     $250 a week selling ice cream from a 1976 van.
                     "What really hurts is the injustice and
discrimination," said Vasquez, in the
                     room he rents for $350 a month in Santa Ana. "I
came here to work and
                     make money to survive."
                     But McLaughlin said other people who have been
questioned for possible
                     terrorist activity have also been referred to the
Immigration and Naturalization
                     Service if they could not prove legal residency.
                     In the weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center
                     and Pentagon, Middle Eastern immigrants who came to
authorities' attention
                     as possible suspects also were targeted for
deportation if they were found to
                     be in the United States illegally.
                     An INS official said Vasquez's deportation case is
not about whether he
                     videotaped a building but whether he is in the
country legally.
                     "I would put the onus back on the individual. If he
wanted to stay in the U.S.,
                     he should have gotten legal status," McLaughlin
                     "We have set protocols. He is not being singled
out. He was taking video of
                     a federal building. You do not know what his intent
is until you investigate."
                     Vasquez said the FBI interrogated him on five
occasions, repeatedly asking
                     him whether he knew a man who he believes is of
Middle Eastern descent.
                     Vasquez said he knew the man only by sight from his
visits to a store where
                     he bought ice cream for his truck.
                     Vasquez said he was given several lie detector
tests. INS records show that
                     he failed two polygraph tests that were
administered by the FBI.
                     Vasquez said he believes he failed because the
questioner kept rephrasing a
                     question--whether he knew the man from the ice
cream store and whether he
                     was asked by another person to film the
building--until he answered
                     incorrectly.
                     McLaughlin said Vasquez was not forced to be
interviewed and that the lie
                     detector tests were voluntary. At any time, Vasquez
could have stopped the
                     interview or test, he said.
                     Civil rights advocates say the case demonstrates
how the new vigilance can
                     usurp personal freedoms.
                     "It's an example of the kind of overaction and
reaction that violates human
                     rights day in and day out now," said James
Lafferty, executive director of the
                     National Lawyers Guild in Los Angeles.
                     Immigration authorities took Vasquez's driver's
license, so he has been
                     unable to work.
                     The driver's license was obtained legally, before
the state required drivers to

One wonders how G.I. Joe sells in Iran?
AP) Iran has introduced its version of
Barbie and Ken: twin dolls Dara and
Sara, who promote traditional values
with their modest clothing and
pro-family stories.
The Dara and Sara dolls, one a boy
and the other a girl, were developed
and are being marketed by the Institute
for the Intellectual Development of

government agency affiliated with the
Ministry of Education.
They are widely seen as an effort to
counter the American dolls and
accessories that have flooded the
Iranian market, though institute

  that that was not the main goal.
  "The dolls are most welcome. Dara and Sara are strategic products
  to preserve our national identity. And of course, it is an answer to
  Barbie and Ken, which have dominated Iran's toy market," toy seller
  Mehdi Hedayat said.
  Another toy seller, Masoumeh Rahimi, said Barbie was "foreign to
  Iran's culture" because some of the popular Western dolls wear
  revealing clothing. She said young girls who play with Barbie, a doll
  she sees as wanton, could grow into women who reject Iranian
  values.
  "I think every Barbie doll is more harmful than an American missile,"
  Rahimi said.

Judge Says Amateur News Gatherers on Public Access TV Have Same Rights
                            as Professionals
                  By Justin PopeAssociated Press Writer
Published: Mar 6, 2002
BOSTON (AP) - A federal court has ruled that nonprofessional news
gatherers have the same rights as professionals, supporting a community
gadfly who claimed she was muzzled by a public access cable company.
It is the first ruling of its kind, said the American Civil Liberties
Union, which represented plaintiff Patricia Demarest in her fight with
Athol/Orange Community Television.
"It will open so many more doors for common citizens to use public
access as a public forum and a place to speak their minds," said
Demarest, co-producer of the program "Think Tank 2000."
"It's a fight for any common citizen to bring forth ideas and generate
healthy communities."
Demarest used the program to accuse local officials in the central
Massachusetts town of Athol of conflicts of interest.
But after she broadcast the grilling she gave one official, she was
suspended by the cable company, whose board is appointed by the city.
The company also changed its rules to ban controversial programming,
requiring broadcasters to get written permission from anyone they
Last week, however, U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor in Springfield
ruled that such shows constitute a "public forum" and have First
Amendment protection.
AOTV lawyer Peter Epstein said he had not read the verdict and could not
The cable company said after several controversial broadcasts in 2000
that the regulation requiring written consent was necessary to prevent
unfair coverage.
The ACLU argued that would prevent coverage of any public official.
Cable access provides the same opportunity to share ideas as printed
leaflets and soap boxes did in the past, said Bill Newman, director of
the western Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU.
"Citizen producers of shows are entitled to the same First Amendment
protections as producers of shows for large media outlets," Newman said.
The judge essentially agreed, writing that the requirement "made news
makers news editors. By refusing to sign a release form, Athol's news
makers could ensure that their images did not appear on AOTV."
Ponsor also struck down an AOTV rule that prohibits broadcasters from
showing illegal acts. Such a requirement, he said, would have prevented
the broadcast of "some of the most important moments in American
history," including footage of the Bloody Sunday attack on civil rights
marchers in Selma, Ala.

influence on people."
                 The study reviewed more than 1,500 previously secret,

                 documents made public through a landmark 1998 tobacco
settlement. Under the

Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown
                 & Williamson and Lorillard -- pledged to make payments
for 25 years to reimburse
                 public costs of treating sick smokers.

Many interesting articles for the animal loving domestic terrorist... or
Walking Through a Grand Jury
by Larry Weiss, Attorney at Law
In this article Attorney Larry Weiss walks us through a typical grand
jury proceeding for an
activist. He shows how easily a committed activist who puts the animals
first can be jailed at
a grand jury. His article is quite scary. Think about it, when they
start asking you about your
friends, their beliefs in direct action, your significant other, your
involvement with animal
rights, who you associate with, and other personal questions, are you
going answer them?
If you do, you can bet the people you mention will also be harassed;
they will have more
information to use against you, your friends, and the animals; and
mistrust and fear will
spread within the movement because no one knows what you said about them
(the public is
not allowed and grand jury hearings). In a grand jury, there are no
innocent questions, and
there is no such thing as a harmless answer. Cooperating with a special
grand jury is selling
out the movement.
The following is a summary of what you might expect to encounter if you
are subpoenaed to appear
before a federal grand jury.
1. Your subpoena will be served on you by law enforcement personnel or
FBI agents. Do not
attempt to talk to the person who serves the subpoena, or explain why
you should not be involved.
They will only use your statements against you.
2. Don't panic. There are organizations that deal with just such
situations. Don't be afraid to get in
touch with such organizations or with an attorney who is experienced in
grand jury matters. Tell
them about your subpoena. The worst thing that you can do is isolate
yourself or give up hope.
3. You will have to go to the building (probably a courthouse) where the
grand jury is located on
the day and time mentioned on your subpoena. Take friends and/or an
attorney with you. Again, do
not isolate yourself. The FBI would like nothing better than for you to
feel alone and helpless.
4. After you arrive at the courthouse you will probably have to sit and
wait for one or several hours.
Then you will go into the grand jury room. Your attorney and your
friends will not be allowed to go
in with you. Although your attorney can not come into the grand jury
room, he or she may wait
outside the room. You may go out of the room to consult with your
attorney as often as you like.
Simply tell the U.S. Attorney, "I need to talk with my attorney". You
may want to go out after each
question (and before answering) to talk with your attorney. That is your
right and, if the U.S.
attorney will not let you go, then simply refuse to say anything until
you are allowed to talk with your
5. You will be asked your name, followed by a short series of
innocent-sounding questions. Finally,
the real inquisition will begin. You will be asked about people you may
or may not know, who they
are and what their political views are. You may be asked to identify
pictures of people, or whether
you attended meetings or demonstrations with them. There is no "right to
remain silent" in front of a
grand jury. Most people will want to take the Fifth Amendment to avoid
testifying. If you decide
that you want to take the Fifth Amendment, you should do so as soon as
you have given your name.
People often think that they can outsmart the government attorney who is
asking the questions, but
this is not wise. If you have already answered some questions on the
same subject that you now
want to refuse to answer, you may end up waiving your right to take the
Fifth Amendment.
6. To take the Fifth Amendment you simply say "I refuse to answer on the
ground that it may tend
to incriminate me" or you can simply say "I take the Fifth Amendment on
this question." Then you
simply repeat that for each question.
7. After you have taken the Fifth Amendment for one or several
questions, the U.S. Attorney may
ask you to go in front of a judge. When he/she mentions this, and if you
are not represented by an
attorney, you should ask for a public defender to represent you.
You will then go before a U.S. District Court judge. This hearing, where
you are given immunity
despite all of your objections, is called the immunity hearing. If you
have not been given a public
defender, tell the judge that you want a public defender and that you
have already asked the U.S.
attorney for one. The judge may or may not comply with your request for
a public defender.
The judge will ask you if you have taken the Fifth Amendment and you
reply "yes". The U.S.
Attorney may then offer you "immunity". This means that anything you say
in front of the grand jury
cannot be used against you in court in a criminal case. However, you
must understand that your
answers to questions can be used against other people in court and
anything that they say may be
used against you. So you still could face criminal charges on the same
subject that you are being
asked about.
Also, you need to understand that the immunity you are given will not
protect you against civil cases,
loss of job, deportation or any other penalties. So don't be fooled into
thinking that you are getting
something great when they give you "immunity". They are just giving it
to you so that you won't be
able to take the Fifth Amendment anymore, because the grant of immunity
neutralizes your ability to
take the Fifth Amendment.
8. Even if you don't want to accept the immunity, and tell that to the
judge (which it is probably wise
to do, so that you can prove later that you didn't want the immunity),
you don't really have a choice.
They can give you immunity whether you want it or not. The judge will
now explain to you that you
must answer the questions asked by the U.S. attorney and, in fact, will
order you to answer the
9. You will be taken back before the grand jury and asked the same
questions again. You can now
answer them or refuse to answer them. If you answer the questions
falsely, you may be charged
with perjury, which is a serious federal felony. If you still refuse to
answer the questions, you will be
charged with contempt. This is the most critical moment of the whole
proceeding, so you should
think about this before you even go into the grand jury and decide on
your course of action.
10. Let's assume that you still refuse to answer the questions. You will
be taken back before the
judge, probably the same judge who saw you before and charged with
contempt. This procedure is
called the contempt hearing. The first thing to do is to ask to have an
attorney (a public defender)
appointed for you. You have a right to an attorney at the contempt
hearing and the government has
to appoint one for you if you cannot afford one. So insist on your right
to an attorney, and ask for a
continuance to talk to your attorney if one comes in that you have never
seen before.
The court, however, will probably want to proceed then and there. Your
public defender is
supposed to help you at this hearing. You will be asked if you have in
fact refused to answer the
questions. If you say "yes", the court may now hold you in civil
contempt. You don't have the right
to a trial or a jury, or anything like that. So don't expect to have any
of the procedural protections
that are given to people accused of crimes. In the eyes of the law,
civil contempt is not a crime,
though it will feel that way to you.
11. After you are held in contempt, the judge will probably order you
handcuffed and taken away
to jail right away. So you should be prepared when you come to the
initial grand jury session to go
to jail that day, and have all of your personal business in order.
Before you are taken to jail, you (or
your attorney) should ask the judge to let you out on bail and to "stay"
the jail time. This is for the
record, because the judge will probably refuse your motions and have you
taken to jail anyway.
If you know about the jails in your area, you can ask the judge to have
you taken to one facility that
is closer to your friends or family, rather than to another one which is
farther away. Explain your
reasons for wanting to go to a certain facility to the judge. Again, the
judge will probably refuse your
requests, however reasonable they are, but you need to make these
motions anyway in order to get
the fact that you made them into the transcript. This may help you
later. If you have a lawyer, she/he
will make many of these motions for you. If you are not represented or
your public defender doesn't
do anything, then you may have to make them yourself.
12. During all of these proceedings (which may only take one day), do
not be afraid to discuss your
case with your friends and supporters. Tell them what happened in the
grand jury room. You have a
right to talk about what went on before the grand jury. Do not let
yourself get isolated. You may
even want to talk to the press, though you should think about what you
are going to say before you
do this.
13. Now you have been held in contempt and taken to a local jail. Your
first question will be, how
long can they keep me? The answer is that they can keep you for a
maximum of 18 months or until
that grand jury completes its term, whichever comes first. Therefore, it
is important to find out when
the grand jury began its term and when it will finish its term. The
grand Jury term is usually 18
months, though this is subject to an extension in some instances.
If you are held in contempt toward the end of the grand jury term, that
is better for you, since that
means there is less potential time for you to sit in jail. This is one
reason to contest everything that
the U.S. attorney does, because the court will have to hear your
motions., and that decreases the
time until the end of the grand jury term.
14. Another way you can get out of jail is by going back before the
grand jury and answering their
questions. This is called "purging the contempt." You will certainly
dislike jail and there will be a
temptation to do this. Remember, however, that you went to jail because
you believed in a
principle, and that principle has not changed.
15. While in jail you can file motions to get out. The law says that the
jailing cannot be to punish you
but rather to get you to talk to the grand jury. In legal terminology,
this means that the intent of the
jailing must be coercive rather than punitive. This distinction matters
very little when you are actually
in jail. However, it is important legally because your lawyer(s) can
file motions to get you out of jail
early based on the fact that the jailing has now become punishment.
Though it may sound strange,
the firmer you are in your resolve not to talk, the stronger your case
becomes for an early release,
because your lawyer(s) can then argue that the jailing is having no
coercive effect.
16. If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, request the kind of food that
you can eat. Put your request in
writing. Many jails now provide vegetarian meals.
17. Be prepared to be harassed by the guards or other prisoners. Someone
may try to befriend
you, but that person may be working for the FBI. So beware of talking to
people that you didn't
know from before.
18. Most importantly: while in jail, remember why you took this stand in
the first place. You are
doing a brave act. You are there because you believe in a cause, and you
have not been forgotten.
Many people are working to get you out, so stay strong.

I've been thinking about noncentralized self-organizing network
topologies since George
posted his query.  First, there are several problems that any P2P
network faces in the future
hostile world:
    1. ISPs blocking its ports
    2. The "entry points" to P2P are vulnerable ---web sites that point
to dynamic list of *tella
    servents, or the Kazaa site that points to active Kazaa supernode
servents.  Simply sue
    any of the sites with lists of *tella hosts.  Even better, get the
ISPs to drop host lists
    as fast as they drop stuff under DMCA.
    3. Slow connections, slow machines
    4. Active, hostile attacks, not just doofuses querying with
too-common keywords
To resist 1. you can use port 80, which ISPs can't block without losing
'legitimate' utility for the masses :-)  Or you use randomly varying
ports and have to do more door-knocking.
To resist 2. you have to be able to randomly probe IP addresses to find
a node.
To manage 3., nodes should announce their capacities and the network
should work with this info.
(Cf. self-management in Morpheus/Kazaa, where users can disable the
'supernode' function).
Caching probably helps a lot.
So what you have is your client randomly 'knocking on doors' looking for
someone to answer with
the handshake that means, 'yes, I'm in the network'.  Then the knocker
asks to join, and joins
the resident's "cell" :-) or is told to try another known to be in the
I then started thinking about how to keep nodes connected in a single
connected graph.  I ended up
with an algorithm which I realized resembled funky tree
growing/balancing algorithms I had seen
in datastruct/algorithm CS classes years ago.  Only the nodes were
hosts, the links were communication links (IP addr=pointers) instead of
in-memory locations & pointers.  Nodes can add children, keep track of
parents (and several great-ancestors for redundancy), and defer requests
to join to their children.  When nodes
leave, they tell their children to reparent to the leaving-node's
parent.  When parents defer join-requests
to their children, they first do an application-ping to see if the child
is still alive.  When the 'root' node
leaves, it tells each of its children that they are each other's
parents, to keep the graph connected.
I'm going to code up a simulation when I get the time, with nodes
randomly receiving join requests and
randomly leaving, gracefully and not gracefully.
This does not handle various hostile/spoofing attacks, crypto
authentication, content-finding-query routing,
managing slow connections, etc. Its about keeping a virtual network
Now that I write it up, I realize a tree has the flaw that child nodes'
queries must go through slow upstream links.
So I will think about algorithms to grow meshes dynamically, robustly,
to overcome that problem.

Hacker to Be Key in Trial of Judge
[*]  Courts: Attorneys for Ronald Kline of Irvine argue that Canadian
police had doubts about child porn informant.
wo months before child pornography charges were filed against an Orange
County judge, Canadian authorities expressed "serious doubt" about the
work of a hacker who allegedly discovered illegal photographs on the
jurist's home computer, according to court documents filed this week.
Police used the information from the unidentified hacker to obtain a
search warrant for Judge Ronald C. Kline's home in Irvine, where they
allegedly found more than 1,500 computer images of child porn.
The credibility of the hacker--and whether he violated the judge's
constitutional rights--are expected to be key elements in Kline's
upcoming federal trial. Kline's attorneys argued in court documents
filed Monday that a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigator told
Irvine police that the hacker, who lives in Canada, was breaking the law
and could not be used as an informant.
"Our problem is how do we continue to receive information from him with
the knowledge that the method he is using to extract the information
identifying the bad guys is illegal," wrote Investigator George Barnett
in a Sept. 6 e-mail to an Irvine detective.
"There is some expectation of privacy on the part of the bad guys."
Irvine police, however, contend that defense attorneys have quoted the
e-mail out of context. Investigators said the hacker's methods are
irrelevant to the case because he was not acting as an agent of law
enforcement when he hacked into Kline's computer.
Barnett's e-mail, they said, discussed the possible legal problems
investigators would face if they used future tips from the hacker.
"It had nothing to do with the Kline investigation," Irvine Police Det.
Ron Carr said. "It was a conversation between us about using him [the
hacker] in the future."
Barnett said through a police spokesman that he could not comment while
the case is pending.
Kline, 61, has pleaded not guilty to six charges of possessing child
pornography. He also pleaded not guilty to separate state charges of
molesting a 14-year-old boy more than two decades ago.
In the latest federal court filing, Kline's attorneys said that others
also questioned the hacker's credibility.
The head of Predator-Hunter, a Cleveland-based Internet watchdog group
that claimed the hacker as an informant, expressed concerns about the
hacker to Irvine police.
Predator-Hunter's founder, Michael Vaughan, wrote to Carr in January:
"I have recently confirmed how horrifyingly dirty [the hacker] is....
[The hacker] appears to represent a greater threat to children than the
'Judge' or any predator we have IDed to date."

A federal judge prohibited Culver City from removing signs a resident
had posted on city property encouraging residents to vote in the

Wednesday, stating that Culver City unconstitutionally enforces its
ordinance banning signs in the public right of way.
LOS ANGELES
Judge Stays Culver City's Ban on Signs
[*]  Civil rights: Removal of one poster but not others is ruled
City workers and police twice pulled down nonpartisan signs paid for by
Lynne Davidson, 48, instructing residents to "Vote for a Change" on
April 9. Culver City, like many others, has a sign ordinance prohibiting
posters in the public right of way, regardless of their content.
Davidson's signs urged residents to vote and did not advocate a
Davidson said she sued the city because its uneven enforcement of the
code infringed on her free speech rights. More than 20 types of signs
violating the ordinance can be found in Culver City at any time,
including banners for city-sponsored events. Her attorney argued in
court documents that the city singled out Davidson's signs and left many
others untouched.
Feess said the city sometimes hangs banners over the public right of way
advertising city-sponsored events. The judge ruled that the city cannot
post such signs and ban others.
It is a violation of the 1st Amendment "to say the city can pick and
choose content in violation of the ordinance ... particularly when
talking of issues of core speech" such as political signs, he said.
Davidson said low voter turnouts in the Culver City elections prompted
her to spend $3,500 on the signs.
"The people elected are not representative of the whole community unless
people get out and vote," she said.

Boise to be test target for Marine snoops
                 From the National Desk
                 Published 3/30/2002 3:33 PM
                 BOISE, Idaho, March 30 (UPI) -- In a bid for a more
realistic training experience, Marine Corps
                 reconnaissance teams will attempt to evade nosey
neighbors and noisy dogs as they prowl the streets of
                 Boise in a mock infiltration exercise this spring.
                 The city and the Marines announced Friday that about
two-dozen leathernecks would attempt to infiltrate
                 Boise during practice intelligence-gathering missions
sometime between May 6 and 10.
                 Although the Marines routinely practice their craft in
mock urban settings on military bases, some skills
                 can only be honed in a genuine city.
                 "What happens in these urban training facilities is we
don't have dogs; we don't have garbage trucks driving
                 down the street and we don't have the rhythms that you
would see in your day-to-day life," Maj. Chandler
                 Hirsch told a news conference.
                 The scenario of the exercise conducted by the Marine
Corps Warfighting Laboratory calls for 24
                 reconnaissance-team members to fly to a National Guard
training facility outside Boise in late April. The
                 Marines will then attempt to slip into the city, spy on
specific targets and then get out of town unnoticed;
                 other Marines will act as enemy sentries guarding the
target buildings.
                 Hirsch said the Marines would be wearing military-style
clothing and would not be carrying loaded weapons.
                 They will also not go on to private property. The goal
is for the Marines to carry out their missions without
                 being noticed by Boise's 186,000 citizens.
                 A Marine will be assigned to the Ada County 911 center
to monitor any calls from suspicious residents, and
                 a Boise police officer will serve as an escort for each
team in the event a civilian who didn't get the word
                 attempts to intervene.
                 Such exercises by the military are not unusual. A
similar larger-scale exercise last month in North Little

"The more subtle but less obvious dilemma is of a student who may room

person who is an American student ... in a sensitive area," said Harpel,
organization represents 213 public universities in every state in the
US colleges complain of anti-terror laws
In a little-noticed anti-terror initiative, the George W. Bush
administration is trying to get colleges and universities to stop some
foreign students from studying sensitive subjects. Educators fear
they're being dragged into academic censorship.
 "We have a responsibility to work with the government, and we're ready
to do so, but we're afraid of being turned into course police," said
Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on
Education, which represents 1,800 public and private colleges.
 The issue arose in October when Bush directed the government to
prohibit certain international students from receiving "education and
training in sensitive areas" involving the "development and use of
weapons of mass destruction."
 The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is working with
federal agencies to "identify sensitive courses of study."
 A White House Fact Sheet issued with the presidential directive
ordering the studies said: "A goal of the program is to prohibit the
education and training of foreign nationals who would use their training
to harm the United States and its allies."
 Academic leaders say they are being largely shut out of what has become
an internal government debate.
 "They've got law enforcement agencies and national security and
intelligence agencies who want to be more restrictive, and they have
research and science and technology officials who are trying to explain
how academic research works," said George Leventhal, policy analyst with
the Association of American Universities. The group represents 63
universities heavily involved in scientific research.
 Other nations are beginning to train more of their homegrown
scientists, but the US remains a major destination for academics seeking
advanced scientific or engineering degrees. A National Science
Foundation report says the percentage of foreign-born scientists and
engineers is growing at all degree levels in America, with the highest
ratio, 45 percent, in engineering.
 The White House says the government wants to work with the academic
 "Recommendations that will come out of the interagency working group
will include the academic and science community being consulted on the
finer points of any final response," Kathryn Harrington, a spokeswoman

 Academic groups see more questions than answers.
 "Once a student is granted a visa and tries to change from organic
chemistry to biochemistry, what are we supposed to do? Move them out?"
said Richard Harpel, director of federal relations for the National
Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges.
 "The more subtle but less obvious dilemma is of a student who may room
with a person who is an American student ... in a sensitive area," said
Harpel, whose organization represents 213 public universities in every
state in the country.
 An electronic tracking system to be in place by the end of the year is
supposed to enable instant communication between the government and
academic officials so the State Department and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service are notified of any change in a student's visa

@_subject: another reason to avoid airbus: surveillance 
Airbus, the European jet manufacturer, is planning to build concealed
cameras into the light fittings above the seats in its aircraft. The
idea is to let the crew monitor passengers and spot hijackers before
they strike. The cameras also work in the dark.
The move is part of an attempt to reassure people who have been
frightened off flying since the 11 September attacks.
At an airline technology conference in Prague last week, a delegate from
the VALK Foundation said that before 11 September, none of the 4000
people it has helped to overcome their fear of flying had ever cited
hijacking as the root of their fear. But since then it has become the
main fear for a third of its clients.
The industry hopes that well-publicised improvements in airline security
will quell passengers' fears. Airbus, working with American aerospace
technology company Goodrich, thinks the best strategy is to let
passengers know that everyone is being watched by hidden cameras.
Infrared image
One plan Airbus is considering, says the firm's cabin security expert
Rolf Gvdecke, involves hiding a tiny camera inside the light fittings
above each passenger seat, surrounded by a ring of infrared LEDs. The
cameras will normally work with ambient light, but switch to infrared
when the cabin is dark.
Black-and-white images captured by the cameras will be fed to screens in
the cockpit via the cables used to distribute pictures to seat-back
video screens. Although only some lights will have cameras, potential
terrorists will not know which ones.
A less ambitious system, which Airbus is now fitting to all its new
planes, will monitor the area behind the cockpit door. Under new rules,
cockpit doors are being reinforced to protect the flight-deck crew from
attackers. But they still need to open the door to get to the toilets
and to let cabin crew members bring them meals and drinks. So Airbus is
putting three overhead cameras with wide-angle lenses around the cockpit
door to send pictures to an LCD screen in the cockpit.

For the Spy in the Sky, New Eyes
FLYING in his helicopter, Sgt. Frank Sheer of the Orange County
Sheriff's Department in Southern California can be literally miles from
the action. But that does not mean that he and his co-pilot do not know
what's going on. In fact, Sergeant Sheer says they often have a clearer
picture of a crime scene than the officers who are there.
"We'll be tracking a suspect on a hillside from the helicopter," said
Sergeant Sheer, the chief pilot in the Orange County force, "and the
deputies climbing up it will be saying to us, `There's nobody here.'
We've actually had them step on a guy who pulled up a bush for cover."
It's not just having a bird's-eye view that gives Sergeant Sheer and
many other airborne police officers, rescue workers, military personnel,
and television news and movie crews almost paranormal vision. Nor is it
simply advances in optics and cameras. Ultimately they all rely on
complex camera stabilization systems that mix mechanical and electronic
technologies to produce steady images, even at high magnification, from
inherently unsteady craft like helicopters and boats.
When officers pursued O. J. Simpson along the freeways of Los Angeles
eight years ago, a covey of police and television news helicopters
tracked him with stabilized cameras hanging at the sides in their
distinctive ball-shaped pods. But most helicopter surveillance is not
that dramatic. If the Orange County Sheriff's Department needs a car
discreetly followed, Sergeant Sheer can keep tabs on it from 3,000 feet
up and a considerable distance behind  a position that would leave most
motorists unaware there was a helicopter around, let alone watching
New systems built around all-electronic motion-sensing technologies are
so stable that only the horizon and haze limit how far away observers
can be.
The use of airborne stabilized cameras to create films or follow
athletes in action attracts little controversy. Nor does anyone dispute
that the systems allow police officers to capture criminals or rescue
people. Some privacy advocates, however, are concerned that the recent
proliferation of airborne cameras and the growing capabilities of new
systems may mean that anyone who steps outside may unknowingly be a
target of an aerial eye. Outdoors, there may no longer be any place to
"Because technology affords police what amounts to superhuman vision,
that doesn't mean we lose all expectations of privacy," said Barry
Steinhardt, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's program
on technology and liberty. "There are lots of innocent people who are
going to have their privacy invaded  observed naked in their backyard
sunbathing from far away."
There is a long history of efforts to produce steady airborne pictures.
But in the early years, the results were for the most part dismal.
Steven Poster, the president of the American Society of
Cinematographers, recalls his first attempt at photography from a
helicopter, in the late 1960's. "It was an Illinois State Fair, and the
stabilization came from a rope tied around me to the helicopter," Mr.
Poster recalled. "I quickly realized that this was not a very good
While more sophisticated systems existed back then, they did not differ
much from Mr. Poster's rope. Known as side mounts, they generally relied
on bungee cords and the user's body to isolate the camera.
By the 1980's Mr. Poster was a director of photography for feature films
and television advertisements, and he had found an answer to his aerial
photography problems with a system made by Wescam, a company now based
in Burlington, Ontario.
"It's the best way to stabilize a camera," said Mr. Poster, who has used
the system in films like "Stuart Little 2," which is to be released this
The Wescam system used by Mr. Poster's film crews is remarkably similar
to the original Wescam developed in the early 1960's by a Canadian
subsidiary of Westinghouse as a battlefield surveillance tool for the
Canadian military. (Wescam is short for Westinghouse camera.)
Eliminating the vibration from the helicopter was the first step and the
easy part. The Wescam ball is attached to a helicopter or airplane
through a shock absorber that uses springs and other damping materials.
"It is tuned for the natural frequencies of helicopters," said Mark
Chamberlain, a mechanical engineer who is president and chief executive
of Wescam.
But eliminating the vibration does nothing to limit three other kinds of
movement by the camera: pitch (plunging up and down), yaw (rotating
around a vertical axis) and roll (the side-to-side rotation that creates
a moving horizon).
To deal with these kinds of movements, inventors of the original Wescam
turned to large gyroscopes, which create inertia. It is like strapping a
large boulder to the camera to stabilize it, yet without all the weight
that a boulder would add.
Inside the camera ball are three gyros oriented to offset each of the
three types of unwanted motion. Motors attached to the camera mount
allow an operator within the helicopter to view images from the camera
on a video monitor and point the camera as needed.
The gyro stabilization system proved so steady that it has not
significantly changed over the last three decades. But the system has
one significant drawback: the gyros require frequent maintenance.

        BILL TEXT
        AMENDED IN ASSEMBLY  MAY 15, 2002
        AMENDED IN ASSEMBLY  APRIL 4, 2002
INTRODUCED BY   Assembly Member Havice
                        FEBRUARY 14, 2002
   An act to add Section 53087.6 to the Government Code, relating to
law enforcement.
        LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
   AB 1941, as amended, Havice.  Rave parties:  permits.
   (1) Existing law requires notification of law enforcement of the
issuance of a permit for an upcoming event in limited instances such
as the holding of a certified farmers market.
   This bill would require a local permit granting authority to
notify the local law enforcement agency when it is considering
granting a permit for a rave party, as defined.  The bill would
require the local authority to require the promoter to present
evidence that the promoter is sufficiently knowledgeable about
illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia to recognize their presence at
the event.  The bill would require the promoter  to apply for any
required permit not less than 30 days prior to the event and  ,
prior to the issuance of the permit, to acknowledge in writing that
he or she or his or her agents will not permit, condone, or ignore
violations of state and local laws regarding the presence,
possession, sale, or use of drugs and drug paraphernalia at any event
covered by the permit.  The bill would create a state-mandated local
program by imposing new duties on local agencies.
  (2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse
local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the
state.  Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that
reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund
to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide
and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed
   This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates
determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state,
reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these
statutory provisions.
   Vote:  majority.  Appropriation:  no.  Fiscal committee:  yes.
State-mandated local program:  yes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
  SECTION 1.  Section 53087.6 is added to the Government Code, to
   53087.6.  (a) As used in this section, "rave party" means any
electronic music dance event of the type commonly referred to as rave
parties that may be attended by 500 or more persons.
   (b)  In any jurisdiction where a permit is required, the
promoter of a rave party shall apply to the local permit granting
authority for a permit not less than 30 days prior to the scheduled
event and, at the same time, shall notify the local law enforcement
agency having jurisdiction over the venue of the proposed event.  The
promoter shall include in the permit application a list of all
applications that the promoter has submitted for a permit to conduct
a rave party within the previous 12-month period.  The promoter shall
include an affirmative statement that the promoter understands that
the listing of previous applications is correct to the best of the
promoter's knowledge and that submission of false and misleading
information may be grounds for denial of a current and future
   (c)  Any local permit granting authority shall notify the
local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the proposed
location of the event when it is considering whether or not to grant
a permit for a rave party.  The permit granting authority shall also
require the promoter of the event to present evidence before the
issuance of the permit showing that the promoter is sufficiently
knowledgeable about illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia that they or
their agents can recognize the presence of drugs and drug
paraphernalia at the event.
   (c)
   (d)  Prior to the issuance of the permit, the promoter of the
rave party shall acknowledge in writing that he or she or his or her
agents will not permit, condone, or ignore violations of state and
local laws regarding the presence, possession, sale, or use of drugs
and drug paraphernalia at any event covered by the permit.
  SEC. 2.  Notwithstanding Section 17610 of the Government Code, if
the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains
costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and
school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7
(commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the
Government Code.  If the statewide cost of the claim for
reimbursement does not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000),
reimbursement shall be made from the State Mandates Claims Fund.

Supreme Court Rules on Bus Searches
                Mon Jun 17,12:32 PM ET
                By GINA HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
                WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court ruled Monday that
                who want to look for drugs or evidence of other crimes
do not have to
                first inform public transportation passengers of their
legal rights.
                The ruling gives police guidance on how to approach and
                passengers, a case with renewed interest as officers
seek out possible
                terrorists on public transportation.
                The case focused on the difference between police
questioning on a bus
                and in a less confining environment, such as a sidewalk.
In both
                instances, police would need permission or probable
cause to search
                someone, but the justices rejected arguments that
passengers, confined
                to small spaces, might feel coerced to go along.
                The court ruled 6-3 that officers in Tallahassee, Fla.,
were within their
                rights as they questioned and searched two men aboard a
                bus in 1999.
                Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority,
said the
                passengers did not have to be told that they didn't have
to cooperate.
                The Bush administration invoked the war on terrorism in
asking the
                Supreme Court to get involved in the case, but the court
majority did
                not specifically refer to that argument. Kennedy did
note that public
                transportation riders understand the risks from
potential criminals in their
                midst.
                "Bus passengers answer officers' questions and otherwise
cooperate not
                because of coercion, but because the passengers know
that their
                participation enhances their own safety and the safety
of those around
                them," Kennedy wrote.
                Three officers boarded the bus, bound from Fort
Lauderdale to Detroit.
                One officer introduced himself to Christopher Drayton
and Clifton
                Brown, and told them he was looking for illegal drugs
and weapons.
                He asked to pat down the men's baggy clothing. The men
agreed, and
                officers felt hard objects on the men's legs that turned
out to be packets
                of cocaine.
                "It is beyond question that had this encounter occurred
on the street, it
                would be constitutional. The fact that an encounter
takes place on a bus
                does not on its own transform standard police
questioning of citizens
                into an illegal seizure," Kennedy wrote for the court.
                On the street, the person being stopped could simply
refuse to
                cooperate and keep walking. Unless police had good
reason to pursue
                the person further, they would be free to go.
                Drayton and Brown argued that they did not have the same
option while seated on the bus. They were
                convicted and sentenced on drug charges.
                The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ( news - web
sites) ruled the cocaine should not have been
                admitted as evidence, because the officers failed to
tell the men they were not required to cooperate.
                That court said the encounter violated the
Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.
                Monday's ruling overturns that decision.
                In a dissent, Justice David H. Souter said that three
officers "pinned-in" passengers on the stopped bus.
                "The situation is like the one in the alley, with
civilians in close quarters unable to move effectively,
                being told their cooperation is expected," wrote Souter,
who was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens
                ( news - web sites) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( news - web
                He said because of terrorist concerns, airplane
passengers know they must submit to searches.
                "The commonplace precautions of air travel have not,
thus far, been justified for ground transportation,"
                Souter wrote.
                Donna Shea, legal director of the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said police
                will use the ruling as justification for aggressive
                "I think police will continue intimidating passengers,"
she said. The ruling "gives bus passengers a lesser
                expectation of privacy. I think that's
                The case is United States v. Drayton, 01-631.

                  The reason: Saudi men have been reported to use the

                  Religious police chief Ibrahim Al Ghaith, has urged
the kingdom to ban the

dealers, including Saudi
                  Ericsson, where they are said to be a popular item
among Saudi men.
                  Saudi officials do not expect a decision to ban the
cellular phones.
                  They are capable of taking more than 280 digital
photographs and cost more than
                  $400.
                  One concern is that Saudi men have slipped the

society and women in public are

"He's kind of like a Matt Drudge, but more immature," a fellow student

Wetmore had a pretty shaky relationship with the administration by April

Wetmore brought his video camera, suspicious that Gore was drawing a
large fee and reasoning that "there should at least be a record of her

Midway through her speech, campus police officers approached Wetmore and
demanded that he hand over the tape. After a scuffle, he was arrested
and sent to a campus disciplinary panel, which placed him on probation
and removed him from his elected office as dorm president. Among the
charges: theft of Gore's intellectual property by videotaping her
The case has outraged free speech watchdogs and civil libertarians, who

Philadelphia-based advocacy group that has hired a lawyer for Wetmore.
"This was just plain thuggishness."
American University officials say that they were protecting Gore's
rights while preserving order in the auditorium and that Wetmore
escalated the situation by refusing to comply with campus police.
"We have our conduct code, and we expect students to adhere to it," Dean
of Students Faith C. Leonard said. "If there are violations, they will
be adjudicated by an impartial hearing body."
Wetmore's supporters say the school's actions are part of a trend of
colleges using restrictive discipline to silence critics. This spring at
West Virginia University, administrators attempted to corral protests in
designated "free speech zones." At the University of California at San
Diego, administrators briefly charged student journalists with
"disruption" for taking photos at a public meeting.
The debate echoes the political correctness battles of the 1980s and
1990s, when campus administrators tried to ban hate speech and some
conservatives complained of an academic climate that shouted down their
voices. The Wetmore case, though, might be driven less by ideology than
by something noted by another of his supporters: "He's annoying."
Wetmore said his interest in Gore's speech, which included a
presentation of her published photos, was prompted by a rumor that the
campus was paying her tens of thousands of dollars. College sources
would not disclose the fee, although they say it was much less.
"If we're going to spend so much to have her talk, let's tape it so that
people who aren't there can see it," Wetmore said last week.
At Gore's speech, he sat in the bleachers toward the back of Bender
Arena. An organizer announced at the start that flash photography was
prohibited but said nothing about videotaping, so Wetmore set the camera
on his lap and started it rolling.
Campus officials were disturbed when they spotted the camera -- Gore's
contract with the university stipulated that her presentation could not
be recorded. According to documents from Wetmore's disciplinary hearing,
an officer was sent to tell Wetmore to stop taping and go to the lobby.
Wetmore refused. Another officer joined them, but Wetmore refused to
leave or relinquish his tape. The confrontation started to distract the
audience, according to university documents.
A third officer arrived, and Wetmore agreed to go to the lobby. But when
he refused to hand over the tape, a scuffle erupted. Wetmore says he was
pushed against a wall, threatened with Mace, pushed to the floor and
After about an hour at the campus public safety office, he was released

Court rules student's artwork not a threat to police
     Published 9:35 a.m. PDT Thursday, August 1, 2002
     CHICO, Calif. (AP) - A Pleasant Valley High School student's art
class painting that
     showed him shooting a police officer who had cited him for
possessing marijuana did
     not constitute a criminal threat, a state appeals court has ruled.
     The youth, identified in court papers only as Ryan D., never showed
his painting to
     Chico Police Sgt. Lori MacPhail, the state Court of Appeals in
Sacramento said
     Tuesday. The court said that paintings are ambiguous as a statement
of intent and that
     the artwork didn't amount to a threat.
     The painting showed the boy "shooting the officer in the back of
the head, blowing
     away pieces of her flesh and face," the court noted.
     "Without question, it was intemperate and demonstrated extremely
poor judgment,"
     presiding Justice Arthur Scotland wrote in his opinion. He added
that "it does not
     appear to be anything other than pictorial ranting."
     The appeals court dismissed a finding by Butte County Superior
Court Judge Ann
     Rutherford that the teenager had made a terrorist threat against
MacPhail but let the
     marijuana violation stand.
     MacPhail said Wednesday she was disappointed by the ruling.
     "It's unfortunate that that could be the interpretation," she said.
"It was clear and
     straightforward to me it was more than just a painting."
     MacPhail cited the teenager on Dec. 8, 1999, for possessing
marijuana while off the
     high school campus during school hours. A month later, Ryan D.,
then 15, turned in a
     painting for his art class that showed a boy shooting a female
police officer in the head.
     The artwork also included the letters "CPD," for Chico Police
Department, and "67,"
     MacPhail's badge number.
     The art instructor found the painting "disturbing" and "scary" and
showed it to school
     administrators, who then showed it to MacPhail.
     The appeals court said there was no evidence the teenager ever
intended to show the
     officer his artwork, Scotland noted.

receivers by 2006, say people familiar with the matter.
TV makers say the mandate would boost the price
of a TV by about $200, dampening sales.
Broadcasters, who have pushed for such a rule,
dispute the figure.
Lets see... they think they can require crap in TVs, in teleco
equiptment... anyone still doubt they will try a power
grab on the motherboard?

Dress Code Keeps 9 Hells Angels Out of Fair in Ventura
Security: The new policy is enforced after biker club members refuse to
remove vests marked with group's insignia. Their leader says he will
                     By TRACY WILSON and HOLLY J.
                     WOLCOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS
                     Nine Hells Angels were denied entry to the
                     Ventura County Fair on Wednesday evening after
                     refusing to remove black leather vests
                     emblazoned with the trademark winged skull of
                     their motorcycle club.
                     Stopped at a side entrance, the bikers were told
                     by a security guard their clothing violated a fair
                     policy that bans gang attire.
                     The guard told George Christie Jr., president of
                     the Ventura Hells Angels chapter, and his
                     associates that they would have to remove any
                     clothing bearing the name of their group to enter
                     the fairgrounds.
                     "I want to exercise my rights as a United States
                     citizen," Christie responded. Holding up two
                     tickets, for himself and the 9 1/2-year-old
                     daughter of his fiancee, Christie asked, "You will
                     not accept these tickets?"
                     Security guard Mike Priester then handed
                     Christie a copy of the fair's dress code policy and
                     again told him he could not come through the gate
                     unless he removed the clothing bearing the Angels
                     insignia.
                     As he walked away from the fairgrounds, Christie
called the policy
                     unconstitutional and said he will file a lawsuit
challenging it.
                     "I take offense," he said. "We are not a street
gang, we are a motorcycle
                     club.... We are going to seek legal action."
                     Ventura attorney Kay Duffy, who had walked with the
Hells Angels and a
                     few of their family members from the group's nearby
clubhouse to the
                     fairgrounds, said she had hoped fair organizers
would back down from the
                     policy and allow the Angels inside.
                     "The next step is the court system," she said.
                     Fair spokesman Devlin Raley said organizers had no
choice but to turn
                     Christie and the others away.
                     The dress policy aims to create a safe atmosphere
for families to enjoy the
                     fair, said Raley, adding that it will be enforced
during the 12-day fair that
                     began Wednesday.
                     "They chose not to comply with the dress code. It
was a challenge of the
                     policy and the policy was enforced," Raley said,
adding that the conversation
                     with the Angels at the gate was peaceful.
                     Concerned about gang violence, the fair board
recently approved a tighter
                     policy on gang attire. The policy specifically
prohibits anyone wearing
                     clothing, visible tattoos or other articles bearing
the name or insignia of a
                     criminal street gang from entering the fairgrounds.
                     It does not ban the wearing of specific colors or
sports team logos unless
                     clothing has been altered to symbolize a gang.
                     "This doesn't prevent anyone from coming to the
fair," Ventura Police Lt.
                     Ken Corney said this week. "You just can't be
wearing gang attire."
                     The policy identifies 27 local groups as criminal
street gangs--including the
                     Hells Angels and rival Mongols motorcycle clubs.
                     Christie and lawyers representing the Hells Angels
contend there is no
                     evidence the club meets the legal definition of a
criminal street gang.
                     But police say recent convictions stemming from a
                     drug-and-racketeering case involving the Hells
Angels prompted law
                     enforcement officials to deem the organization a
criminal street gang.
                     Corney said revisions to the fair's decade-old
dress code were prompted by
                     a recent appellate court decision in which justices
in Northern California
                     found a similar dress code unconstitutional. The
ruling stemmed from a
                     lawsuit filed by a Hells Angels member who was
denied entry to the Sonoma
                     County Fair after refusing to remove a vest
emblazoned with the club name.
                     The appellate court found the dress code vague and
                     Unlike the Sonoma decision, Ventura lawyers and
police say the new policy
                     is specific and are confident it would withstand a
legal challenge.

                           Associated Press
                           WILMINGTON, Del. -- Police in Delaware are
trying to get a
                           head-start on cracking crimes before they
happen by setting up a
                           database that contains a list of people who
officers believe are likely
                           to break the law.
                           Defense attorneys and the American Civil
Liberties Union oppose
                           the database, which lists names, addresses
and photographs of the
                           potential suspects -- many of whom have clean
                           The precise grounds for putting a person on
the list aren't clear. But
                           since the system was introduced in Wilmington
in June, most of the
                           200 people included in the file have been
minorities from poor,
                           high-crime neighborhoods.
                           State and federal prosecutors say the tactic
is legal, but defense
                           lawyers object to the practice.
                           "We should enforce the existing laws, but not
violate them, to catch
                           the bad guys," said Theo Gregory, City
Councilman and public
                           defender. "We've become the bad guys, and
that's not right."
                           Mayor James Baker called the criticism
"asinine and intellectually
                           bankrupt."
                           "I don't care what anyone but a court of law
thinks," he said. "Until a
                           court says otherwise, if I say it's
constitutional, it's constitutional."
                           The pictures are being taken by two
Wilmington police squads
                           created in June to arrest drug dealers. The
units are known in some
                           neighborhoods as "jump-out squads" because
they jump out of cars
                           and make quick arrests.
                           Many of the people whose photos have been
taken for the file were
                           stopped briefly for loitering and let go.

DVDSynth is an open platform for developing various "virtual devices,"
particularly virtual CD/DVD-ROM drives and virtual discs to put in them.
One of the most
interesting things it can do is apply filters to physical devices in the
system. Filters can change the contents of a CD or DVD in arbitrary ways
on the fly. This early
release of DVDSynth contains only the filtering support together with
the following three filters:
     DVD subtitler: This filter effectively adds a new subtitle track to
a DVD, by inserting new data into the MPEG stream and updating the
various navigation
     pointers on the fly. Since it works at the device-driver level,
it's compatible with all software and hardware DVD players. It comes
with a fairly sophisticated
     subtitle rendering engine which supports asynchronous overlapping
subtitles in multiple fonts and colors, fade-in and fade-out, the full
Unicode character set,
     vertical Japanese "sidetitles," etc.
     Unrestrict DVD: This filter removes various usage restrictions from
a DVD, including region lockout, APS (Macrovision), and disabled
     menu call, angle change, and so forth.
     SCSI protocol spy: This lets you monitor the SCSI commands and data
passing to and from your drive, in the tradition of such utilities as
FileMon, RegMon
     and Spy++. It's useful for debugging, and interesting to watch if
you're curious.

Wouldn't it be cool if a paki gunman shows up at a .gov NOC, just like
he did at the CIA some years back?
                    VeriSign Inc has stopped providing access to
information about the .gov internet domain, which is restricted to
                    US government bodies, over concerns the data could
be used in planning internet attacks, ComputerWire has
                    learned. On September 16, the company posted a
notice on its web site saying that from September 13 (three
                    days earlier) it would no longer provide FTP access
to the so-called "zone file" for .gov, which contains the IP
                    addresses of all the name servers that point to .gov
domains. Ken Silva, VeriSign's director of networks and
                    security, told ComputerWire the company had removed
access to information "of potential value to hackers", and
                    that the decision was made "in conjunction with" the
General Services Administration, which administers the .gov
                    zone file.
                    Silva pointed out that while VeriSign manages the
.com, .org and .net zone files, and continues to make those
                    available to those willing to enter a no-cost
agreement with the company, it does not run .gov, and merely made
                    the data available as a free informational service.
Malicious hackers wanting to take down government web sites
                    would hypothetically be able to do so by
denial-of-service attacking the name servers associated with .gov
                    domains. It was not immediately clear if the .gov
zone file data is made available in bulk from other sources, but
                    the GSA does not seem to do so. Also removed from
the FTP site was the zone file for in-addr.arpa, which is
                    used for reverse-DNS lookups (when somebody wants to
find out what domain is associated with an IP address,
                    rather than the other way around)
                    It seems so logical to take that .gov WHOIS info
offline that you have to wonder why it wasn't done
                    last year. After all, who really needs to do WHOIS
look ups on government sites except hackers, mail
                    spammers that are harvesting government email
addresses and fearful folks who like checking where
                    the IP's of mysterious visitors to their web sites
originate from... I wonder whether the same will be

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online "anarchist scavenger hunt" proposed for
next week's annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and World Bank ( news - web sites)
here has raised the ire of police, who fear demonstrators
could damage property and wreak havoc.
Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a Washington D.C.
police car tire to win 75
points. Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate executive
or World Bank delegate.
D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a congressional hearing
on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were, "so deleterious
to security efforts that we ought
to take proactive action."
Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate outside the IMF and
World Bank headquarters
next weekend.
The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based anarchist group, is also
planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major corporations in the
downtown core.
Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site who declined to give his last name, told Reuters his
scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.
"People were asking for things to do when they come to D.C. We made the
list to get people thinking, so they don't do the boring, standard
stuff," he said. "I doubt people will actually keep track of what they
do for points."

                Gordon tells The Progressive. "As we go to the check-in
counter to check in our
                baggage, the woman takes our IDs and types in our names,
and then says, 'There's
                something wrong with my computer.' So she goes and gets
another woman, who types
                our names into her computer. She, too, says, 'There's
something wrong with my
                computer. Please step aside so we can check the other
people in.' "
                Gordon says she and Adams thought there might be a
problem with their e-tickets. But it
                was more serious than that, as they found out a few
minutes later when one of the airline
                employees told them, "You both turned up on the FBI No
Fly list, and we've called the
                San Francisco police. They are coming over to talk to
you. In the meantime, one of us
                has to stay with you, so please come along with your
baggage," Gordon recalls.
                Gordon says the woman from the airlines seemed
bewildered. "We were standing there
                in the middle of the airport, and I'm sure she's
thinking these are just garden-variety
                middle-aged white dykes," Gordon says.
                "I can't imagine why this is happening," the airline
employee said, according to Gordon.
                "And I said, 'Well, I can tell you why. We work on a
paper that opposes the war on
                terrorism.' Her eyes got kind of big, and she said,
'Oh.' "
                Gordon says three uniformed members of the police then
came, took their IDs, and
                called headquarters. They wouldn't let her even get a
drink of water.
                "After ten or fifteen more minutes, one of the officers
told us, 'You aren't on the master
                list,' and they handed us back to the airline, Gordon
                But the airline was still suspicious, and circled a big
S on their boarding passes. "I assume
                it means search, and then a red S was put on it," Gordon
adds. "In fact, at the gate we
                were selected for search and they did the usual search
procedure, the wanding and the
                shoes.
                Before I got on, I asked the ticket agent if this is
going to happen every time. She said, 'I
                don't know, but I'd recommend that you get to the
airport early.' "
                For its part, the San Francisco police has little
                "We had no report of any of our officers stopping them,"
says Larry Ratti, a
                spokesperson for the police at the airport.
                "Whenever anyone comes up on the No Fly list, we come
out in one or two minutes and
                the situation is cleared up. Generally, they would make
a police report if they detained
                people for any length of time."
                Ratti says the department gets calls about suspicious
people at the airport "maybe one a
                day, one every two days." Some of these calls come from
the No Fly list, "but we don't
                differentiate," he says. "It's just a
suspicious-type-person call."
                I ask Gordon what conclusion she draws from this
                "This is harassment," she says. "It's to let us know
that they've got their eye on us."
                Adams agrees. "Nothing felt very threatening in the
episode--except that they are doing
                it," she says. Adams adds that she was singled out for
searching on her return trip from
                Boston, as well.

File-swapping 'Madster' must track songs
                Friday, November 1, 2002 Posted: 10:03 AM EST (1503 GMT)
                ALBANY, New York (AP) -- The
                file-sharing service Madster must
                keep a list of songs available through
                the system as part of a court order to
                block access to copyright works.
                U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen in
                Chicago granted a preliminary injunction
                against the service Sept. 4. The judge
                sided with recording company officials
                who claimed Albany-based Madster
                violated copyright law just as Napster
                had before it.
                Aspen waited until this week, however,
                to release terms of the injunction to give
                the two sides time to suggest wording tailored to stop
only the transfer of
                copyright files.
                In addition to disabling access to copyright works,
Aspen directed Madster to
                monitor its system and keep a list of "any and all sound
recordings and musical
                compositions" being made available. That list must be
shared with recording
                companies upon five business days notice.
                Service must comply
                The service also must file regular reports detailing its
                Madster founder Johnny Deep did not immediately return
calls Thursday. He has
                said that he didn't know of a way to filter copyright
files because the transferred
                material is encrypted.

Officials attempt to get inside
                      cells of al Qaeda in U.S.
                      By Richard Sale
                      UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
                           Local and federal law-enforcement agencies
                      attempting to infiltrate al Qaeda sleeper cells
operating in the
                      United States and are using disinformation
campaigns to
                      expose and neutralize the terror groups that
continue to
                      communicate with one another, U.S. intelligence
officials say.
                           FBI officials say recent
                      electronic intercepts of
                      communications between some al
                      Qaeda groups show that they are
                      "talking to each other."
                           "The cells are up and active,"
                      an FBI official said of the groups
                      believed to be embedded in most
                      U.S. cities with sizable Islamic
                      communities, such as New York,
                      Detroit and Los Angeles.
                           In a review of ongoing U.S.
                      operations, United Press
                      International was briefed on the al
                      Qaeda investigations by several
                      current and former intelligence
                      officers, all of whom asked not to be identified
by name.
                           Former CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency
officials say
                      the terrorists choose run-down neighborhoods
because "in a
                      place like that, you are invisible. People don't
care about you;
                      they don't want to look at you and don't look at
you," as one
                      put it.
                           A former senior U.S. intelligence official
explained: "The
                      members of cells don't think of themselves as
raiding parties
                      but as the front end of an invasion."
                           "If they can attack, blow things up and
disrupt society,
                      they believe there will be mass defections to
Islam and
                      society will collapse. They can then set up an
Islamic state."
                           The cells, these sources said, are made up of
                      Muslims and immigrants from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the
                      Persian Gulf states, and number in the thousands.
Most are
                      thought to have entered the country some time ago
and are
                      deeply entrenched in their communities.
                           To root them out, the FBI has been busy
developing a
                      network of informers in Muslim neighborhoods,
                      nightclub owners, waiters and merchants, a federal
                      law-enforcement official said.
                           Intelligence is the chief tool in the war on
terror, a senior
                      former Pentagon intelligence official said.
                           "Intelligence is really just a giant research
operation where
                      you rely on huge archival files," he said. "It's
the most
                      effective weapon you've got."
                           The next and best weapon in the war against
the cells is
                      infiltration. A longtime covert operations
specialist said law
                      enforcement is using agents who are Arabs and
fluent in
                      Arabic, who then look for ways to get inside the
                      where the cell members worship.
                           Their next goal is "to find out about the
social structure:
                      Where do they worship, where do they entertain,
what do
                      they talk about?" he said.
                           If it is known where they socialize and there
is probable
                      cause, local police might be able to place
                      devices on the premises, he said. The goal is to
identify and
                      eliminate leaders, a former CIA official said.
                           As the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies
                      knowledge, any rivalries among group members can
                      exploited, using disinformation to convince some
                      members that others are informers or traitors.
                           One FBI official explained that the purpose
is to "disrupt"
                      hostile organizations, and that FBI tactics go
back to 1956,
                      when the FBI established its Cointelpro
                      program.) This official said the program pitted
one group 
                      or even members of a single group  against
another "like
                      gladiators in ancient Rome."
                           The program has been used successfully
against such
                      groups as the Black Panthers and the Ku Klux Klan,
he said

                 Channel Six News has learned former UN Weapons
Inspector and Delmar resident Scott
                 Ritter was arrested during an Internet sex sting
operation.  But it turns out police caught
                 Ritter months before, but declined to press charges.
Sources tell us Ritter tried to meet a
                 14 year-old girl he chatted with online.  He was
instead met by police officers, who let him
                 go.  Ritter was arrested in June of 2001 for allegedly
trying to lure a 16 year-old girl he met
                 online to a Burger King.  But that girl was really an
undercover cop- surfing the web as part
                 of a police sting operation.  Ritter was charged with
attempted endangerment of a child.
                 But the charge was dismissed and the case sealed.  That
means, essentially, that it never
                 happened.  Ritter searched Iraq for weapons in the
years following the Gulf War.  More
                 recently, he's been speaking out against President

                    BEHIND THE WHEEL
                    A Key Witness at Crash Scenes: the Black Box
                      Helping investigators reconstruct accidents, data
recorders are not just for jets anymore. But their use has
                    raised privacy concerns.
Most other car makers also use this technology. But GM, and now Ford
Motor Co., decided to allow others
                    access to the data. In 2000, Santa Barbara-based
Vetronix Corp. began selling a data-retrieval system that
                    enables insurance and accident investigators to
download data recorder information. The California Highway
                    Patrol and 10 other law enforcement departments in
the state have the retrieval systems, which cost about
                    $2,500.
Jon Cherney, an Irvine police investigator, used data recorder
information to
                    catch a Rancho Palos Verdes man in a recent
hit-and-run collision. Although the man had denied being
                    involved in the accident, Cherney said the recorder
from his impounded car showed it had been in an
                    accident in the same time period. The case is
pending, he said.
Recently, a consumer variant of the black box has become available. The
device, marketed to parents of
                    teens, emits beeps and other noises when a driver
exceeds 70 mph, takes a turn too quickly or doesn't wear
                    a seat belt. Devices installed by car makers don't
record such regular driving details.
                    Who actually owns the data recorder information is a
central question in the debate over whether it
                    represents an invasion of drivers' privacy.
                    "Your car effectively spies on you," said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
                    Information Center, a civil liberties group based in

Evidence Barred in Ex-O.C. Judge's Child-Porn Case
Writings and photos were illegally obtained from Ronald Kline's
computer, court rules.
By Christine Hanley, Times Staff Writer
A federal judge on Tuesday threw out most of the key evidence in a
child pornography case against a former Orange County judge, ruling that
sexually explicit diary entries and photos were discovered after illegal
searches by a Canadian hacker who was working for police.
The ruling could undermine much of the case against Ronald C. Kline,
arrest drew national attention and ultimately resulted in the judge
dropping his bid
for reelection.
U.S. District Judge
Consuelo B. Marshall in
Los Angeles found that
Kline's 4th Amendment
privacy rights were
violated when Bradley
Willman of Langley,
British Columbia, invaded
his home computer with
a so-called Trojan Horse
In a 12-page decision,
Marshall suppressed all
the evidence seized from
Kline's home and his
home computer, including excerpts from a
computer diary about his sexual desires and more
than 1,500 pornographic photos of young boys.
"The Court finds that Bradley Willman was a government agent at the time
of the intrusion, that Willman
thought of himself as an agent for law enforcement, and that Willman's
motivation was to act for law
enforcement purposes," Marshall wrote.
Willman, the judge ruled, was acting as a tool for police and  as with
any law enforcement agent 
would be barred from seizing any personal property without a search
Marshall left open the question of whether material seized from Kline's
courthouse computer will be allowed,
asking both sides to return Sept. 15 to discuss that matter.

Man Is Accused of Hijacking Web Site

interception of an electronic

                    Impersonating an employee of the Arab television

changing a password that
                    enabled him to commandeer the Al Jazeera site,
according to a criminal complaint.
                    Racine was accused of intercepting about 300 e-mail
messages intended for Al
                    Jazeera before the takeover was discovered during
the height of the war in
                    March.

channel based in Qatar, has been

because of its airing of
                    videotaped pronouncements from fugitive Al Qaeda
                    Al Jazeera is backed by the government of Qatar but
is widely perceived as

Appeals Court Dismisses Ohio Man's Guilty Plea in Obscenity Case
Involving Fictitious Stories
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A state appeals court on Thursday dismissed the
guilty plea of a man imprisoned for writing fictitious stories of child
torture and molestation.
Lawyers specializing in the First Amendment believe Brian Dalton was the
first person in the United States successfully prosecuted for child
pornography that involved fictional writings, not images.
The 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals in Columbus ruled that Dalton
received ineffective legal assistance. Dalton had argued that his former
lawyer didn't inform him of the legal implications of a guilty plea or
ask for an immediate dismissal on First Amendment grounds.
The 3-0 ruling sends the case back to Franklin County Common Pleas
Court. Dalton could still be tried but prosecutors have not said whether
they would seek to do so.
Ray Vasvari, the American Civil Liberties Union's state legal director
in Cleveland, called the decision an "important recognition for not only
freedom of speech but freedom of thought."
Dalton, 24, of Columbus, pleaded guilty in July 2001 to pandering
obscenity involving a minor, which falls under Ohio's pornography law.
He later asked to withdraw the plea so he could challenge the
constitutionality of the law, but Franklin County Common Pleas Judge
Nodine Miller refused. ACLU attorneys then appealed.
Miller had sentenced Dalton to seven years, plus 4 1/2 years from a 1998
child pornography conviction on the grounds he violated probation by
possessing the journal.
The 14-page journal contained stories about three children - ages 10 and
11 - being caged in a basement, molested and tortured. Prosecutors
acknowledged the stories were pure fiction.
The journal was found by Dalton's probation officer during a routine
search of his home.
Dalton was charged under Ohio's 1989 child porn law, which bans
possession of obscene material involving children. He was not charged
under Ohio's obscenity law, which requires dissemination and not just
The appeals court found that Dalton's defense attorney, Isabella Dixon,
misunderstood the two charges against her client.
Both charges were based on the journal and involved fictitious events,
the court found. Dixon, it said, had erroneously believed one of the
charges was based on a letter Dalton wrote describing sexual molestation
of a young cousin, a real person.
"This misunderstanding was significant because of the important
differences in the constitutional protections afforded the private
possession of pornographic depictions of real children and similar
depictions of fictional children," Judge William Klatt said, writing for
the majority.
A message was left with Dixon seeking comment.

Studios Stage Fight Against Internet Bill
                    By Jon Healey, Times Staff Writer
                    The Hollywood studios are fighting a

                    Because it would apply to lawsuits in state courts,
the bill

Again, unless you know something about the distribution

will disperse your input randomly, regardless of its clustering.
So pick a crypto-like hash function

and use it.  You can't do better unless
you "cheat" and know your input before
you pick a hash function.  And picking pathological

If you cut vinyl (or metal) through a signal chain that didn't

Not at all.  Much like gambling, sometimes you win "randomly"
if you stop playing after that.  "Random" is a word that means
"ignorance" and both you and the insurer are ignorant about
your true lifespan.  You only play the life-insurance game once :-)

BTW One could argue that driver's insurance is *more* necessary
than medical insurance, because to exist daily you need to drive.
But again, need and slaves.
Some pay cash.  You can do without car insurance if you post a bond.
Others depend on *voluntary* charity --though nowadays this competes
with compulsory (taxed) welfare.
You forget that if the insurer bets wrong, they have to pay up and cash
in their investments.  For certain investments, premature withdrawl
costs more
than sitting on the cash.  Otherwise, like banks, or landlords with
or other putatively free agents, insurers are free to do with their
funds as they please.
So long as they hold up their end of the contracts they've entered.
FWIW, the rock climber's choice of ancestors (!) has more to do with

The flip side of Tim's comment is that you can pay extra for things you
are at risk for.  In a truly free market, insurers would offer packages
customized to your risk.  Genomic tendancy towards X?  Pay more,
get more ---including max payout.  Little tendancy towards Y?  Pay
less.  Rational people follow Pascal --you include probability in your

Males can always keep any maternal gene going, even if its

banning somatic or germ line fixes to diseases, if you can do them,
is as compassionate as banning insulin.  Which isn't even a fix, just
a workaround.
If a germ line fix has an unintended side effect, you either undo it
(revert back to being inclined towards diabetes, if this is preferable
to the side effect, say) or you debug or patch it.  Current & historical
medicine is filled with such things for mere *temporary* meds that

One could design software such that only the least required is decrypted

after you offed the power.  There would probably be a serious

Studios Stage Fight Against Internet Bill
                    By Jon Healey, Times Staff Writer
                    The Hollywood studios are fighting a
                    battle in Sacramento to derail a bill they say would
                    promote online piracy  though the bill has little
to do
                    with downloading movies.
                    Actually, the fight may have more to do with who's
                    behind the legislation: the Electronic Frontier

                    Because it would apply to lawsuits in state courts,
the bill
                    wouldn't affect people accused of pirating movies or

Pentagon Abandons Terrorism Betting Plan

                                      Add White House - AP Cabinet &
State to My Yahoo!
                     By KEN GUGGENHEIM, Associated Press Writer
                     WASHINGTON - The Pentagon (news - web sites) will
abandon a plan to
                     establish a futures market to help predict
terrorist strikes, the chairman of the
                     Senate Armed Services Committee (news - web sites)
said Tuesday.
                      Sen. John Warner (news, bio, voting record),
R-Va., said he spoke by phone
                      with the program's director, "and we mutually
agreed that this thing should be
                     stopped."
                     Warner announced the decision not long after Senate
Democratic Leader
                     Thomas Daschle took to the floor to denounce the
program as "an incentive
                     actually to commit acts of terrorism."
                     Warner made the announcement during a confirmation
hearing for retired Gen.
                     Peter J. Schoomaker, nominated to be Army chief of
                     "This is just wrong," declared Daschle, D-S.D.
                     Warner said he consulted with Senate Intelligence
Committee Chairman Pat
                     Roberts, R-Kansas, and Appropriations Committee
chairman Sen. Ted Stevens
                     (news, bio, voting record), R-Alaska, and they
agreed "that this should be
                     immediately disestablished."
                     He said they would recommend that the Pentagon not
spend any funds already
                     in place for the program and said they would pull
the plug on it during
                     House-Senate budget conference committee
negotiations later on this year.
                     The little-publicized Pentagon plan envisioned a
potential futures trading market
                     in which speculators would wager on the Internet on
the likelihood of a future
                     terrorist attack or assassination attempt on a
particular leader. A Web site
                     promoting the plan already is available.
                     When the plan was disclosed by two Democratic
senators Monday, the
                     Pentagon defended it as a way to gain intelligence
about potential terrorists'
                     plans.
                     Earlier, Warner had said that his staff was looking
into the program and would
                     report on it later Tuesday. Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton (news - web sites),
                     D-N.Y., said she was appalled to hear of plans to
set up "a futures market in

                     Other Democrats expressed similar alarm.
                     "The idea of a federal betting parlor on atrocities
and terrorism is ridiculous and
                     it's grotesque," said Sen. Ron Wyden (news, bio,
voting record), D-Ore., one of
                     two lawmakers who disclosed the plan Monday.
                     The program is called the Policy Analysis Market.
The Pentagon office
                     overseeing it, the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, or DARPA, said
                     it was part of a research effort "to investigate
the broadest possible set of new
                     ways to prevent terrorist attacks."
                     Traders would buy and sell futures contracts  just
like energy traders do now in
                     betting on the future price of oil. But the
contracts in this case would be based on
                     what might happen in the Middle East in terms of
economics, civil and military
                     affairs or specific events, such as terrorist
                     Holders of a futures contract that came true would
collect the proceeds of traders
                     who put money into the market but predicted wrong.
                     A graphic on the market's Web page Monday showed
hypothetical futures
                     contracts in which investors could trade on the
likelihood that Palestinian leader
                     Yasser Arafat (news - web sites) would be
assassinated or Jordanian King
                     Abdullah II would be overthrown. Although the Web
site described the Policy
                     Analysis Market as Middle East market, the graphic
also included the possibility
                     of a North Korea (news - web sites) missile attack.
                     That graphic apparently was removed from the Web
site hours after the news
                     conference in which Wyden and fellow Democratic
Sen. Byron Dorgan (news,
                     bio, voting record) of North Dakota criticized the
                      Dorgan described the market as "unbelievably
                     "Can you imagine if another country set up a
betting parlor so that people could
                     go in ... and bet on the assassination of an
American political figure or the
                     overthrow of this institution or that institution?"
he said.
                     But in its statement Monday, DARPA said markets
could reveal "dispersed and
                     even hidden information. Futures markets have
proven themselves to be good at
                     predicting such things as elections results; they
are often better than expert
                     opinions."
                     According to its Web site, the Policy Analysis
Market would be a joint program of
                     DARPA and two private companies, Net Exchange, a
market technologies
                     company, and the Economist Intelligence Unit, the
business information arm of
                     the publisher of The Economist magazine.
                     DARPA has been criticized by Congress for its
Terrorism Information Awareness
                     program, a computerized surveillance program that
has raised privacy concerns.
                     Wyden said the Policy Analysis Market is under the
supervision of retired Adm.
                     John Poindexter, the head of the Terrorism
Information Awareness program and,
                     in the 1980s, national security adviser to
President Reagan.
                     The Web site does not address how much money
investors would be likely to
                     put into the market but says analysts would be
motivated by the "prospect of
                     profit and at pain of loss" to make accurate
                     Trading is to begin Oct. 1. The market would
initially be limited to 1,000 traders,
                     increasing to at least 10,000 by Jan. 1.
                     The Web site says government agencies will not be
allowed to participate and
                     will not have access to the identities or funds of
                     The market is a project of a DARPA division called
FutureMAP, or "Futures
                     Markets Applied to Prediction."
                     "The rapid reaction of markets to knowledge held by
only a few participants may
                     provide an early warning system to avoid surprise,"
the FutureMap Web site said.
                     Dorgan and Wyden released a letter to Poindexter
calling for an end to the
                     program. They noted a May 20 report to lawmakers
that cited the possibility of
                     using market forces to predict whether Israel will
be attacked with biological
                     weapons.
                     "Surely such a threat should be met with
intelligence gathering of the highest
                     quality  not by putting the question to
individuals betting on an Internet Web
                     site," they said.
                     Wyden said $600,000 has been spent on the program
so far and the Pentagon
                     plans to spend an additional $149,000 this year.
The Pentagon has requested
                     $3 million for the program for next year and $5
million for the following year.
                     Wyden said the Senate version of next year's
defense spending bill would cut off
                     money for the program, but the House version would
fund it. The two versions
                     will have to be reconciled.

This objection jammed in my memegrinder so I had to examine it.
I'll argue that the nastiness of many human diseases are *temporary*
to the "evolved pathogens don't kill" observation.  Because humans are
not in equilibrium:
* Human population is growing.  This means you can kill your host, two
ones are born every minute (except in a few places, eg W. Europe).   If
your host population
is growing like that, you can be extra lethal, temporarily.
If the host numbers are stable, you could wipe them all out if you're
too lethal.
* Humans are expanding their range.  This means new diseases are
introduced from existing
resivoirs so they have not adapted to humans --especially the conditions
of modern
humans-- yet.  Ebola, HIV, etc.
* Humans only *recently* live in dense (and stationary) groups.  This
means that pathogens have not adapted yet.  Cities are incubators.
Bubonic plague, TB are good examples here.
* Rapid travel is even more recent an invention.
Populations who have never seen a pathogen (West nile,
etc.) are getting exposed for the first time.  No equilibrium there.
The "Cortez" effect, amplified by Whittle's jet engine.
"Globalization" means everyone gets exposed to everyone
else's pathogens.  A sick chinese chicken can ruin your day
in America.  Guns, germs, and steel.
BTW Globalization also means that everyone gets exposed to everyone's
plants, insects, etc.  A lot of isolated species (e.g., Hawaii) that
can't deal
with competition will be toast just as much as the Amerinds who
met Mr. Cortez.  Guns, germs, and steel.  Meet Mr. Kudzu.
Obviously, the scale of "temporary" should be taken in the
larger context, not that of one's own lifespan.
Of course a coadapted pathogen (eg flu) can spontaneously become newly
simply because of mutation or recombination.  If the hosts aren't all
then merely one particular host-group dies, along with the newly
virulent strain.
Losing some village is not a big deal (until someone gets on a plane).
Interesting to extend the analogy to say virii that zap cellphones or
PCs permenantly
vs. merely being annoyances.  A PC-zapping virus would give Macs the
kind of
ripe open field not seen since the days of the Bering Strait.  Also
interesting to

There could still be some protection with some crypto schemes, in such

the adversary's algorithmicists (who can be rented cheaply when young)
hope that much faster algorithms can be found, if not published :-)
You really want the assurance of exponential work to break it, not just
big constants.
The problem is that, for public key crypto, we want functions which are
easy "one way" (if you know the secret) and exponentionally tough in the
length of the public key the other.  If there is a "quick"
(*non-expon*.) solution
to your trap-door function then the adversary can reasonably do the
extra work and
your scheme is toast.
For symmetric crypto, the same applies.  You can always make *your* key
longer, but the "leverage" you get --the extra work the adversary must
is much less if you can't demand exponential work by them (because as
was suggested, presumably tongue-in-cheek, by EC, there might not be
any exponential work problems)

Ex-Judge May Testify in O.C. Porn Case
 Testimony by Ronald C. Kline could affect ruling to admit evidence
found on workplace computer.
By Christine Hanley, Times Staff Writer
Former Orange County Judge Ronald C. Kline may be called to the witness
stand to explain why he didn't realize his courthouse computer could be
searched for child pornography  especially since he helped draft the
rules for such searches.
Kline is expected to be asked Monday to explain his role on the Orange
County Superior Court's Technology Committee, which developed the policy
that warned judges and court staff that their computers were not their
property and could be searched.
The hearing could prove pivotal as prosecutors try to salvage a child
pornography case that has all but collapsed since Kline was arrested.
The case has drawn national attention, particularly as Kline waged a
reelection campaign while facing the charges. He later quit the race and
gave up his seat on the bench. Judge Consuelo B. Marshall has already
tossed out evidence  including diary entries about his sexual desires
and more than 1,500 pornographic images of young boys  that support six
of the seven charges. In her decision earlier this summer, she ruled
that Kline's right to privacy was violated by a Canadian man who was
working for police when he hacked into the computers used by Kline at
home and at work.
Prosecutors are appealing that decision, but first Marshall must rule on
whether to suppress the handful of e-mails, pornographic images and
diary entries allegedly found on Kline's courthouse computer. Those
items support a single count of possessing child pornography  the lone
criminal charge facing Kline.
Kline's attorneys argue that the government's attempt to save the
evidence collected on his work computer is misleading. The question of
whether Kline knew about the policy is moot, they say, because his
computer wouldn't have been searched without the information provided by
the Canadian hacker.
"The chambers computer search was the fruit of the primary illegality;
as such, it must be suppressed," said lead defense attorney Paul S.
But prosecutors contend police did not need a search warrant to inspect
Kline's computer. They argue the court's own policy warned judicial
officers and other staffers that their computers were not their property
and could be monitored for questionable activity at any time.
The eight-page policy warns computer users that access to sexually
explicit and other offensive information is strictly prohibited and that
"e-mail, Internet access and personal computers are provided for
business use and not a public forum, and as such does not provide for
First Amendment Freedom of Speech guarantees."
At the same time, it also states that management may be required "based
on a subpoena" to release computer files to law enforcement agencies in
a criminal investigation.
Prosecutors have filed a copy of the policy, as well as declarations
from Richard Droll, the chief technology officer of Orange County
Superior Court since 1993, and Kathleen E. O'Leary, an associate justice
of California's 4th Appellate District.
Droll confirms that Kline was on the Technology Committee and attended
meetings in 1996 when the policy was drafted and later when it was
O'Leary, who was presiding judge of the Orange County court system when
the policy was imposed, sent a memo to the staff on Oct. 13, 1998, which
was distributed via e-mail and to office mailboxes.
One of her intents, she said, was to remind staffers that "management

Licenses as IDs at airports questioned
WASHINGTON  Federal officials and lawmakers raised serious concerns
Tuesday about the continued use of driver's licenses at airports and
U.S. borders in light of California's new law allowing illegal
immigrants to obtain the widely accepted means of identification.
"If driver's licenses are given to people who are illegally in the
country, then that puts extra burdens and difficulties on our inspectors
at the border," Hutchinson said. "If you don't have integrity in the
driver's licenses that are issued, then it really undermines the whole
premise of allowing U.S. citizens to travel abroad and come back with
limited proof of U.S. citizenship, without a passport."
The wisdom of using driver's licenses for identification was also
questioned Tuesday in a congressional watchdog report that found that
fraudulent licenses are passing muster at airports, border crossings and
motor-vehicle offices. The full report by the General Accounting Office
has been classified for security reasons. But in public testimony
prepared for the Senate Finance Committee, Robert Cramer, director of
GAO's office of special investigations, warned about relying on driver's
licenses for identification.
Davis had refused to sign such a law before, citing homeland security
concerns. His about-face was questioned by some as a move to garner
support in the Latino community.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 22  California today adopted the nation's first law
meant to protect the privacy of drivers whose cars are equipped with
"black boxes," or data recorders that can be used to gather vital
information on how a vehicle is being driven in the last seconds before
a crash.
Gov. Gray Davis signed the law, which takes effect on July 1, requiring
carmakers to disclose the existence of such devices and forbidding
access to the data without either a court order or the owner's
permission, unless it is for a safety study in which the information
cannot be traced back to the car.
More than 25 million cars and trucks have the boxes that measure speed,
air-bag deployment and the use of brakes, seat belts and turn signals.
But California's privacy law is the first of its kind, says Thomas M.
Kowalick, co-chairman of a committee convened by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers to set standards for the boxes.
Most of the recorders are on General Motors vehicles, but Ford and

The Subpoenas are Coming!
By Mark Rasch Sep 29 2003 05:00AM PT
Frequent readers of this space know that I am no apologist for hackers
Adrian Lamo, who, in the guise of protection, access others' computer
systems without authorization, and then publicize these vulnerabilities.
When Lamo did this to the New York Times, he violated two of my cardinal
rules: Don't make enemies with people appointed for life by the
of the United States; and don't make enemies of people who buy their ink
the gallon.
Now, in the scope of prosecuting Lamo, the FBI is doing the hacker one
better by violating both of these precepts in one fell swoop.
The Bureau recently sent letters to a handful of reporters who have
stories about the Lamo case -- whether or not they have actually
interviewed Lamo. The letters warn them to expect subpoenas for all
documents relating to the hacker, including, apparently, their own
e-mails, impressions, interviews with third parties, independent
investigations, privileged conversations and communications, off the
statements, and expense and travel reports related to stories about
In short, everything.
The notices make no mention of the protections of the First Amendment,

them under provisions amended by the USA-PATRIOT Act.
The FBI doesn't want the reporters talking to anyone, because that would
supposedly harm the ongoing criminal investigation.
The government also officiously informed the reporters that this is an
"official criminal investigation" and asks that they not disclose the
request to preserve documents, or the contents of the letter, to anyone
presumably including their editors, directors, or lawyers -- under the
implied threat of prosecution for obstruction of justice.
That's why you're reading about the letters for the first time here.
They do this despite the fact that, had they actually obtained and
issued a
subpoena for these documents, the federal criminal procedure rules would
have prohibited the imposition of any obligation of secrecy unless the
Justice Department obtained a "gag" order on the press -- a rare event
All of this began the day after the Attorney General advised all United
States Attorney's Offices to prosecute each and every criminal offense
the harshest possible penalties, instead of the previous policy of
prosecuting cases with the penalties that most accurately reflect the

government may be seeking to throw the book at you!

The demand that journalists preserve their notes is being made under
that require ISP's and other "providers of electronic communications
services" to preserve, for example, e-mails stored on their service,
pending a subpoena, under a statute modified by the USA-PATRIOT Act.
The purpose of that law was to prevent the inadvertent destruction of
ephemeral electronic records pending a subpoena. For example, you could
tell an ISP that you were investigating a hacking case, and that they
should preserve the audit logs while you ran to the local magistrate for

Computer hunt for terrorists
October 2, 2003
By Charles Piller and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Times Staff Writers
A secret computer program detected something suspicious about the
middle-aged passenger heading to Eugene, Ore.
He traveled often, usually taking one-way flights on short notice. In
the months following the Sept. 11 attacks, every time he tried to board
a flight in Portland, he was pulled out of line and searched as a
possible terrorist threat.
The passenger was Peter A. DeFazio  congressman from Oregon, former Air
Force officer and ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee overseeing
airline security.
"My constituents found it very amusing," DeFazio said.
It soon became less humorous when he learned he could stop triggering
the security checks by simply joining a frequent flier program, a trick
that in the computer's mind transformed him from a suspect into a
trusted customer.
"A terrorist can't figure that out?" DeFazio asked.
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, creating an effective system to screen out
both known terrorists and would-be hijackers  plotters with spotless
records but nefarious intent  from millions of airline passengers has
become a top priority in the war against terrorism.
But as DeFazio's experience showed, even the most elaborate current
computer systems stumble when trying to decipher human motivations, and,
like any security scheme, have been perpetually vulnerable to being
In the face of such challenges, the federal government has embarked on a
costly program to create a second-generation profiling system designed
to verify the identity of every passenger and analyze their lives
through a "black box" of government intelligence and law enforcement
databases. Though details of the system are secret, security experts
believe that more than 100 factors will be used to sniff out terrorists
based on telephone records, travel patterns, law enforcement files and
other sources.
The system will turn the new federal Transportation Security
Administration into one of the most intrusive government agencies,
perhaps second only to the Internal Revenue Service  investigating
about 70 million passengers who take 675 million trips by air annually.
And possibly, all for an illusion of security.
"The U.S. is so much oriented toward a technology [solution] that the
people are serving the technology," said Offer Einav, former director of
security for Israel's national airline, El Al, widely considered the
world's most secure carrier. Like other aviation security experts, he
views computer profiling as beneficial only if paired with seasoned
security officials who exercise common sense and conduct their own
psychological assessments of passengers  not part of the U.S. program.
"They are dealing with enemies who are human beings. Human beings will
always beat the technology," Einav said.
Mixed Success
No computer-based system has ever verifiably thwarted a hijacking or
bombing, according to federal and private security experts. But given
the enormousness of the task, the airline industry's current system 
the Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening system, or CAPPS  has
occasionally shown flashes of brilliance.
Its greatest success may have been on Sept. 11, 2001. In the 24 hours
leading up to the hijackings, CAPPS would have checked more than 1.8
million passengers. It actually flagged six of the 19 terrorists later
involved in the hijackings, according to the national commission on the
Sept. 11 attacks. About 92,000 innocent travelers were also singled out.
Unfortunately, only a brief luggage check for explosives and weapons was
required. The hijackers  and the then-legal box cutters several were
carrying  were all welcomed aboard their flights.
CAPPS was deployed in 1998, following the crash of TWA Flight 800 off
Long Island two years earlier. It was part of a package of
anti-terrorism measures put in place  including baggage X-rays and
bomb-sniffing dogs  even though mechanical failure was later blamed for
the crash.
The system largely relies on government watch lists and passenger travel
histories. It provides a relatively rudimentary check that the industry
designed as a compromise between maintaining efficiency in boarding
passengers and finding possible terrorists, said consultant Douglas
Laird, former security director for Northwest Airlines, who helped
develop CAPPS.
Laird praised CAPPS for targeting nearly a third of the Sept. 11
hijackers. "What failed on 9/11 was the follow-up," he said.
After the events of Sept. 11 exposed CAPPS' weaknesses, the airlines and
the government tried to compensate by hedging their bets  flagging 15%
to 20% of travelers  an estimated 370,000 per day  for hand luggage
searches and extra security checks. That is an increase from 5% in 2001,
according to the TSA.
But casting such a wide net can overwhelm the system, resulting in long
delays at the airport. The government believes the best way to increase
security and efficiency is to create a more advanced computer system.
CAPPS II, an upgrade expected to cost more than $105 million, is
designed to transform a few simple database searches into an omniscient
eye on terrorism. The TSA, which will operate the system, plans to
introduce it next year. "I don't think there is a single project that
will do more potential good for aviation security," said Adm. James M.
Loy, head of the TSA. CAPPS II will have "an astonishing capability" to
trace would-be terrorists, even if they lead apparently unremarkable
lives, he added.
In addition to checking travel records, CAPPS II would require each
passenger to provide his name, birth date, home address and phone number
when making a reservation. Commercial database companies would check the
information against billions of public records and issue an identity
rating, handicapping the likelihood that the passenger is lying and
judging how "rooted" the person is in a community, rating such factors
as local family connections and the amount of time in the same home.
The government would then check the information against national
security and law enforcement watch lists of more than 100,000 suspects.
It would mine CIA, FBI and other intelligence databases to pluck the
rare unknown terrorist from an ocean of innocents with a kind of
technological mind-reading.
The government estimates that no more than 4% of passengers  about
74,000 people a day  would be rated "unknown risk/yellow light" by
CAPPS II and get closer screening, such as shoe checks and physical
searches of carry-on items.
An average of only one or two people per day would be rated "high
risk/red light" and be barred from flying or even arrested.
Those are the theoretical projections. Reality could be far different.
"Systems that involve wholesale surveillance of innocents tend not to
work," said Bruce Schneier, a leading cryptographer and chief technical
officer of Counterpane Internet Security, a cyber-security firm. "It's
not feasible to catch the bad guys without also catching too many good
Innocent Victim
Consider the experience of Joe Adams of Cottage Grove, Minn., an
unassuming, 71-year-old scholar of British literature, who travels for
pleasure and his part-time job grading college entrance exams.
Adams was flagged by CAPPS more than a dozen times between April 2002
and this August. At first he was perplexed, then frustrated and finally
angered at being treated like a national security threat for up to two
hours every time he flew.
Adams eventually learned the reason: His name, like hundreds of other
Joe Adamses nationwide, resembled an alias of an alleged Al Qaeda
"I appreciate what they are trying to do security-wise," Adams said.
"What I don't appreciate is what they are trying to do to someone like
me," someone improbably old for such a mission. "I could be [a
terrorist's] grandpa."
Adams' problem eventually disappeared without explanation. Many others
simply put up with such treatment. Calls to seven random Joseph Adamses
around the country turned up five who fly regularly and share the
literature scholar's plight.
One Massachusetts grandmother of 12, whose husband is named Joseph
Adams, was told by an airport screener that she was flagged as not just
a regular security risk, but a high security risk.
By design, computer profiling systems flag millions of people for such
common reasons as moving often, visiting the Middle East or being
unlucky enough to share a name with someone on the watch list. The
result is an enormous error rate that can overwhelm screeners.
At the same time, the systems are necessarily blinded from considering
some factors. For example, ethnic, religious or racial designations are
excluded from today's CAPPS and CAPPS II to avoid discrimination.
Linking those factors to terrorism may be an application of crude
stereotypes, but from a security standpoint, barring such identifiers
doesn't make sense, Einav said.
"As far as I remember, none of the Al Qaeda members was a citizen of the
state of Switzerland or was a Catholic priest," Einav said.
"Unfortunately, cells of Al Qaeda are existing in Islamic states."
The Sept. 11 terrorists understood that a successful hijacking depended
on exploiting precisely these types of holes in the computer profiling
In the months leading up to the attacks, they tried several dry runs to
see if their efforts to remain invisible to the security system had paid
off, according to the joint House-Senate intelligence report on the
attacks, issued last December.
"Transparency is the Achilles' heel" of CAPPS, letting attackers
"reverse engineer" the system, wrote Samidh Chakrabarti and Aaron
Strauss, students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard University, whose computer science class paper raised eyebrows
in the airline industry last year.
Passengers know where they stand  whether they have been placed in a
separate line, interrogated or searched.
Chakrabarti and Strauss concluded that if a terrorist made six trial
flights and got the green light every time, that person could
confidently assume that he or she would not be stopped by the system on
a real hijack mission.
Schneier suggested an even simpler approach.
"You want a good identity? Steal it," he said. A recent report from the
Federal Trade Commission found that 27 million Americans have been
victimized by this type of fraud in the last five years.
MIT professor Arnold Barnett, a consultant to the government on aviation
safety and security issues, said no computer program is immune to such
"The belief that penetrating people's minds is the key to stopping
airline terror could be an illusion that, if taken seriously, might
someday be shattered at great cost," he wrote in an upcoming article in
the journal Risk Analysis. "In the worst-case scenario, [CAPPS II] could
be reminiscent of the Maginot line."
The TSA's Loy said his agency can foil the terrorists' efforts. "We will
be counter-gaming the gaming," he said.
One way to do that is to conduct random security checks, which flag
passengers regardless of their threat rating.
Random checks were increased after the Sept. 11 attacks, but proved
endlessly irritating to the millions of innocent travelers who resent
security guards rummaging through their underwear and other personal
effects. They have since been "radically" reduced, and would remain at
current levels under CAPPS II, Loy said.
CAPPS II would also constantly update its data and adjust its analysis
to keep terrorists off balance, Loy said.
But Stanford University computer scientist Jeffrey D. Ullman said that
building a prescient computer system capable of seeing through simple
human ruses would require an effort comparable to the Manhattan Project
during World War II to build the atomic bomb.
Short of that unlikely prospect, the other option is to engulf ever
greater amounts of data in hopes of bolstering the computer system.
Privacy Concerns
In its initial plan, the government proposed keeping CAPPS II dossiers
of air travelers on file for 50 years, but the idea was dropped after a
public outcry.
Privacy advocates still worry that, as with any large database, there is
an inevitable tendency to use the information for more and more
purposes. Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge, for example, has already
approved the use of CAPPS II to identify fugitives wanted for violent
Even before the deployment of CAPPS II, a major data-security lapse has
jolted the traveling public. JetBlue Airways Corp. admitted recently
that in a deliberate violation of its own rules, it had secretly
delivered detailed passenger data to a military contractor working on a
separate airline security project. Outraged customers have filed suit
against the company, and the Homeland Security Department has initiated
an investigation.
The TSA acknowledged that some mishaps involving accuracy and disclosure
of CAPPS II data are inevitable. The agency will have a passenger
advocate and appeals process, but has yet to spell out what rights
passengers will have. Congress has asked the General Accounting Office
to investigate if CAPPS II can identify suspicious travelers without
trampling the rights of innocents; lawmakers are awaiting the GAO's
verdict before approving deployment of the system.
"We here at the Department of Homeland Security are also citizens, and
we are also very concerned about our rights, about our privacy and about
our civil liberties," said Nuala O'Connor Kelly, the department's chief
privacy officer.
But privacy advocates say that because CAPPS II information would be
classified, travelers would never be certain why they were flagged. It's
a Catch-22 that would present enormous challenges for clearing their
names  and an enormous temptation for misuse, said David Sobel, general
counsel of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center.
"People are going to want to know, 'Why am I pulled aside every time I
take a flight?' " he said. "The answer is going to be, 'Sorry, we can't
tell you.' "

Yes, because CPUs couldn't/can't keep up with SSL's DH modexp at

Lucky, the VIA chip is for SOHO not servers.   Therefore modexp is
not a bottleneck, its a "one time" cost well performed by the
x86 in a few hundred msec.  On the other hand, the AES hardware could
a substantial relief for the CPU for VPN apps, despite its relative
ease in software compared to DES.
Remember that the modexp cores out there are generally intended
for "high end" apps like commercial-server cards.  Though their gate
count isn't too bad, they tend to require a large number of RAM
controllers and embedded RAM for the operands.  If you've got
a good fraction of a second to spend, and have a general purpose
CPU, you don't need hardware acceleration for modexp.
As I wrote previously, I'd expect to see better integrated peripheral
support (eg integrated ether or two) before I saw modexp support.

Yes it is the case.  But many of us regard State force as a *very*
different thing
than a property owner's whims.  So the State can censor, but an
merely doesn't want your bumper sticker on his car.  Individuals *can't*
censor in the 1st amend sense.  (Similarly with compelled speech.)
The State *must* treat everyone the same, but private entities are not
similarly bound.
The State must permit citizens to bear arms, but in
my saloon you leave them at the door, or don't enter.  Simple.
Entering my saloon is a private transaction.
1. Tech point: Any passive media for human consumption can NOT be
by gremlins.  ADCs handle that.  The "analog hole".
Active content (eg programs) can be though.
2. Many of us do worry about eroding conventional rights by these same
gremlins, *when they are supported by wrong law*.
E.g., I have a right in the US to lend a book.  A digital book
could make doing so a pain, but not impossible.  And again, I (as
have *no* right to compel the publisher to use a large font (if I've got
bad eyes) or make it easy to xerox.  Or backup or lend or sell.
Now, if it is simply some publisher's whim to release content protected
by gremlins, that's their decision.  *What gets our goat* is when the
uses its force eg  to make tinkering with our property illegal.
You'll need to understand that difference around here.  Many of us
(unlike many working for the State) still respect private property,
and *mutually consensual* transactions.
If you want to publish a book on paper that
prevents its xeroxing, that's fine.  Might be annoying, but its
within your rights.  But when the State says that say
scanners or image processing or figuring out how the book
is bound is illegal (DMCA), well...
A gremlin is a nuisance, a gremlin backed by the state.. indicates
that someone "needs killing", and its not the gremlin.
Again, you can publish in fonts that don't photocopy.
Its your right.  And its my right to try to get around that, to exercise
my right eg to fair use.  But it is immoral and unconstitutional for the
State to interfere with *either* of us -publisher or reader.
Because we're both choosing to enter a mutually consensual transaction,
the State has no grounds to interfere.  That's basically what freedom
is about.  It doesn't even matter if the transaction is harmful to one
or both of us; masochism (pharmaceuticals, N-ary sex between
arbitrary conspecifics, etc) should be legal.  Life liberty and the
pursuit of whatever.

similarly obligated

The parent company of DirecTV, the home satellite service, has promised
several federal agencies that it can address concerns about foreign
ownership of sensitive U.S. communications systems if it wins approval
of its proposed merger with Australian-controlled News Corp.
But the merger also has drawn the scrutiny of the Department of Homeland
Security, the FBI and Justice Department divisions in addition to the
antitrust department. The deal would bring DirecTV's five satellites and
sophisticated communications system under the control of a company based
outside the United States.
Chief among the U.S. concerns is that a foreign-owned satellite system
and communications system could be used for illegal surveillance on U.S.
citizens and facilities, according to documents passed this week among
Hughes, News Corp. and the federal government.
"As the [FCC] is aware, the DOJ, FBI and DHS have taken the position
that their ability to satisfy their obligations to protect the national
security, to enforce the laws, and to preserve the safety of the public
could be significantly impaired by transactions in which foreign
entities will own or operate a part of the U.S. communications system,
or in which foreign-located facilities will be used to provide domestic
communications services to U.S. customers," read a letter filed at the
FCC by the three law enforcement agencies last week.
The Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, a group made
up of executive departments and representatives from the State, Defense,
Treasury and Commerce departments, typically reviews transactions
involving foreign ownership of businesses that serve the United States.
In September, for instance, the committee approved the reorganization

New Cellphone Offers Big Shots Eavesdrop-Proof Call

By Lucas van Grinsven, European Technology Correspondent
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A German company launched a new mobile handset on
Tuesday targeted at business executives that secures lines are free from
eavesdroppers, sparking criticism that it could also make criminals
harder to catch.
Missed Tech Tuesday?
Find the perfect tricked-out cell phone, plus best hybrid phones and

Berlin-based Cryptophone, a unit of privately held GSMK, developed the
phone by inserting an encryption software inside a standard handheld
computer phone. This ensures that calls can only be decoded by a similar
handset or a computer running the software.
But the phone is seen as a mixed blessing in some European countries.
While the benefits for business managers exchanging sensitive
information are obvious, such a device could potentially have the side
effect of helping criminals.
Security specialists in the Netherlands said the device could threaten
criminal investigation by the Dutch police, which is one of the world's

But privacy lobbyists say the new handset is a "freedomphone" much more

Sweden's Sectra, Swiss Crypto AG and Germany's Rohde & Schwarz, it has
no ties to national security and defense organizations and that there is
no back door for government agencies.
"We allow everyone to check the security for themselves, because we're
the only ones who publish the source code," said Rop Gonggrijp at

Protest Is in the Airwaves on Eve of Bush UK Visit
Mon Nov 17,10:46 AM ET
By Bernhard Warner, European Internet Correspondent
LONDON (Reuters) - With President Bush (news - web sites) due to touch
down on British soil Tuesday, Internet message boards, mobile phones and
pagers are buzzing with the sounds of protest, and police are scrambling
to catch every word.
Since the 1999 World Trade Organization (news - web sites) riots in
Seattle, the protester's toolkit has gone noticeably high-tech,
embracing the latest Internet and mobile technologies for everything
from selling T-shirts for the cause to coordinating mass demonstrations.
Handheld gadgets, equipped with global positioning systems and Internet
access, are being used to mobilize groups quickly and catch police on
the hop.
"What you have now is the equivalent of battlefield soldiers. That's
what the technology has created," said a London-based telecommunications
security expert who advises law enforcement units.
British police have a special task force that follows how everyday
technologies are being used to plot mass demonstrations and avoid the
long arm of the law should violence break out.
Forces across Britain are preparing for anti-Bush protests this week
which are expected to attract more than 60,000 demonstrators, by combing
protest groups' Web sites and message boards for clues on their plans.
A number of anti-war organizations, including Stop the War, have been
openly detailing their plans for rallies and demonstrations. The group's
site,  is expected to reach a one-day peak of
23,000 visitors on Monday, said John Rees, a group co-founder.
The group has a small, but growing e-commerce business, selling various
items, such as "wanted" posters of Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair
(news - web sites) for one pound ($1.69) and leaflets at 1,000 for 10
Rees said the group can reach thousands of people with a single e-mail
and via mobile phone text alerts. "With new technology, we've moved with
the times, not necessarily ahead of the times," he said.
The bigger concern for police are groups that operate underground. Some
use sophisticated encryption techniques favored by the military to
disguise the content of e-mail messages and Internet postings, the
security expert said.
But it is the sophistication of hand-held devices that have police on
the look-out.
Internet-enabled phones and gadgets are capable of sending and receiving
elaborate messages detailing meeting locations, maps and last-minute
instructions to fellow protesters in the streets.
The widespread use of picture phones is also a concern as the could be
used to capture images of the police officers.
"Some of these guys run counter-intelligence. They want to know who the
cops are. With a mobile phone that's equipped with a camera you could
start your own database of cops," he said. ($1=.5919 Pound)

A Baggage Lock for You and the Federal Screeners
By JOE SHARKEY
Published: November 11, 2003
AIRLINE passengers will be able to lock checked bags confidently again
starting tomorrow, thanks to a new customer-service initiative between
private enterprise and the Transportation Security Administration.
Here's how the plan will work: Several major luggage and lock retailers
the United States will announce tomorrow the availability of new locks,
made by various manufacturers, that T.S.A. inspectors will be able to
readily identify and open on checked bags selected for hand searches at
T.S.A. screeners in airports around the country have already been
in using secure procedures to open the new certified locks when
and relock them after inspecting bags.
"Literally since we began the process of screening every checked bag for
explosives in December, one of the challenges has been the ability to
into bags without doing damage to them," said Brian Turmail, a spokesman
for the T.S.A.
The system, developed in cooperation with the T.S.A. and the Travel
Association, a trade group, was designed around "a common set of
that any company that manufactures, or is interested in manufacturing,
luggage or luggage locks could follow that would allow T.S.A. screeners
open the bag without doing damage to the bag, in a manner that would
the bag to stay secured afterwards,'' Mr. Turmail said. "In other words,
can open it, but no one else can."
The locks will be available in various manufacturers' designs. All will
geared around a uniform technology allowing them to be opened by T.S.A.
inspectors using a combination of secure codes and special tools,
to John W. Vermilye, a former airline baggage-systems executive who
developed the system through Travel Sentry, a company he set up for that
All the locks will carry a red diamond-shaped logo to certify to
that they meet the Travel Sentry standards. Mr. Vermilye said his
would receive royalties from manufacturers.
The system will ensure that passengers using the locks will not have to
worry about a lock being broken or a locked bag being damaged if it is
selected for hand inspection. It will also mean more peace of mind for
passengers worried about reports of increased pilferage from unlocked
"The general feeling of airline passengers is, 'I don't like to have to
keep my bags unlocked,' " added Mr. Vermilye, who once worked as a
handler. "As somebody in the business for 30 years, I don't like it
because I know what goes on" in some baggage-handling areas, he said.
An industry study showed that 90 percent of air travelers are now
checked bags unlocked, whereas before this year about 66 percent of them
said they always locked their bags.
"I travel all the time, and I always used to lock my bags" until this
said Michael F. Anthony, the chairman and chief executive of Brookstone,
specialty retailer with 266 shops, including 30 in airports. Besides the
worry about theft within the airline baggage-handling systems, Mr.
said he was concerned on business trips about unlocked bags in the hands
cab and airport shuttle drivers, bellhops and others.
Brookstone airport shops are planning to introduce the chain's own brand
new locks with in-store promotions tomorrow, Mr. Anthony said. A package
two four-digit Brookstone combination locks costs $20. Luggage and other
accessories with the lock standards incorporated also will begin moving
soon onto shelves at Brookstone and other retailers.
Mr. Anthony said that the locks represented a needed air-travel
customer-service breakthrough, "helping people reclaim a sense of
they had in the past" with their checked possessions.
The T.S.A. mandated screening of all checked bags starting last Dec. 31.
Since then, most of the estimated 1.5 million bags checked daily in
domestic airports have been inspected by bomb-detecting machinery - but
about 10 percent of checked bags are opened and inspected by hand.
Initially, the T.S.A. planned to issue a blanket prohibition against
locking bags, but the agency ultimately decided instead to merely
that passengers not lock them. The T.S.A. public directive on the
says: "In some cases screeners will have to open your baggage as part of
the screening process. If your bag is unlocked, then T.S.A. will simply
open the bag and screen the bag. However, if the bag is locked and
needs to open your bag, then locks may have to be broken. You may keep
bag locked if you choose, but T.S.A. is not liable for damage caused to
locked bags that must be opened.''
With bags unlocked, many travelers, including business travelers who
expensive electronic gear, worried that their checked possessions were
too vulnerable to theft, passing unlocked through T.S.A. hands and into
standard airline baggage-handling systems. Reports of pilferage rose
year, as did concern about who was legally responsible for claims of
or damage, since both government and airline employees have custody of
at various points.
Mr. Vermilye is a former head of baggage operations for Eastern Airlines
who later worked as a top executive of the International Air Transport
Association, a trade group for airlines worldwide. After 9/11, he was
of a team of industry consultants working with the T.S.A. to improve
customer service.
Mr. Vermilye and Mr. Turmail at the T.S.A. agreed that the new system
probably make the screening chore easier for inspectors. "With this
they know they don't have to break a lock or damage a bag. They go,
I know I can open it.' It ceases to become an issue," Mr. Vermilye said.

You need to reconfigure your FPGAs for each algorithm.)  And if you
run through all the keys, it could always be the *last* key you try.
So although given *large sets of messages* you can say that 99% would
have been cracked "by now", this kind of stats isn't really useful.
"Close" is for hand grenades, horseshoes, and proximity fuzes; there is
no "close" in crypto.
That would cause the decrypting code to truncate significant digits
which would not permit decryption.  Suppose you did this and the
fixed the length so it would work.  This wouldn't matter: Eve would
wonder what
all those extra random bits are for.
A better approach *might* be to lie about the symmetric encryption
used.  Encrypt with AES-256, use RSA on that 256 bit key, but modify
the message to claim you've used AES-128 or 3DES.
However, this requires a secure out of band channel to communicate this
your recipient.  And if you have such a channel, you may as well give
a nonstandard S-box initialization (eg "e times your SSN number" vs.
"pi" in Blowfish) or a OTP.

Protest Is in the Airwaves on Eve of Bush UK Visit
Mon Nov 17,10:46 AM ET
By Bernhard Warner, European Internet Correspondent
LONDON (Reuters) - With President Bush (news - web sites) due to touch
down on British soil Tuesday, Internet message boards, mobile phones and
pagers are buzzing with the sounds of protest, and police are scrambling
to catch every word.
Since the 1999 World Trade Organization (news - web sites) riots in
Seattle, the protester's toolkit has gone noticeably high-tech,
embracing the latest Internet and mobile technologies for everything
from selling T-shirts for the cause to coordinating mass demonstrations.
Handheld gadgets, equipped with global positioning systems and Internet
access, are being used to mobilize groups quickly and catch police on
the hop.
"What you have now is the equivalent of battlefield soldiers. That's
what the technology has created," said a London-based telecommunications
security expert who advises law enforcement units.
British police have a special task force that follows how everyday
technologies are being used to plot mass demonstrations and avoid the
long arm of the law should violence break out.
Forces across Britain are preparing for anti-Bush protests this week
which are expected to attract more than 60,000 demonstrators, by combing
protest groups' Web sites and message boards for clues on their plans.
A number of anti-war organizations, including Stop the War, have been
openly detailing their plans for rallies and demonstrations. The group's
site,  is expected to reach a one-day peak of
23,000 visitors on Monday, said John Rees, a group co-founder.
The group has a small, but growing e-commerce business, selling various
items, such as "wanted" posters of Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair
(news - web sites) for one pound ($1.69) and leaflets at 1,000 for 10
Rees said the group can reach thousands of people with a single e-mail
and via mobile phone text alerts. "With new technology, we've moved with
the times, not necessarily ahead of the times," he said.
The bigger concern for police are groups that operate underground. Some
use sophisticated encryption techniques favored by the military to
disguise the content of e-mail messages and Internet postings, the
security expert said.
But it is the sophistication of hand-held devices that have police on
the look-out.
Internet-enabled phones and gadgets are capable of sending and receiving
elaborate messages detailing meeting locations, maps and last-minute
instructions to fellow protesters in the streets.
The widespread use of picture phones is also a concern as the could be
used to capture images of the police officers.
"Some of these guys run counter-intelligence. They want to know who the
cops are. With a mobile phone that's equipped with a camera you could
start your own database of cops," he said. ($1=.5919 Pound)

New Cellphone Offers Big Shots Eavesdrop-Proof Call
Tue Nov 18,10:23 AM ET  Add Technology - Reuters to My Yahoo!
By Lucas van Grinsven, European Technology Correspondent
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A German company launched a new mobile handset on
Tuesday targeted at business executives that secures lines are free from
eavesdroppers, sparking criticism that it could also make criminals
harder to catch.
Missed Tech Tuesday?
Find the perfect tricked-out cell phone, plus best hybrid phones and
great phone games.
Berlin-based Cryptophone, a unit of privately held GSMK, developed the
phone by inserting an encryption software inside a standard handheld
computer phone. This ensures that calls can only be decoded by a similar
handset or a computer running the software.
But the phone is seen as a mixed blessing in some European countries.
While the benefits for business managers exchanging sensitive
information are obvious, such a device could potentially have the side
effect of helping criminals.
Security specialists in the Netherlands said the device could threaten
criminal investigation by the Dutch police, which is one of the world's
most active phone tappers, listening in to 12,000 phone numbers every
But privacy lobbyists say the new handset is a "freedomphone" much more
than a "terrorphone."
"It's a tremendous step forward, because the level of surveillance by
authorities is breathtaking," said Simon Davies, director of Privacy
International in Britain. Cryptophone says unlike rivals such as
Sweden's Sectra, Swiss Crypto AG and Germany's Rohde & Schwarz, it has
no ties to national security and defense organizations and that there is
no back door for government agencies.
"We allow everyone to check the security for themselves, because we're
the only ones who publish the source code," said Rop Gonggrijp at
Amsterdam-based NAH6. Gonggrijp, who helped develop the software, owns a
stake in Germany's GSMK.

The parent company of DirecTV, the home satellite service, has promised
several federal agencies that it can address concerns about foreign
ownership of sensitive U.S. communications systems if it wins approval
of its proposed merger with Australian-controlled News Corp.
But the merger also has drawn the scrutiny of the Department of Homeland
Security, the FBI and Justice Department divisions in addition to the
antitrust department. The deal would bring DirecTV's five satellites and
sophisticated communications system under the control of a company based
outside the United States.
Chief among the U.S. concerns is that a foreign-owned satellite system
and communications system could be used for illegal surveillance on U.S.
citizens and facilities, according to documents passed this week among
Hughes, News Corp. and the federal government.
"As the [FCC] is aware, the DOJ, FBI and DHS have taken the position
that their ability to satisfy their obligations to protect the national
security, to enforce the laws, and to preserve the safety of the public
could be significantly impaired by transactions in which foreign
entities will own or operate a part of the U.S. communications system,
or in which foreign-located facilities will be used to provide domestic
communications services to U.S. customers," read a letter filed at the
FCC by the three law enforcement agencies last week.
The Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, a group made
up of executive departments and representatives from the State, Defense,
Treasury and Commerce departments, typically reviews transactions
involving foreign ownership of businesses that serve the United States.
In September, for instance, the committee approved the reorganization
plan for Global Crossing, a telecommunications company being acquired
out of bankruptcy by a Singapore-based firm. .

Part of Patriot Act Ruled Unconstitutional
By LINDA DEUTSCH
AP Special Correspondent
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge has declared unconstitutional a
portion of the USA Patriot Act that bars giving expert advice or
assistance to groups designated foreign terrorist organizations.
The ruling marks the first court decision to declare a part of the
post-Sept. 11 anti-terrorism statute unconstitutional, said David Cole,
a Georgetown University law professor who argued the case on behalf of
the Humanitarian Law Project.
In a ruling handed down late Friday and made available Monday, U.S.
District Judge Audrey Collins said the ban on providing "expert advice
or assistance" is impermissibly vague, in violation of the First and
Fifth Amendments.
John Tyler, the Justice Department attorney who argued the case, had no
comment and referred calls to the department press office in Washington.
A message left there was not immediately returned.
The case before the court involved five groups and two U.S. citizens
seeking to provide support for lawful, nonviolent activities on behalf
of Kurdish refugees in Turkey.
The Humanitarian Law Project, which brought the lawsuit, said the
plaintiffs were threatened with 15 years in prison if they advised
groups on seeking a peaceful resolution of the Kurds' campaign for
self-determination in Turkey.
The judge's ruling said the law, as written, does not differentiate
between impermissible advice on violence and encouraging the use of
peaceful, nonviolent means to achieve goals.
"The USA Patriot Act places no limitation on the type of expert advice
and assistance which is prohibited and instead bans the provision of all
expert advice and assistance regardless of its nature," the judge said.
Cole declared the ruling "a victory for everyone who believes the war on
terrorism ought to be fought consistent with constitutional principles."
Of course there are limits in regards to freedom of speech.  They are as
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and
petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
Everything else is, of course, allowed.  -Sunder

FBI makes arrest in movie 'screener' case
Chicago man to be charged with copyright infringementThe Associated
Updated: 9:02 a.m. ET Jan. 23, 2004LOS ANGELES - A man who allegedly
used the Internet to distribute Oscar screener movies sent to him by a
member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been
arrested in Illinois, authorities said.
Agents said the films have been traced back to a longtime Academy
member, 69-year-old actor Carmine Caridi, who was described as a friend
of Spragues.
In addition to the movies, agents said they found an array of
duplicating and illegal satellite television interception equipment in
Spragues home about 20 miles south of downtown Chicago.
Caridi told investigators he sent VHS copies of about 60 movies he
received each year to Sprague. He allegedly told investigators he
received no money for the films, and believed Sprague was merely a film
buff who wished to watch them.

Commitee infiltrated opposition computer files for a year, monitoring
secret strategy memos and periodically passing on copies to the media,
Senate officials told The Globe
"There appears to have been no hacking, no stealing, and no violation of
any Senate rule," Miranda said. "Stealing assumes a property right and
there is no property right to a government document. . . . These
documents are not covered under the Senate disclosure rule because they
are not official business and, to the extent they were disclosed, they
were disclosed inadvertently by negligent [Democratic] staff."
Whether the memos are ultimately deemed to be official business will be
a central issue in any criminal case that could result. Unauthorized
access of such material could be punishable by up to a year in prison --
or, at the least, sanction under a Senate non-disclosure rule.
The computer glitch dates to 2001, when Democrats took control of the
Senate after the defection from the GOP of Senator Jim Jeffords,
Independent of Vermont.
A technician hired by the new judiciary chairman, Patrick Leahy,
Democrat of Vermont, apparently made a mistake that allowed anyone to

both parties -- even though the accounts were supposed to restrict
access only to those with the right password.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge has declared unconstitutional a
portion of the USA Patriot Act that bars giving expert advice or
assistance to groups designated foreign terrorist organizations.
The ruling marks the first court decision to declare a part of the
post-Sept. 11 anti-terrorism statute unconstitutional, said David Cole,
a Georgetown University law professor who argued the case on behalf of
the Humanitarian Law Project.
In a ruling handed down late Friday and made available Monday, U.S.
District Judge Audrey Collins said the ban on providing "expert advice
or assistance" is impermissibly vague, in violation of the First and
Fifth Amendments.
John Tyler, the Justice Department attorney who argued the case, had no
comment and referred calls to the department press office in Washington.
A message left there was not immediately returned.
The case before the court involved five groups and two U.S. citizens
seeking to provide support for lawful, nonviolent activities on behalf
of Kurdish refugees in Turkey.
The Humanitarian Law Project, which brought the lawsuit, said the
plaintiffs were threatened with 15 years in prison if they advised
groups on seeking a peaceful resolution of the Kurds' campaign for
self-determination in Turkey.
The judge's ruling said the law, as written, does not differentiate
between impermissible advice on violence and encouraging the use of
peaceful, nonviolent means to achieve goals.
"The USA Patriot Act places no limitation on the type of expert advice
and assistance which is prohibited and instead bans the provision of all
expert advice and assistance regardless of its nature," the judge said.
Cole declared the ruling "a victory for everyone who believes the war on
terrorism ought to be fought consistent with constitutional principles."
Of course there are limits in regards to freedom of speech.  They are as
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and
petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
Everything else is, of course, allowed.  -Sunder

Blix says US spied on him over Iraq
Reuters London Feb 28: Former chief United Nations weapons inspector Mr
Hans Blix said today he suspected the United States bugged his office
and home in the run-up to the Iraq war, but had no hard evidence.
Describing such behaviour as disgusting, Mr Blix told Britains
Guardian newspaper in an interview: It feels like an intrusion into
your integrity in a situation when you are actually on the same side.
His allegation came on top of a diplomatic row sparked this week when
former British minister Ms Clare Short said Britain bugged UN Secretary
General Mr Kofi Annans office as London and Washington tried but failed
to win UN backing to invade Iraq.
Mr Blix said his suspicions were raised when he had trouble with a
telephone connection at home.
It might have been something trivial or it might have been something
installed somewhere, I dont know, he said.
The Swede said he asked UN counter-surveillance teams to check his
office and home for listening devices.
If you had something sensitive to talk about you would go out into the
restaurant or out into the streets, said Mr Blix.
He said US state department envoy Mr John Wolf visited him two weeks
before the Iraq war with pictures of an Iraqi drone and a cluster bomb
that the former inspector believed could have been secured only from
within the UN weapons office.
He should not have had them. I asked him how he got them and he would
not tell me, Mr Blix said.
It could have been some staff belonging to us that handed them to the
Americans... It could also be that they managed to break into the secure
fax and got it that way, he said.
Ms Short, in government before and during the Iraq war, said on Thursday
she had seen transcripts of what she said were bugged accounts of Mr
Annans conversations. She resigned after the war.
The British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair accused her of being
irresponsible and of undermining intelligence services at a time when
Britain faced a threat of attack from Islamic militants.
Blair said British security services acted within domestic and
international law.
But UN spokesman Mr Fred Eckhard said Mr Annan would seek a fuller
explanation from Britain on the allegations, saying any attempt to
eavesdrop on the Secretary General was illegal and should stop as it
would violate three international treaties.
Mr Blair warned critics like Ms Short that unless they buried
differences they risked ousting his Labour Party from power as it
prepares to fight a general election expected in 2005.
Former UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali and another former
chief UN weapons inspector, Mr Richard Butler, said yesterday they
believed they had been spied on.
From the first day I entered my office they told me: beware, your
office is bugged, your residence is bugged, Mr Boutros-Ghali told the
It is a tradition that member states that have the technical capacity
to bug will do it without hesitation, he said.

Orange County registrar says incorrect electronic ballots may have

March 30, 2004
Although some Orange County voters cast the wrong electronic ballots in
the March 2 primary, potentially altering the outcome of one race for a
Democratic Party post, Registrar Steve Rodermund said he will certify
the results of the election today.
In a report circulated late Monday to the Board of Supervisors,
Rodermund acknowledged for the first time that his office's failures
could have affected a race  and gave ammunition to critics of
electronic voting.
The report said 33 voters out of 16,655 in the 69th Assembly District
received the wrong ballots and were unable to vote for six open seats on
the Democratic Central Committee.
The candidate who finished seventh in that contest, Art Hoffman, trailed
sixth-place candidate Jim Pantone in the final count by 13 votes.
However, 99.7% of Orange County ballots were cast properly in the
primary, Rodermund will tell supervisors today before certifying the
election results to the secretary of state.

Leaders in law enforcement say it will keep officers safe, but others
argue it's a privilege that could be abused.
The decision in United States v. Kelly Gould, No. 0230629cr0, was made
March 24 by the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed in Denham Springs in 2000, in
which a defendant filed a motion to supress information gleaned from a
search of his home. The motion was granted by a district court, and the
government appealed this decision. The March 24 ruling by the 5th
Circuit is an affirmation of that appeal.
New Orleans Police Department spokesman Capt. Marlon Defillo said the
new power will go into effect immediately.
"We have to have a legitimate problem to be there in the first place,
and if we don't, we can't conduct the search," Defillo said.
But former U.S. Attorney Julian Murray said the ruling is problematic.
"I think it goes way too far," Murray said, noting that the searches can
be performed if an officer fears for his safety.
Defillo said he doesn't envision any problems in New Orleans.
"There are checks and balances to make sure the criminal justce system
works in an effective manner," Defillo said.

Appeals Court Lets Interior Computers Back Online, Despite Judge's
Security Concerns
By Robert Gehrke
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Interior Department will go back online after an
appeals court Wednesday blocked a judge's ruling that ordered most of
the department's computers disconnected from the Internet.
It took the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
just three hours to grant the government's request to restore the
Interior's Internet access. It had been shut down since March 15 to
protect money owed to American Indians from computer hackers.
The shutdown disrupted public's access to Interior Department Web pages,
land managers' communications, disbursement of mineral royalties to
states, and education of children in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools.
Interior Secretary Gale Norton said she was pleased with the appeals
court decision and will continue pushing for a permanent reversal of the
Internet shutdown.
"Meanwhile, tonight we have begun to restore our Internet connections
across all impacted agencies of the department and will work quickly to
restore them to pre-March 15 levels," she said.
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the shutdown after the
Interior Department failed to show it had fixed security problems that
left vulnerable to Internet security breaches millions of dollars in
royalties from oil, gas, timber and grazing activities on American
Indian lands.

by Seisint Inc., a private company based in Boca Raton, Fla.

system, said the information Ohio is sharing is already available to law

said James V. Canepa, chief deputy attorney general.
The records include details on property, boats and Internet domain names
that people own, their address history, utility connections,
bankruptcies, liens and business filings, according to an August report
by the Georgia state Office of Homeland Security.
The American Civil Liberties Union has complained that the system,

9 Mar 2004 04:00 GMT WSJ(3/9)Is Military Creeping Into Domestic Law
Copyright © 2004, Dow Jones Newswires
   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL)
   By Robert Block and Gary Fields
IN A LITTLE-NOTICED side effect of the war on terrorism, the military is
edging toward a sensitive area that has been off-limits to it
historically: domestic intelligence gathering and law enforcement.
Several recent incidents involving the military have raised concern
among student and civil-rights groups. One was a visit last month by an
Army intelligence agent to an official at the University of Texas law
school in Austin. The agent demanded a videotape of a recent academic
conference at the school so that he could identify what he described as
"three Middle Eastern men" who had made "suspicious" remarks to Army
lawyers at the seminar, according to the official, Susana Aleman, the
dean of student affairs.
The Army, while not disputing that the visit took place, declined to
comment, saying the incident is under investigation.
Last year, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the nation's primary source
of global maritime intelligence, demanded access to the U.S. Customs
Service's database on maritime trade, saying it needed information to
thwart potential terrorist activity. Customs officials initially
resisted the Navy's demands but eventually agreed to give naval
intelligence much of what it wanted.
In an interview earlier this month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection
chief Robert C. Bonner said he shares data only after getting Navy
assurances that the information won't be abused. Navy spokesman Jon
Spiers says the Office of Naval Intelligence first approached customs
about sharing inbound foreign cargo information in December 2002, and he
denies there is anything improper about the request. The agency "has not
overstepped any authority or crossed the line dividing law enforcement
from military operations," he says.
Lt. Spiers adds that when the Navy's top spy agency gains access to data
about American companies and individuals, the information will be
"subjected to a meticulous legal review" and will be retained only if it
is directly related to the agency's mission to identify potential
foreign threats.
In another sign of military interest in domestic information-gathering,
the Defense Intelligence Agency's new antiterrorism task force is
looking to share information with law-enforcement officials in
California and New York City, according to an August 2003 General
Accounting Office report.
Historically, Americans haven't trusted the military to do domestic
police work. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, passed in response to abuses
by federal troops in the South after the Civil War, prohibits the use of
the military "to execute the laws" of the U.S. That's been widely
interpreted as a ban on searching, arresting or spying on U.S. civilians
by federal troops.
But the law has been violated, notably during the Vietnam War, when Army
operatives spied on antiwar activists on campuses. Meanwhile, Congress
has eased the law's limits to allow the military to help prosecute the
war on drugs.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the White House sought to further loosen
restrictions to allow the military to take on a new domestic-security
role. It has mostly been rebuffed. In May the House refused to approve a
White House-backed proposal to give the Central Intelligence Agency and
the military authority to scrutinize personal and business records of
U.S. citizens. And the Senate last year blocked funding for a Pentagon
project known as the Total Information Awareness program, which was
supposed to collect a vast array of information on individuals,
including medical, employment and credit-card histories.
The issue of an expanding military role in domestic affairs also
surfaced last year with the Pentagon's creation of the Northern Command,
or Northcom, based in Colorado Springs, Colo. The new command, the first
such military command designed to protect the U.S. homeland from a
terrorist attack, has responsibility for the U.S, Canada, Mexico,
portions of the Caribbean and U.S. coastal waters. Northcom's commander,
Gen. Ralph "Ed" Eberhart, is the first general since the Civil War with
operational authority exclusively over military forces within the U.S.
Gen. Eberhart has stoked concern among civil-liberties advocates by
saying that the military and civilians should be involved in developing
"actionable intelligence" for the government. In September 2002, he told
a group of National Guardsmen that the military and the National Guard
should "change our radar scopes" to prevent terrorism. It is important
to "not just look out, but we're also going to have to look in," he
said, adding, "we can't let culture and the way we've always done it
stand in the way."
Northcom officials and other military leaders play down his remarks. "No
one ran out after that speech and started snooping," one official says.
Gen. Eberhart echoed that last September on PBS's "News Hour": "We are
not going to be out there spying on people, " he said, though he added,
"we get information from people who do."
Further evidence of the blurring of the lines between the civilian and
military worlds comes in a job-vacancy notice for a senior
counterintelligence advisor to Northcom. The duties, according to the
notice, include providing advice that goes beyond potential terrorism to
include "other major criminal activity, such as drug cartels and
large-scale money laundering" -- work usually under the purview of the
Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the Secret Service.
Another little-known Pentagon group, the Counterintelligence Field
Activity, was set up two years ago. With 400 service members and
civilians stationed around the globe, the CIFA was originally charged
with protecting the military and critical infrastructure from spying by
terrorists and foreign intelligence services. But in August, Paul
Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, issued a directive ordering the
unit to maintain a "domestic law-enforcement database that includes
information related to potential terrorist threats directed against the
Department of Defense."
The CIFA also works closely with the FBI and is conducting some duties
for civilian agencies. For example, according to Department of
Agriculture documents, the CIFA is in charge of doing background checks
on foreign workers and scientists employed by the department's
agricultural-research service. The group also provides information to
the Information and Security Command, or Inscom, the Army's main
intelligence organization, based at Fort Belvoir, Md.
The Army intelligence agent who investigated the law-school conference
was assigned to Inscom. Army officials reviewing the Texas incident
concede that the agent may have overstepped his boundaries and should
have tried to win the voluntary cooperation of the faculty and students.
But they say that he was reacting to a possible counterintelligence
threat to the military. It isn't clear why there were Army lawyers at
the conference in the first place, though some officials say the
attorneys wanted to learn more about Muslim traditions and Islamic law.
Civil-rights advocates are skeptical. Robert Pugsley, professor of law
at the Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles, says the
Texas incident is "a chilling example" of the military's overreaching.
"It'll multiply like fleas on a dog" if left unchecked, he says.
"What we are starting to see is 50 years of legal refinement and
revisions for oversight being quietly jettisoned," adds Steven
Aftergood, an intelligence policy specialist at the Federation of
American Scientists, a nonprofit, left-leaning think tank in Washington.
But James Carafano, a policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation in
Washington, says he believes the military has honored posse comitatus.
His concern is that hard distinctions have been created between who has
jurisdiction in homeland defense versus homeland security. It's
distinctions terrorists might exploit, he says. "We may potentially be
creating vulnerabilities."

Toss Out the Toss-Up: Bias in heads-or-tails
Erica Klarreich
If you want to decide which football team takes the ball first or who
gets the larger piece of
cake, the fairest thing is to toss a coin, right? Not necessarily.
A new mathematical analysis suggests that coin tossing is inherently
biased: A coin is more likely
to land on the same face it started out on.
"I don't care how vigorously you throw it, you can't toss a coin
fairly," says Persi Diaconis, a
statistician at Stanford University who performed the study with Susan
Holmes of Stanford and
Richard Montgomery of the University of California, Santa Cruz.
In 1986, mathematician Joseph Keller, now an emeritus professor at
Stanford, proved that one
fair way to toss a coin is to throw it so that it spins perfectly around
a horizontal axis through the
coin's center.
Such a perfect toss would require superhuman precision. Every other
possible toss is biased,
according to an analysis described on Feb. 14 in Seattle at the annual
meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
The researchers' logic goes like this. At the opposite extreme from
Keller's perfect toss is a
completely biased toss, in which the coin stays flat while in the air.
Since the coin never actually
flips, it is guaranteed to land on the same face that it started out on.
Between the perfectly spinning toss and the flat toss lies a continuum
of other possibilities, in
which the coin spins around a tilted axis, precessing like an
old-fashioned children's top. Each of
these possibilities is biased, the team found. The bias is most
pronounced when the flip is close
to being a flat toss. For a wide range of possible spins, the coin never
flips at all, the team
In experiments, the researchers were surprised to find that it's
difficult to tell from watching a
coin whether it has flipped. A coin toss typically takes just half a
second, with the circumference
of the coin whizzing around at 3 meters per second. What's more, the
coin's spin makes it
wobble, often creating the illusion that the coin has flipped.
"Sometimes we had the complete impression that the coin had turned over
when it really hadn't,"
Holmes says.
Magicians and charlatans may take advantage of this illusion. Keller
observes, "Some people
can throw the coin up so that it just wobbles but looks to the observer
as if it is turning over." To
see whether the predicted bias shows up in actual coin tosses, the team
made movies of tossed
coins and then calculated the axes of spin.
Their preliminary data suggest that a coin will land the same way it
started about 51 percent of
the time. It would take about 10,000 tosses before a casual observer
would become aware of
such a small bias, Diaconis says. "Maybe that's why society hasn't
noticed this before," he says.
This slight bias pales when compared with that of spinning a coin on its
edge. A spinning penny
will land as tails about
80 percent of the time, Diaconis says, because the extra material on the
head side shifts the
center of mass slightly.
During World War II, South African mathematician John Kerrich carried
out 10,000 coin tosses
while interned in a German prison camp. However, he didn't record which
side the coin started
on, so he couldn't have discovered the kind of bias the new analysis
brings out.
Says David Aldous, a statistician at the University of California,
Berkeley, "This is a good lesson
that even in simple things that people take for granted, there may be
unexpected subtleties."

The Pinellas school system is ready to approve a new technology that
uses student fingerprints to keep track of who is riding school buses.
Beginning in the fall, the fingerprint system would identify students as
they board and leave. The goal is to ensure they are getting on the
right bus and getting off at the right stop.
School officials say the $2-million project will save money and
dramatically improve safety for students, whose fingerprints will serve
as authorization to board and disembark.
If the School Board approves the proposal March 9, Pinellas will become
one of four Florida school districts in the process of implementing
Global Positioning Systems with a student-tracking system.
"This is Management 101 in transportation. Now we will have good,
factual information that we can use in a very timely manner to make our
services as good as humanly possible," said Terry Palmer, the district's
transportation director.
But some parents and national organizations are concerned about the
implications of fingerprinting 45,000 bus riders, some as young as 5.
"This is probably a really good idea, but in my mind it was just this
terrible feeling, like they're watching my kids wherever they go," said
Nancy McKibben, mother of three teenagers at Palm Harbor University High
School and president of the school's PTSA.
Critics say programs of this nature raise significant privacy concerns
and teach students at a young age to accept what amounts to a "Big
Brother" surveillance society.
"We are conditioning these children to understand that they have no
personal space, no personal privacy," said Barry Steinhardt, director of

Some Insurers Checking Provider Lists for Terrorists
     Joyce Frieden
     Associate Editor, Practice Trends
Insurance plans say they now must cross-reference lists of business
partnersincluding providersagainst a federal list of known or
suspected terrorists.
As a result of an executive order issued shortly after Sept. 11, 2001,
many health plans say that they are now required to compare their
provider, member, and applicant lists with a list of potential
terrorists maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Control (OFAC).
If we didn't have to do it, we probably wouldn't, said Helen Stojic,
spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which is matching
the names on the OFAC list against its database of 4.8 million members
and 20,000 providers. [But] we did not see it as something that was
Other plans that are checking member and provider databases with the
OFAC list include Cigna and Aetna US Healthcare. So far, none of
those three plans has found any matches to the list.
The executive order states that any transaction or dealing by United
States persons or within the United States in property  blocked
pursuant to this order is prohibited, including but not limited to the
making or receiving  of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit
those persons listed by the government. Because there was some
confusion about whether the order applied to health insurers, the
Association of Health Plans-Health Insurance Association of America
sought more information from the Treasury Department.
The Treasury Department sent back an informal guidance document
explaining that the executive order applies to government agencies and
private companies including health plans and insurers and that one
method for health plans and insurers to comply is to search their
to see if there are any individuals or businesses that match the names
on the OFAC list.
If a plan does receive an insurance application from someone on the
list, it is obligated not to issue the policy, and if it has
already issued a policy to a person on the list, plan officials are
supposed to contact the Treasury Department.
Although the document did not say that comparing lists was the only way
to find out if an insurer is doing business with a suspected terrorist,
I haven't heard of any other method, Ms. Stojic said.
The federal government is not alone in requiring health insurers to
comply with the executive order, noted Fred Laberge, spokesman for Aetna
US Healthcare, in Hartford, Conn. We've seen similar requests from
state departments of insurance saying, We've seen this executive order;
demonstrate that you're complying with it. Florida and New York are
among the states that have made these requests, he said.
Since member and provider lists change constantly, the cross-referencing
will be ongoing, plans say. It includes scanning of our databases
on a periodic basis to screen new customers and transactions on the OFAC
list, said Cigna spokeswoman Amy Turkington.
Plans say these checks do not compromise any personal health information
or raise any privacy concerns under the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
We're not sharing any information about our members beyond checking the
list of names, said Aetna's Mr. Laberge. Private medical
information is not even being looked at or asked about.
Still, civil libertarians are not happy with the order. We know that
databases are filled with errors, said Virginia Rezmierski, Ph.D., of
school of public policy at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. If a
patient's account is mistakenly frozen because he or she is thought to
on the OFAC list, what does that do to someone getting ready to have a
Checking names against the OFAC list is not as bad as using claims data
to do the same thing, Dr. Rezmierski said. However, by
approaching terrorism and deterrence of it in this way, we've
effectively thrown out the entire notion of innocent till proven guilty.
We are now
guilty until there's no match. Instead of going from knowledge about the
behavior of an individual and having cause to do this violation, we're
violating everyone.
Jay Stanley, communications director for the technology and liberty
program at the American Civil Liberties Union, said he was concerned
this is part of an overall trend of the government enlisting private
individuals and companies into its information-gathering and enforcement
Obviously, it's a good thing if no one does business with true
terrorists, Mr. Stanley said. But the problem is that there are no
guidelines for due process in how one gets placed on these lists.
Mistakes have been rife, especially when you are talking about Arab
 which have to be translated into a different alphabet.
Mr. Stanley noted that such lists are set up primarily to prevent
terrorists from laundering money through unsuspecting American
As far as I can tell, nobody uses health insurance to launder money.
There are basic questions that need to be asked about the cost and
benefit of targeting here.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the eve of grand jury proceedings in the Michael
Jackson molestation case, the presiding judge of the Santa Barbara
courts barred pictures or communication with any prospective or final
panelists, or grand jury witnesses.
Superior Court Judge Clifford R. Anderson III did not mention Jackson's
name in his order Wednesday, but acknowledged a grand jury summoned this
week "has created significant media and public interest."
The order threatens to hold in contempt anyone who communicates with a
juror, prospective grand juror or witness - or reveals secret testimony.
It also prohibits photography of jurors or prospective jurors entering
and exiting the courthouse and "any other facility or property utilized
by the grand jury."
Media lawyers immediately protested, calling the order "overbroad and
unconstitutional prohibition of activity protected under the First
Amendment and California law." They said the courthouse and its environs
have long been recognized as a public forum.
"I've not seen an order so broad and so sweeping," said attorney
Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represents several media organizations
including The Associated Press.

Watermark Annotation Management System
Maj. Variola (ret), the OsamaSoft Corporation
To deter torture, physically *destroy* your data.
If you can't destroy it, you need a *duress* system.
It will at least buy some time.
Specs for a duress system:
    Adversary can't know if there's more data
   You can reveal multiple passphrases to satisfy the Adversary (incl.
false data)
The former requires stego, otherwise the Adversary could tell that
there's more data.
The latter requires that your stego'd info doesn't interfere with other
stego'd data.
Simple Multiple-Use Implementation:
    Treat the cover media as a block-sized filesystem.  The user must
    (and keep track of) the index of the block to embed the payload.
    extract data, only a passphrase (not index) is needed if a checksum
    data in each occupied block.  Multiple blocks can be embedded using
    the same passphrase, they are all decoded when that passphrase is
    (I don't think its possible to store allocation info *in* the file
without giving away
    the presence of more occupied blocks!)
   As a watermarking system, anyone can embed any type of watermark in a
   "block" so long as block occupations are tracked globally.  eBay
could stego-watermark
   images in the upper left quadrant, individuals get to use the upper
right.  Each
  could use their own watermarking tools.
   As a collaborative tool, if the annotations are all plaintext this
could be like writing
    comments on the back of a JPG.  With the convenience of keeping them
    the image.
   As a duress file system, the watermarks are secret data.   They are
compressed, encrypted,
  then embedded in the given block of the cover media.  It would be
smart to use
  boring annotations in some blocks so that its not unusual to use the
tool with the cover media.
  (One should also use layers of increasingly sensitive info to give up
gradually, as well
   as plausible fakes.)

A nym is just a token, a string, a handle.  You can make it more by
making it persistant across sessions (ie, keep using the same RSA key
instead of using ephemeral DH or one-time RSA keys to authenticate
a single session.); normally folks do this to accrue reputation as well
as for convenience.  All you need is the same RSA key used above.
You can further concretize a nym by associating it with a human
subject to Men w/ Guns.  But its not necessary, any more than
persistant authentication (reputation) is.  You can use a throw-away
email account, or public key, for each message, thread, clique, etc.

is the Adversary watching any movement on that 'account'?
To use the credits, someone has to talk to a clearing house

 Neuronal networks have been extensively studied as computational
systems, but they also serve as communications networks in
 transferring large amounts of information between brain areas. Recent
work suggests that their structure and function are
 governed by basic principles of resource allocation and constraint
minimization, and that some of these principles are shared with
 human-made electronic devices and communications networks. The
discovery that neuronal networks follow simple design rules
 resembling those found in other networks is striking because nervous
systems have many unique properties.
 To generate complicated patterns of behavior, nervous systems have
evolved prodigious abilities to process information.
 Evolution has made use of the rich molecular repertoire, versatility,
and adaptability of cells. Neurons can receive and deliver signals at up
to 105 synapses and can
 combine and process synaptic inputs, both linearly and nonlinearly, to
implement a rich repertoire of operations that process information (1).
Neurons can also
 establish and change their connections and vary their signaling
properties according to a variety of rules. Because many of these
changes are driven by spatial and
 temporal patterns of neural signals, neuronal networks can adapt to
circumstances, self-assemble, autocalibrate, and store information by
changing their properties
 according to experience.
 The simple design rules improve efficiency by reducing (and in some
cases minimizing) the resources required to implement a given task. It
should come as no surprise
 that brains have evolved to operate efficiently. Economy and efficiency
are guiding principles in physiology that explain, for example, the way
in which the lungs, the
 circulation, and the mitochondria are matched and coregulated to supply
energy to muscles (2). To identify and explain efficient design, it is
necessary to derive and
 apply the structural and physicochemical relationships that connect
resource use to performance. We consider first a number of studies of
the geometrical constraints
 on packing and wiring that show that the brain is organized to reduce
wiring costs. We then examine a constraint that impinges on all aspects
of neural function but has
 only recently become apparentenergy consumption. Next we look at
energy-efficient neural codes that reduce signal traffic by exploiting
the relationships that
 govern the representational capacity of neurons. We end with a brief
discussion on how synaptic plasticity may reconfigure the cortical
network on a wide range of
 time scales.
 Geometrical and Biophysical Constraints on Wiring
 Reducing the size of an organ, such as the brain, while maintaining
adequate function is usually beneficial. A smaller brain requires fewer
materials and less energy for
 construction and maintenance, lighter skeletal elements and muscles for
support, and less energy for carriage. The size of a nervous system can
be reduced by
 reducing the number of neurons required for adequate function, by
reducing the average size of neurons, or by laying out neurons so as to
reduce the lengths of their
 connections. The design principles governing economical layout have
received the most attention.
 Just like the wires connecting components in electronic chips, the
connections between neurons occupy a substantial fraction of the total
volume, and the wires (axons
 and dendrites) are expensive to operate because they dissipate energy
during signaling. Nature has an important advantage over electronic
circuits because
 components are connected by wires in three-dimensional (3D) space,
whereas even the most advanced VLSI (very large scale integration)
microprocessor chips use
 a small number of layers of planar wiring. [A recently produced chip
with 174 million transistors has seven layers (3).] Does 3D wiring
explain why the volume
 fraction of wiring in the brain (40 to 60%; see below) is lower than in
chips (up to 90%)? In chips, the components are arranged to reduce the
total length of wiring.
 This same design principle has been established in the nematode worm
Caenorhabditis elegans, which has 302 neurons arranged in 11 clusters
called ganglia. An
 exhaustive search of alternative ganglion placements shows that the
layout of ganglia minimizes wire length (4).
 Cortical projections in the early sensory processing areas are
topographically organized. This is a hallmark of the six-layer
neocortex, in contrast to the more diffuse
 projections in older three-layer structures such as the olfactory
cortex and the hippocampus. In the primary visual cortex, for example,
neighboring regions of the
 visual field are represented by neighboring neurons in the cortex.
Connectivity is much higher between neurons separated by less than 1 mm
than between neurons
 farther apart (see below), reflecting the need for rapid, local
processing within a cortical columnan arrangement that minimizes wire
length. Because cortical neurons
 have elaborately branched dendritic trees (which serve as input
regions) and axonal trees (which project the output to other neurons),
it is also possible to predict the
 optimal geometric patterns of connectivity (57), including the optimal
ratios of axonal to dendritic arbor volumes (8). These conclusions were
anticipated nearly 100
 years ago by the great neuroanatomist Ramon y Cajal: "After the many
shapes assumed by neurons, we are now in a position to ask whether this
diversity... has been
 left to chance and is insignificant, or whether it is tightly regulated
and provides an advantage to the organism.... We realized that all of
the various conformations of
 the neuron and its various components are simply morphological
adaptations governed by laws of conservation for time, space, and
material" [(9), p. 116].
 The conservation of time is nicely illustrated in the gray matter of
the cerebral cortex. Gray matter contains the synapses, dendrites, cell
bodies, and local axons of
 neurons, and these structures form the neural circuits that process
information. About 60% of the gray matter is composed of axons and
dendrites, reflecting a high
 degree of local connectivity analogous to a local area network. An
ingenious analysis of resource allocation suggests that this wiring
fraction of 60% minimizes local
 delays (10). This fraction strikes the optimum balance between two
opposing tendencies: transmission speed and component density. Unlike
the wires in chips,
 reducing the diameter of neural wires reduces the speed at which
signals travel, prolonging delays. But it also reduces axon volume, and
this allows neurons to be
 packed closer together, thus shortening delays.
 Global Organization of the Communication Network
 Long-range connections between cortical areas constitute the white
matter and occupy 44% of the cortical volume in humans. The thickness of
gray matter, just a few
 millimeters, is nearly constant in species that range in brain volume
over five orders of magnitude. The volume of the white matter scales
approximately as the 4/3
 power of the volume of the gray matter, which can be explained by the
need to maintain a fixed bandwidth of long-distance communication
capacity per unit area of
 the cortex (11) (Fig. 1). The layout of cortical areas minimizes the
total lengths of the axons needed to join them (12). The prominent folds
of the human cortex allow
 the large cortical area to be packed in the skull but also allow
cortical areas around the convolutions to minimize wire length; the
location of the folds may even arise
 from elastic forces in the white matter during development (13).
                              Fig. 1. Cortical white and gray matter
volumes of 59 mammalian species are related by a power law that spans
five to six
                              orders of magnitude. The line is the least
squares fit, with a slope around 1.23 ± 0.01 (mean ± SD) and correlation
of 0.998.
                              The number of white matter fibers is
proportional to the gray matter volume; their average length is the
cubic root of that
                              volume. If the fiber cross section is
constant, then the white matter volume should scale approximately as the
4/3 power of the
                              gray matter volume. An additional factor
arises from the cortical thickness, which scales as the 0.10 power of
the gray matter
                              volume. [Adapted from (11)] [View Larger
Version of this Image (44K GIF file)]
 The global connectivity in the cortex is very sparse, and this too
reduces the volume occupied by long-range connections: The probability
of any two cortical neurons
 having a direct connection is around one in a hundred for neurons in a
vertical column 1 mm in diameter, but only one in a million for distant
neurons. The distribution
 of wire lengths on chips follows an inverse power law, so that shorter
wires also dominate (14). If we created a matrix with 1010 rows and
columns to represent the
 connections between every pair of cortical neurons, it would have a
relatively dense set of entries around the diagonal but would have only
sparse entries outside the
 diagonal, connecting blocks of neurons corresponding to cortical areas.
 The sparse long-range connectivity of the cortex may offer some of the
advantages of small-world connectivity (15). Thus, only a small fraction
of the computation
 that occurs locally can be reported to other areas, through a small
fraction of the cells that connect distant cortical areas; but this may
be enough to achieve activity
 that is coordinated in distant parts the brain, as reflected in the
synchronous firing of action potentials in these areas, supported by
massive feedback projections
 between cortical areas and reciprocal interactions with the thalamus
(16, 17).
 Despite the sparseness of the cortical connection matrix, the potential
bandwidth of all of the neurons in the human cortex is around a terabit
per second (assuming a
 maximum rate of 100 bits/s over each axon in the white matter),
comparable to the total world backbone capacity of the Internet in 2002
(18). However, this
 capacity is never achieved in practice because only a fraction of
cortical neurons have a high rate of firing at any given time (see
below). Recent work suggests that
 another physical constraintthe provision of energylimits the brain's
ability to harness its potential bandwidth.
 Energy Usage Constrains Neural Communication
 As the processor speeds of computers increase, the energy dissipation
increases, so that cooling technology becomes critically important.
Energy consumption also
 constrains neural processing. Nervous systems consume metabolic energy
continuously at relatively high rates per gram, comparable to those of
heart muscle (19).
 Consequently, powering a brain is a major drain on an animal's energy
budget, typically 2 to 10% of resting energy consumption. In humans this
proportion is 20%
 for adults and 60% for infants (20), which suggests that the brain's
energy demands limit its size (21).
 Energy supply limits signal traffic in the brain (Fig. 2). Deep
anesthesia blocks neural signaling and halves the brain's energy
consumption, which suggests that about
 50% of the brain's energy is used to drive signals along axons and
across synapses. The remainder supports the maintenance of resting
potentials and the vegetative
 function of neurons and glia. Cortical gray matter uses a higher
proportion of total energy consumption for signaling, more than 75%
(Fig. 2), because it is so richly
 interconnected with axons and synapses (21). From the amounts of energy
used when neurons signal, one can calculate the volume of signal traffic
that can be
 supported by the brain's metabolic rate. For cerebral cortex, the
permissible traffic is 5 action potentials per neuron per second in rat
(Fig. 2) (22) and <1 per
 second in human (23). Given that the brain responds quickly, the
permissible level of traffic is remarkably low, and this metabolic limit
must influence the way in which
 information is processed. Recent work suggests that brains have
countered this severe metabolic constraint by adopting energy-efficient
designs. These designs
 involve the miniaturization of components, the elimination of
superfluous signals, and the representation of information with
energy-efficient codes.
                              Fig. 2. Power consumption limits neural
signaling rate in the gray matter of rat cerebral cortex. Baseline
consumption is set by
                              the energy required to maintain the
resting potentials of neurons and associated supportive tissue (r.p.)
and to satisfy their
                              vegetative needs (nonsignaling). Signaling
consumption rises linearly with the average signaling rate (the rate at
which neurons
                              transmit action potentials). The measured
rates of power consumption in rat gray matter vary across cortical areas
and limit
                              average signaling rates to 3 to 5.5 Hz.

 Miniaturization, Energy, and Noise
 The observation that 1 mm3 of mouse cortex contains 105 neurons, 108
synapses, and 4 km of axon (24) suggests that, as in chip design, the
brain reduces energy
 consumption by reducing the size and active area of components. Even
though axon diameter is only 0.3 µm (on average), sending action
potentials along these
 "wires" consumes more than one-third of the energy supplied to cortical
gray matter (22). Thus, as with computer chips, an efficient layout
(discussed above) and a
 high component density are essential for energy efficiency but, as is
also true for chips, miniaturization raises problems about noise.
 When a neuron's membrane area is reduced, the number of molecular pores
(ion channels) carrying electrical current falls, leading to a decline
in the signal-to-noise
 ratio (SNR) (2527). The noise produced by ion channels, and by other
molecular signaling mechanisms such as synaptic vesicles, is potentially
damaging to
 performance. However, the effects of noise are often difficult to
determine because they depend on interactions between signaling
molecules in signaling systems.
 These interactions can be highly nonlinear (e.g., the voltage-dependent
interactions between sodium and potassium ion channels that produce
action potentials) and
 can involve complicated spatial effects (e.g., the diffusion of
chemical messengers between neurons and the transmission of electrical
signals within neurons). A new
 generation of stochastic simulators is being developed to handle these
complexities and determine the role played by molecular noise and
diffusion in neural signaling
 (26, 28, 29). With respect to miniaturization, stochastic simulations
(25) show that channel noise places a realistic ceiling on the wiring
density of the brain by setting a
 lower limit of about 0.1 µm on axon diameter.
 The buildup of noise from stage to stage may be a fundamental
limitation on the logical depth to which brains can compute (30). The
analysis of the relationships
 among signal, noise, and bandwidth and their dependence on energy
consumption will play a central role in understanding the design of
neural circuits. The cortex has
 many of the hallmarks of an energy-efficient hybrid device (28). In
hybrid electronic devices, compact analog modules operate on signals to
process information, and
 the results are converted to digital data for transmission through the
network and then reconverted to analog data for further processing.
These hybrids offer the ability
 of analog devices to perform basic arithmetic functions such as
division directly and economically, combined with the ability of digital
devices to resist noise. In the
 energy-efficient silicon cochlea, for example, the optimal mix of
analog and digital data (that is, the size and number of operations
performed in analog modules) is
 determined by a resource analysis that quantifies trade-offs among
energy consumption, bandwidth for information transmission, and
precision in analog and digital
 components. The obvious similarities between hybrid devices and neurons
strongly suggest that hybrid processing makes a substantial contribution
to the energy
 efficiency of the brain (31). However, the extent to which the brain is
configured as an energy-efficient hybrid device must be established by a
detailed resource
 analysis that is based on biophysical relationships among energy
consumption, precision, and bandwidth in neurons.
 Some research strongly suggests that noise makes it uneconomical to
transfer information down single neurons at high rates (29, 31). Given
that a neuron is a
 noise-limited device of restricted bandwidth, the information rate is
improved with the SNR, which increases as the square root of the number
of ion channels, making
 improvements expensive (25). Thus, doubling the SNR means quadrupling
the number of channels, the current flow, and hence the energy cost.
Given this
 relationship between noise and energy cost, an energy-efficient nervous
system will divide information among a larger number of relatively noisy
neurons of lower
 information capacity, as observed in the splitting of retinal signals
into ON and OFF pathways (32). Perhaps the unreliability of individual
neurons is telling us that the
 brain has evolved to be energy efficient (31).
 Saving on Traffic
 Energy efficiency is improved when one reduces the number of signals in
the network without losing information. In the nervous system, this
amounts to an economy
 of impulses (33) that has the additional advantage of increasing
salience by laying out information concisely. Economy is achieved by
eliminating redundancy. This
 important design principle is well established in sensory processing
(34). Redundancy reduction is a goal of algorithms that compress files
to reduce network traffic.
 In the brain, efficiency is improved by distributing signals
appropriately in time and space. Individual neurons adopt distributions
of firing rate (35, 36) that maximize
 the ratio between information coded and energy expended. Networks of
neurons achieve efficiency by distributing signals sparsely in space and
time. Although it was
 already recognized that sparse coding improves energy efficiency (37),
it was Levy and Baxter's detailed analysis of this problem (38) that
initiated theoretical studies
 of energy-efficient coding in nervous systems. They compared the
representational capacity of signals distributed across a population of
neurons with the costs
 involved. Sparse coding schemes, in which a small proportion of cells
signal at any one time, use little energy for signaling but have a high
representational capacity,
 because there are many different ways in which a small number of
signals can be distributed among a large number of neurons. However, a
large population of
 neurons could be expensive to maintain, and if these neurons rarely
signal, they are redundant. The optimum proportion of active cells
depends on the ratio between
 the cost of maintaining a neuron at rest and the extra cost of sending
a signal. When signals are relatively expensive, it is best to
distribute a few of them among a large
 number of cells. When cells are expensive, it is more efficient to use
few of them and to get all of them signaling. Estimates of the ratio
between the energy demands of
 signaling and maintenance suggest that, for maximum efficiency, between
1% and 16% of neurons should be active at any one time (22, 23, 38).
However, it is
 difficult to compare these predictions with experimental data; a major
problem confronting systems neuroscience is the development of
techniques for deciphering
 sparse codes.
 There is an intriguing possibility that the energy efficiency of the
brain is improved by regulating signal traffic at the level of the
individual synaptic connections between
 neurons. A typical cortical neuron receives on the order of 10,000
synapses, but the probability that a synapse fails to release
neurotransmitter in response to an
 incoming signal is remarkably high, between 0.5 and 0.9. Synaptic
failures halve the energy consumption of gray matter (22), but because
there are so many
 synapses, the failures do not necessarily lose information (39, 40).
The minimum number of synapses required for adequate function is not
known. Does the
 energy-efficient cortical neuron, like the wise Internet user, select
signals from sites that are most informative? This question draws energy
efficiency into one of the
 most active and important areas of neuroscience: synaptic plasticity.
 Reconfiguring the Network
 Long-distance communication in the brain occurs through all-or-none
action potentials, which are transmitted down axons and converted to
analog chemical and
 electrical signals at synapses. The initiation of action potentials in
the cortex can occur with millisecond precision (41) but, as we have
just discussed, the
 communication at cortical synapses is probabilistic. On a short time
scale of milliseconds to seconds, presynaptic mechanisms briefly
increase or decrease the
 probability of transmission at cortical synapses over a wide range,
depending on the previous patterns of activity (42). On longer time
scales, persistent correlated
 firing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons can produce
long-term depression or potentiation of the synaptic efficacy, depending
on the relative timing of
 the spikes in the two neurons (43).
 A new view of the cortical network is emerging from these discoveries.
Rather than being a vast, fixed network whose connection strengths
change slowly, the
 effective cortical connectivity is highly dynamic, changing on fast as
well as slow time scales. This allows the cortex to be rapidly
reconfigured to meet changing
 computational and communications needs (44). Unfortunately, we do not
yet have techniques for eavesdropping on a large enough number of
neurons to determine
 how global reconfiguration is achieved. Local field potentials (LFPs),
extracellular electric fields that reflect the summed activity from
local synaptic currents and other
 ion channels on neurons and glial cells, may provide hints of how the
flow of information in cortical circuits is regulated (16). Oscillations
in the 20- to 80-Hz range
 occur in the LFPs, and the coherence between spikes and these
oscillations has been found to be influenced by attention and working
memory (45, 46).
 Conclusions
 The more we learn about the structure and function of brains, the more
we come to appreciate the great precision of their construction and the
high efficiency of their
 operations. Neurons, circuits, and neural codes are designed to
conserve space, materials, time, and energy. These designs are exhibited
in the geometry of the
 branches of dendritic trees, in the precise determination of wiring
fractions, in the laying out of maps in the brain, in the processing of
signals, and in neural codes. It is
 less obvious, but highly likely, that the unreliability of single
neurons is also a mark of efficiency, because noise in molecular
signaling mechanisms places a high price
 on precision. To an extent yet to be determined, the noise and
variability observed among neurons is compensated by plasticitythe
ability of neurons to modify their
 signaling properties. Neural plasticity also has the potential to
direct the brain's scarce resources to where they will be of greatest

Friday, April 02, 2004
Utah has become the first state to make spyware a crime, passing a law
that makes it illegal to install such programs on a PC without approval.
Starting in early May, violators face a fine of $10,000 per incident,
under the new Spyware Control Act. The Utah law aims to regulate the use
of spyware and other advertising software, which is infamous for
annoying computer users by tracking and reporting their Web whereabouts
and displaying ads.
A software company that wants to load a surveillance program onto a Utah
user's PC must make full disclosure, under the law. It must reveal what
user behavior its software records, what information goes back to a
central server, how often ads will appear, and how the ads look. Vendors
must also clearly state the purpose of the downloaded software and any
changes it makes to a PC's system.
Opponents say the Spyware Control Act is a legal threat to a technology
company's right to innovate. Hackett says the Utah law could be
interpreted to ban free ad-sponsored software, and perhaps even threaten
common e-mail programs that track when and which messages are delivered.
State Rep. Urquhart says the law will let a Utah firm sue a spyware
company that doesn't follow the Spyware Control Act, when its program
displays ads on the Web site of a Utah-based business. He also says the
act will help protect consumers by forcing spyware companies to be more
upfront about their software.

Eugene Volokh, 3/25/2004 04:02:38 PM
Israeli coders, Arab testers: A reader writes, apropos
checking sensitive source code for sabotage:  I spoke to
[someone] from the NSA, about this subject a couple of
years back. As you probably know, although the NSA has
teams of cryptographers at its disposal, a large amount
of the successful interception it carries out is simply
due to exploiting software faults in communications soft-
ware. Consequently, in their other role, as advisor to
the DoD about communications security issues, they focus
on software assurance to an extent that often takes new-
comers by surprise.
The NSA used to have a requirement that only American
citizens should be allowed to work on sensitive source
code, because they considered there to be too great a
risk of backdoors being placed in the code by foreign
nationals . . . . More recently, because of the number
of H1(B)s and green cards in the computer industry, it's
been impractical for the NSA to insist on that. Instead,
what they've encouraged -- and this is the interesting
and quite clever part -- is that programmers and testers
should be of different nationalities. If you have Israeli
coders, get Arabic testers. If you have British coders,
get French testers. And so on.
A cute solution to the problem. But I don't know if it
ever worked. I suspect the NSA still insists, though,
that source code for sensitive systems be written by
American companies on American soil, even if it isn't
written by American fingers.Of course, even if the NSA's
program worked for the NSA, it would be pretty expensive
to adopt for the important source code and off-the-shelf
object code used by lots of other organizations -- many
of which are private companies -- that manage critical
American infrastructure. Nor am I sure that it would work
that well even if it were adopted. Still, it struck me as
interesting enough to be worth mentioning.

The implementation tech shouldn't matter, latency & throughput aside.
Merging vs. fighting vs. stasis is a matter of physics, and game theory.
Physics, because large entities have different properties (eg
surface-to-mass ratio; inertia) than small entities.
In the 40s it was a lot easier for the US
to muster the resources for the Bomb than it was for say England.
Similarly with spy satellites.  In a cold environment large animals
do better; in a modern tech environment high-investment entities do
If you're maintaining territory, large pieces have less boundary to
Game theory, because the costs to the organism of the fight
may be prohibitive.  Which is why most animals bluff.  And
why China, Russia, etc won't be attacked.  M.A.D.  All your
Taiwanese are belong to us.
An interesting question is what happens when it doesn't
take a large entity to have large force.  The Colt revolver
was an example of this equalization.  So is a fission bomb.
(However anyone could buy a Colt, soon eliminating that advantage.

What you get then, as Heinlein wrote, is a very polite society.
(Xor one without a population growth problem :-)   Sort of like
the South when dueling was popular.  Until
the next leap in tech not accessable to all comes around.
(Duelling with AKs would be pretty cool, eh?)
Adding irrationality to game theory gets interesting too.
"Better dead than red" changes the game.
If you can sell your delusions about "heaven" or "patriotism" to
(and possibly the population that supports them) then the cost-benefit
changes.   Engaging the endocrines is pretty much all the bubblehead in
has going for him.
So what does this mean for the geodesic neo-Merc industry?
It means that the US (and other large players) will keep shutter control
on satellites,
will pursue arms dealers, will bomb bomb-plants before they produce.
The tanks that can shoot farthest will still be controlled.  As will the
vision stuff, secure comms, etc.  Note that shutter control can include
"accidentally" bombing a chinese embassy in yugoslavia :-)
In smaller terms, private security guards won't be getting fullauto
weapons, high-end
body armor, or the same bugging tech as the USG endorsed ones.
PS: note that if the USG "endorses" a merc group too much, by allowing
them (but not others) to buy the Good Stuff, the USG endangers itself.
The mercs themselves needn't be American.
Israel would be a good example.  (How many Hellfires *does* it
take to hit an old man in a wheelchair?)
Plus you get the awkward political and military problems when your
friends turn enemies.
All this doesn't rule out proxy wars in backwaters (with official or
merc troops),
or underground mafia-style merc wars between factions overlayed on a
government territory, but it does impose constraints on future mercs so
long as the pre-existing nations continue to exist.
Basically no one fucks with the elephants, and the lions are free to
for territory, but mostly they'll bluff between themselves.  (Unless
they're desparate, in which case they'll probably lose.)  And because
you have to share your kill,
there is a cost associated with merging territories.

One can run a P2P app from mains-powered home machine
and incur only a minor bandwidth penalty, which you can
possibly throttle when you're busy.  But my
understanding of *mobile* devices (where meshing matters) is that they
severely power constrained.  To the extent that
boozohol power cells and various semiconductor/logic
tricks are being used, despite the difficulties they require.
So, get a clue.  When your battery runs out, you
get *zero* benefit from the mesh.  Or even your local
device *sans network*.
The traffic-fraction and the extrapolation of Moore's 'law' are largely
for the next decade.  In fact, given that standby usage will *decrease*
to transmit usage only makes the relative proportions worse.  I don't
care if you use a picoamp on standby/listen, you'll still need a few
milliwatts to forward a packet.  Or more, if there are no nearby
cooperative nodes.
Sure, in the distant future, mobile power may so vastly dominate
power usage that meshes become practical.  (There's even
positive feedback, the more meshnodes the less transmit power.)
Meantime, uncompensated altruism is maladaptive.

Re-reading RAH's "if they pay me enough" reply, it is also right that a
price can be set on the wattage you've sherpa'ed, perhaps so that you
can pay off your usage of said mesh
by letting others use your batteries.  And the micropayments will be
feasible thanks to
real cheap info + crypto, what RAH's undiagnosed brain tumor labels

even depend on the wattage you have left.  Your phone will negotiate

As a Web master to several Islamic organizations, Mr. Hussayen helped to
maintain Internet sites with links to groups that praised suicide
bombings in Chechnya and in Israel. But he himself does not hold those
views, his lawyers said. His role was like that of a technical editor,
they said, arguing that he could not be held criminally liable for what
others wrote.
Civil libertarians say the case poses a landmark test of what people can
do or whom they can associate with in the age of terror alerts. It is
one of the few times anyone has been prosecuted under language in the
antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act, which makes it a crime
to provide "expert guidance or assistance" to groups deemed terrorist.
"Somebody who fixes a fax machine that is owned by a group that may
advocate terrorism could be liable," said David Cole, a Georgetown
University law professor who argued against the expert guidance part of
the antiterrorism law this year, in a case where it was struck down by a
federal judge.

Gist: they can spread too fast to deal with unless you throttle all
Science, Vol 304, Issue 5670, 527-529 , 23 April 2004
COMPUTER SCIENCE:
 Technological Networks and the Spread of Computer Viruses
 Justin Balthrop, Stephanie Forrest, M. E. J. Newman, Matthew M.
 Computer viruses and worms are an increasing problem throughout the
world. By some estimates 2003 was the worst year yet:
 Viruses halted or hindered operations at numerous businesses and other
organizations, disrupted cash-dispensing machines,
 delayed airline flights, and even affected emergency call centers. The
Sobig virus alone is said to have caused more than $30
 billion in damage (1). And most experts agree that the damage could
easily have been much worse. For example, Staniford et al.
 describe a worm that could infect the entire Internet in about 30 s
(2). A worm of this scale and speed could bring the entire
 network to a halt, or worse.
 The term virus refers to malicious software that requires help from
computer users to spread to other computers. E-mail
 viruses, for instance, require someone to read an e-mail message or
open an attached file in order to spread. The term worm
 refers to infections that spread without user intervention. Because
they spread unaided, worms can often spread much faster than
 viruses. Computer infections such as viruses and worms spread over
networks of contacts between computers, with different
 types of networks being exploited by different types of infections. The
structure of contact networks affects the rate and extent of
 spreading of computer infections, just as it does for human diseases
(3-7); understanding this structure is thus a key element in
 the control of infection.
 Both traditional and network-based epidemiological models have been
applied to computer contagion (3-5). Recent work has
 emphasized the effects of a network's degree distribution. A network
consists of nodes or vertices connected by lines or edges,
 and the number of edges connected to a vertex is called its degree. Of
particular interest are scale-free networks, in which the
 degree distribution follows a power law, where the fraction pk of
vertices with degree k falls off with increasing k as k- for some
constant . This structure has been
 reported for several technological networks, including the Internet (8)
and the World Wide Web (9, 10).
 Infections spreading over scale-free networks are highly resilient to
control strategies based on randomly vaccinating or otherwise disabling
vertices. This is bad news
 for traditional computer virus prevention efforts, which use roughly
this strategy. On the other hand, targeted vaccination, in which one
immunizes the highest degree
 vertices, can be very effective (11, 12). These results rely crucially
on the assumption that the degree distribution follows a power law, and
also that the contact
 pattern is static.
 Many technological networks relevant to the spread of viruses, however,
are not scale-free. Vaccination strategies focusing on highly connected
network nodes are
 unlikely to be effective in such cases. Furthermore, network topology
is not necessarily constant. In many cases the topology depends on the
replication mechanism
 used by a virus and can be manipulated by virus writers to circumvent
particular control strategies that we attempt. If, for instance,
targeted vaccination strategies
 were found to be effective against viruses spreading over scale-free
networks, viruses might be rewritten so as to change the structure of
the network to some
 non-scale-free form instead.
 To make these ideas more concrete, we consider four illustrative
networks, each of which is vulnerable to attack: (A) the network of
possible connections between
 computers using the Internet Protocol (IP), (B) a network of shared
administrator accounts for desktop computers, (C) a network of e-mail
address books, and
 (D) a network of e-mail messages passed between users.
 In network A, each computer has a 32-bit IP address and there is a
routing infrastructure that supports communication between any two
addresses. We consider
 the network in which the nodes are IP addresses and two nodes are
connected if communication is possible between the corresponding
computers. Many
 epidemics spread over such an IP network. Notable examples include the
Nimda and SQLSlammer worms.
 Network B is a product of the common operating system feature that
allows computer system administrators to read and write data on the
disks of networked
 machines. Some worms, including Nimda and Bugbear, can spread by
copying themselves from disk to disk over this network.
 Network C has nodes representing users and a connection from user i to
user j if j's e-mail address appears in i's address book. Many e-mail
viruses use address
 books to spread (for example, ILoveYou). A closely related network is
network D, in which the nodes represent computer users, and two users
are connected if
 they have recently exchanged e-mail. Viruses such as Klez spread over
this network.
 Degree distributions have been measured for examples of each of the
four networks (see the figure). In network A, all vertices have the same
degree, so the
 distribution has a single peak at this value (blue histogram). In
network B, the distribution consists of four discrete peaks, presumably
corresponding to different
 classes of computers, administrators, or administration strategies (red
                                       Infectious connections. (Left)
Degree distributions for the IP (blue) and administrator (red) networks.
                                       administrator network data were
collected on a system of 518 users of 382 machines at a large
                                       Computers in this network are
connected if any user has administrative privileges on both computers.
                                       Cumulative degree distributions
for the e-mail address book (blue) and e-mail traffic (red) networks.
The e-mail
                                       address book data were collected
from a large university (7). The e-mail traffic data were collected for
                                       e-mail activity of a large
corporate department over a 4-month period (18).
 The two e-mail networks have more continuous distributions and are
shown as cumulative histograms. Although neither network has a power-law
degree distribution,
 both have moderately long tails, which suggests that targeted
vaccination strategies might be effective. However, calculations show
that for network C, about 10% of
 the highest degree nodes would need to be vaccinated to prevent an
epidemic from spreading (7), whereas network D would require about 80%.
The first of these
 figures is probably too high for an effective targeted vaccination
strategy, and the second is clearly far too high. (Targeted vaccination
would be entirely ineffective in
 the other two networks as well, because the nodes are much more highly
 The two e-mail networks illustrate the ways in which different virus
replication strategies can lead to different network topologies. An
e-mail virus could look for
 addresses in address books, thereby spreading over a network with a
topology like that of network C, or it could search through other files
or folders on the machine
 for addresses of senders and recipients of archived e-mail messages,
giving a topology more like network D. Another example is provided by
the Nimda virus,
 which infects Web servers by targeting random IP addresses, producing a
network like network A. However, if the virus had a more intelligent way
of selecting IP
 addresses to attack (e.g., by inspecting hyperlinks), then it might
spread over a topology more like that of the Web, which is believed to
have a power-law degree
 distribution (9, 10).
 A control strategy is needed that is immune to changes in network
topology and that does not require us to know the mechanisms of
infections before an outbreak. A
 number of methods have been proposed (13). One such strategy is
throttling, first introduced for the control of misbehaving programs
(14) and recently extended to
 computer network connections (15). In this context, throttling limits
the number of new connections a computer can make to other machines in a
given time period.
 Because it works by limiting spreading rates rather than stopping
spread altogether, the method does not completely eliminate infections
but only slows them down.
 Frequently, however, this is all that is necessary to render a virus
harmless or easily controllable by other means (16).
 Throttling is most effective when viruses generate traffic at a rate
significantly higher than normal network communications. Luckily this is
true for many common
 protocols and the viruses that exploit them (15, 17). For a virus to
spread, it needs to propagate itself to many different machines; to
spread quickly, it must do so
 at a high rate. For example, the Nimda worm attempts to infect Web
servers at a rate of around 400 new machines per second, which greatly
exceeds the normal
 rate of connections to new Web servers of about one per second or
slower (15).
 A throttling mechanism that limited connections to new Web servers to
about one per second would slow Nimda by a factor of 400 without
affecting typical
 legitimate traffic. This could easily be enough to change a serious
infection into a minor annoyance, which could then be eliminated by
traditional means. Slowing the
 spread of Nimda by a factor of 400 (from a day to more than a year)
would have allowed plenty of time to develop and deploy signatures and
prophylactic software
 patches. (Of course, if throttling were implemented on only a subset of
the nodes in a network, then infections could spread more easily.) In
addition to reducing
 virus spread, throttling has the practical benefit of reducing the
amount of traffic generated by an epidemic, thus reducing demand on
networking equipment--often
 the primary symptom of an attack.
 Targeted vaccination strategies for the control of computer viruses are
unlikely to be generally effective because the networks over which
viruses spread are not
 sufficiently dominated by highly connected nodes, and because network
topology can be influenced strongly by the way in which a virus is
written. Throttling
 provides a promising alternative strategy that works with any network
topology and can greatly reduce viruses' impact by slowing their spread
to the point where
 they can be treated by conventional means. The disparity between the
speed of computer attacks (machine and network speed) and the speed of
manual response
 (human speed) has increased in recent years. If this trend continues,
automated mechanisms like throttling will likely become an essential
tool, complementing the
 largely manual approach of software patching in use today. The idea of
rate limits is not specific to viruses, and could be applied to many
situations in which an
 attack or cascading failure occurs faster than possible human response.

Consumer Report: Part 2 - Problems with GEMS Central Tabulator
                                Submitted by Bev Harris on Thu,
                                08/26/2004 - 11:38. Investigations
                                This problem appears to demonstrate
                                intent to manipulate elections, and
                                was installed in the program under the
                                watch of a programmer who is a
                                convicted embezzler.
                                According to election industry
                                officials, the central tabulator is
                                secure, because it is protected by
                                passwords and audit logs. But it turns
                                out that the GEMS passwords can easily
                                be bypassed, and the audit logs can be
                                altered and erased. Worse, the votes
                                can be changed without anyone knowing,
                                including the officials who run the
                                election.
                                Multiple sets of books
                                (Click "read more" for the rest of
                                this section)
                                The GEMS program runs on a Microsoft
                                Access database. It typically recieves
                                incoming votes by modem, though some
                                counties follow better security by
                                disconnecting modems and bringing
                                votes in physically.
                                GEMS stores the votes in a vote
                                ledger, built in Microsoft Access. Any
                                properly designed accounting program
                                will allow only one set of books. You
                                can't enter your expense report in
                                three different places. All data must
                                be drawn from the same place, and
                                multiple versions are never
                                acceptable. But in the files we
                                examined, we found that the GEMS
                                system contained three sets of
                                "books."
                                The elections official never sees the
                                different sets of books. All she sees
                                is the reports she can run: Election
                                summary (totals, county wide) or a
                                "Statement of Votes Cast" (totals for
                                each precinct). She has no way of
                                knowing that her GEMS system uses a
                                different set of data for the detail
                                report (used to spot check) than it
                                does for the election totals. The
                                Access database, which contains the
                                hidden set of votes, can't be seen
                                unless you know how to get in the back
                                door -- which takes only seconds.
                                Ask an accountant: It is never
                                appropriate to have two sets of books
                                inside accounting software. It is
                                possible to do computer programming to
                                create two sets of books, but dual
                                sets of books are prohibited in
                                accounting, for this simple reason:
                                Two sets of books can easily allow
                                fraud to go undetected. Especially if
                                the two sets are hidden from the user.
                                A hidden trigger The data tables in
                                accounting software automatically link
                                up to each other to prevent illicit
                                back door entries. In GEMS, however,
                                by typing a two-digit code into a
                                hidden location, you can decouple the
                                books, so that the voting system will
                                draw information from a combination of
                                the real votes and a set of fake
                                votes, which you can alter any way you
                                see fit.
                                That's right, GEMS comes with a secret
                                digital "on-off" switch to link and
                                unlink its multiple vote
                                tables. Someone who tests GEMS, not
                                knowing this, will not see the
                                mismatched sets of books. When you put
                                a two-digit code into a secret
                                location can you disengage the vote
                                tables, so that tampered totals table
                                don't have to match precinct by
                                precinct results. This way, it will
                                pass a spot check -- even with paper
                                ballots -- but can still be rigged.
                                How and when did the double set of
                                books get into GEMS?
                                Black Box Voting has traced the
                                implementation of the double set of
                                books to Oct. 13, 2000, shortly after
                                embezzler Jeffrey Dean became the
                                senior programmer. Dean was hired as
                                Vice President of Research and
                                Development in September 2000, and his
                                access to the programs is well
                                documented through internal memos from
                                Diebold. The double set of books
                                appeared in GEMS version 1.17.7.
                                Almost immediately, according to the
                                Diebold memos, another Diebold
                                programmer, Dmitry Papushin, flagged a
                                problem with bogus votes appearing in
                                the vote tables. The double set of
                                books remained, though, going through
                                several tweaks and refinements. From
                                the time Jeffrey Dean was hired in
                                September, until shortly before the
                                Nov. 2000 election, GEMS went through
                                over a dozen changes, all retaining
                                the new hidden vote tables.
                                For four years, anyone who has known
                                how to trigger the double set of books
                                has been able to use, or sell, the
                                information to anyone they want.
                                Black Box Voting Associate Director
                                Andy Stephenson has obtained the court
                                and police records of Jeffrey Dean. It
                                is clear that he was under severe
                                financial stress, because the King
                                County prosecutor was chasing him for
                                over $500,000 in restitution.
                                During this time, while Jeffrey Dean
                                was telling the prosecutor (who
                                operated from the ninth floor of the
                                King County Courthouse) that he was
                                unemployed, he was in fact employed,
                                with 24-hour access to the King County
                                GEMS central tabulator -- and he was
                                working on GEMS on the fifth floor of
                                the King County Courthouse. (Dean may
                                now be spending his nights on the
                                tenth floor of the same building;
                                after our investigations appeared in
                                Vanity Fair and the Seattle Times,
                                Dean was remanded to a work release
                                program, and may be staying in the
                                lockup on in the courthouse now.)
                                Jeffrey Dean, according to his own
                                admissions, is subject to blackmail as
                                well as financial pressure over his
                                restitution obligation. Police records
                                from his embezzlement arrest, which
                                involved "sophisticated" manipulation
                                of computer accounting records, report
                                that Dean claimed he was embezzling in
                                order to pay blackmail over a fight he
                                was involved in, in which a person
                                died.
                                So now we have someone who's admitted
                                that he's been blackmailed over
                                killing someone, who pleaded guilty to
                                23 counts of embezzlement, who is
                                given the position of senior
                                programmer over the GEMS central
                                tabulator system that counts
                                approximately 50 percent of the votes
                                in the election, in 30 states, both
                                paper ballot and touch screen.
                                And just after he is hired, multiple
                                sets of books appear in GEMS, which
                                can be decoupled, so that they don't
                                need to match, by typing in a secret
                                2-digit code in a specific location.
                                Dr. David Jefferson, technical advisor
                                for California voting systems, told
                                Black Box Voting that he could see no
                                legitimate reason to have the double
                                set of books in a voting program. He
                                surmised that it might be incredible
                                stupidity.
                                Dr. Jefferson should speak to Jeffrey
                                Dean's partners and those who worked
                                with him. "Stupid" is not how he is
                                described. The descriptions we get,
                                from Dean's former business partner,
                                and from others who worked with him,
                                are "sophisticated," "cunning," "very
                                bright," "highly skilled," and "a con
                                man."
                                This is the man who supervised the
                                programming for GEMS when the multiple
                                set of books was installed. Diebold,
                                however, is the company that did
                                nothing about it.
                                Internal memos show that Dean was sent
                                the passwords to the GEMS 1.18.x files
                                months after Diebold took over the
                                elections company. Diebold clearly did

                                exposing this problem in 2003, Diebold
                                still failed to correct it.

Consumer Report: Part 3 - More GEMS problems, and why current
solutions / explanations won't work
                               Submitted by Bev Harris on Thu,
08/26/2004 - 11:33. Investigations But do new security measures solve
the problem?
                               The MS Access database is not
passworded and can be accessed illicitly through the back door simply
by double-clicking the vote file. After we published this report, we
observed unpassworded access on the very latest, GEMS 1.18.19 system
in a county elections office.
                               Some locations removed the Microsoft
Access software from their GEMS computer, leaving the back door intact
but, essentially, removing the ability to easily view and edit the
                               However, you can easily edit the
election, with or without Microsoft Access installed on the GEMS
computer. As computer security expert Hugh Thompson demonstrated at
the Aug. 18 California Secretary of State meeting, you simply open any
text editor, like "Notepad," and type a six-line Visual Basic Script,
and you own the election.
                               Some election officials claim that
their GEMS central tabulator is not vulnerable to this back door,
because they limit access to the GEMS tabulator room and they require
a password to turn on the GEMS computer.
                               However...
                               (Click "read more" for the rest of this
                               Any county that uses modems to transfer
votes may inadvertently be giving control of the entire central
tabulator to anyone who gets at the computer through the modem phone
lines (even if it is NOT attached to the Internet). This allows
Diebold, or any individual, to manipulate votes at their leisure, from
any personal computer anywhere in the world.
                               Let's talk about getting at the central
tabulator through telephone lines: Mohave County, Arizona, for
example, has six modems attached to its GEMS computer on election
night. King County, Washington has had up to four dozen modems
attached at once.
                               You will hear that the GEMS machine is
stand alone, and is never connected to the Internet. It does have an
Internet component, called "jresults," but nowadays most counties say
that they do not hook GEMS up to the Internet. They say that they
remove the disk from the GEMS computer and physically take it to
another computer, from whence the Internet feed comes. Very nice --
                               You can access a computer through phone
lines as well as through the Internet. In fact, famous hacker Kevin
Mitnick liked to hack through telephone lines, not the Internet.
                               If you have the dial-in numbers, it is
possible to get at the GEMS computer from anywhere, using RAS. The
dial-in protocols are given to poll workers, many people in Diebold
have them, lots of temps have them, and the configurations have been
sitting on the Internet for several years.
                               What if your county doesn't use any
modems at all? That's excellent, but here's what we found: Harris &
Stephenson visited county elections officials to ask for lists of
names. We asked who was allowed to access the central tabulator, after
it was already turned on, and who is given a password and permission
to sit at the terminal?
                               Several officials told us they don't
keep a list. Those who did, gave us the names of too many people --
County employees (sometimes limited to one or two). Diebold
employees. Techs who work for the county, like county database
technicians, also get access to GEMS. Printshops who do the ballots
have some access also.
                               Diebold "contractors," who are
temporary workers hired by subcontractors to Diebold were also
reported to have gained access to the GEMS tabulator. (Diebold
accounts payable reports obtained by Black Box Voting indicate that
Diebold advertises for temps on Monster.com, hotjobs.com, and uses
several temporary employment firms, including Coast to Coast
Temporary, Ran Temps Inc, and also works with many subcontractors,
like Wright Technologies, Total Technical Services, and PDS Technical
                               What if there is a password even to get
onto the GEMS computer itself?
                               There usually is. The problem is this:
Once that computer is open and running GEMS (on election night, for
example), that password doesn't much matter. Votes are pouring in
pell-mell, and they aren't about to shut that computer down until
hours later, sometimes days later.
                               Also, Black Box Voting found another
problem with the design of GEMS: Check out the Audit Log, which is
supposed to record everything that happens. In every database, you
find everyone logging is as the same person, "admin."
                               There is a reason for this. We did not
find a way in GEMS to log in as a new user unless you close GEMS and
reopen the file. Now who, on election night, with votes pouring in, is
going to close and reopen the file? They don't. Instead, everyone
calls themselves the same name, "admin," thereby ruining the audit log
(which can be easily erased and changed anyway.)
                               What about counties that limit access
to just one person, the county elections supervisor?
                               We've found nowhere that actually does
this. The reason: Elections officials are dependent on the vendor,
Diebold, during the election.
                               Suppose we have a computer whiz county
official who is the ONLY person who can access GEMS?
                               Unlikely, but if you do: "Trust, but
verify." We should never have to trust the sanctity of a million votes
to just one person.
                               The following things can be done when
you go in the back door in GEMS using Microsoft Access:
                               1) You can change vote totals.
                               2) You can change flags, which act as
digital "on-off" switches, to cause the program to function
                               According to internal Diebold memos,
there are 32 combinations of on-off flags.  Even the programmers have
trouble keeping track of all the changes these flags can produce.
                               3) You can alter the audit log.
                               4) You can change passwords, access
privileges, and add new users.
                               Let's talk about passwords
                               How many people can have passwords to
GEMS? A sociable GEMS user can give all his friends access to the vote
database. We added 50 people, and gave them all the same password,
which was "password" -- so far, we haven't found a limit to how many
people can be granted access to the election database.
                               Election meltdown:
                               We found that you can melt down an
election in six seconds, simply by using the menu items in GEMS. You
can destroy all data with two mouse clicks, and with four mouse
clicks, you can destroy the configuration of the election making it
very difficult to reload the original data.
                               Does GEMS even work as advertised?
According to testimony given before the Cuyahoga Elections Board, the
Microsoft Access database design used by Diebold's GEMS program
apparently becomes unstable with high volume input. This problem,
according to Diebold, resulted in thousands of votes being allocated
to the wrong candidate in San Diego County in March 2004.
                               The Audit Log
                               Britain J. Williams, Ph.D., is the
official voting machine certifier for the state of Georgia, and he
sits on the committee that decides how voting machines will be tested
and evaluated. Here's what he had to say about the security of Diebold
voting machines, in a letter dated April 23, 2003:
                               "Computer System Security Features: The
computer portion of the election system contains features that
facilitate overall security of the election system. Primary among
these features is a comprehensive set of audit data. For transactions
that occur on the system, a record is made of the nature of the
transaction, the time of the transaction, and the person that
initiated the transaction. This record is written to the audit log. If
an incident occurs on the system, this audit log allows an
investigator to reconstruct the sequence of events that occurred
surrounding the incident.
                               Since Dr. Williams listed the audit
data as the primary security feature, we decided to find out how hard
it is to alter the audit log.
                               We went in the front door in GEMS and
added a user named "Evildoer." We had Evildoer perform various
functions, including running reports to check his vote-rigging work,
but only some of his activities showed up on the audit log. When we
had Evildoer melt down the election, by hitting "reset election" and
declining to back up the files, he showed up in the audit log.
                               No matter. It was a simple matter to
eliminate Evildoer. We went in through the back door and simply
deleted all the references to Evildoer.
                               Microsoft Access encourages those who
create audit logs to use auto-numbering, so that every logged entry
has an uneditable log number. Then, if one deletes audit entries, a
gap in the numbering sequence will appear. However, we found that this
feature was disabled, allowing us to write in our own log numbers. We
were able to add and delete from the audit without leaving a trace.
                               Could the double set of books be
                               From a programming standpoint, there
might be reasons to have a special vote ledger that disengages from
the real one. For example, election officials might say they need to
be able to alter the votes to add provisional ballots or absentee
ballots.  If so, this calls into question the training of these
officials. If election officials are taught to deal with changes by
overwriting votes, regardless of whether they do this in vote ledger 1
or vote ledger 2, this is improper.
                               Also, if it was legitimate, it would be
a menu item in the GEMS program, not executed in a hidden location
triggered by a secret 2-digit code. Nothing in the GEMS documentation
describes the use of any feature like this whatsoever.
                               Here's why we need to involve CPAs in
vote tabulation regulations, procedures, and design:
                               If changing election data is required,
the corrective entry must be made not by overwriting vote totals, but
by making a corrective entry.
                               It is never acceptable to make changes
by overwriting. Data corrections should not be prohibited, but must
always be done by indicating changes through a clearly marked line
item that preserves each transaction.
                               However, according to elections
officials we interviewed, GEMS is improperly designed, and cannot
perform an adjustment, and you can't journal changes that occur for
weird reasons that really happen. (For example, a poll worker might
accidentally run ballots through twice. You need to be able to correct
this and still show your work.)
                               Instead of doing an adjustment and
showing the explanation, retaining a permanent record of everything
that happened, a common procedure is to wipe out the mistake, and
simply overwrite it with new data. This is completely improper, from
an auditing standpoint.
                               It is certainly improper to have the
summary reports come from the second ledger, while pulling the spot
check reports from the first ledger, with a provision in the back door
to allow these two ledgers to be mismatched.
                               But there is more evidence that these
extra sets of books are illicit: If the extra set of books is
legitimate, the county officials, whose jurisdiction paid for and own
the voting system, should be informed of such functions. Yet Diebold
has not explained to county officials why it is there at all, and in
most cases, never even told them these functions exist.
                               As a member of slashdot.org commented
when we originally published this information: "This is not a bug,
it's a feature."

Get your head around that one.
The infectious biological "attack" will be an accident of the modularity

farm.  It will not be intentional but it will kill a lot before the
can be produced, which takes ca. 6 mos..  See 1918 pandemic,

but it won't be intentional.  The geopoli implications will be fun, but
UBL is not involved there.
A non-infectious biological attack (eg anthrax which isn't
infectious) is cheap, but not Al Q's preferred MO.  They go
for the special effects type attacks, simultaneous so you
know its them.  (Otherwise it could be a suicical egyptian,
a rudder jerked too hard, a screw-jack improperly lubricated,
the NTSC is very creative.)
Of course the Ft Detrick folks enjoy sending

A chem attack is pretty nifty, and in many ways easier than

Again, the Mosaic approach of repeated asymmetric attacks on the Pharoah

NUMBER THEORY:
 Proof Promises Progress in Prime Progressions
 Barry Cipra
 The theorem that Ben Green and Terence Tao set out to prove would have
been impressive enough. Instead, the two
 mathematicians wound up with a stunning breakthrough in the theory of
prime numbers. At least that's the preliminary assessment
 of experts who are looking at their complicated 50-page proof.
 Green, who is currently at the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical
Sciences in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Tao of the
 University of California (UC), Los Angeles, began working 2 years ago
on the problem of arithmetic progressions of primes:
 sequences of primes (numbers divisible only by themselves and 1) that
differ by a constant amount. One such sequence is 13,
 43, 73, and 103, which differ by 30.
 In 1939, Dutch mathematician Johannes van der Corput proved that there
are an infinite number of arithmetic progressions of
 primes with three terms, such as 3, 5, 7 or 31, 37, 43. Green and Tao
hoped to prove the same result for four-term
 progressions. The theorem they got, though, proved the result for prime
progressions of all lengths.
 "It's a very, very spectacular achievement," says Green's former
adviser, Timothy Gowers of the University of Cambridge, who
 received the 1998 Fields Medal, the mathematics equivalent of the Nobel
Prize, for work on related problems. Ronald Graham, a combinatorialist
at UC San Diego,
 agrees. "It's just amazing," he says. "It's such a big jump from what
came before."
 Green and Tao started with a 1975 theorem by Endre Szemerédi of the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Szemerédi proved that arithmetic
progressions of all
 lengths crop up in any positive fraction of the integers--basically,
any subset of integers whose ratio to the whole set doesn't dwindle away
to zero as the numbers get
 larger and larger. The primes don't qualify, because they thin out too
rapidly with increasing size. So Green and Tao set out to show that
Szemerédi's theorem still
 holds when the integers are replaced with a smaller set of numbers with
special properties, and then to prove that the primes constitute a
positive fraction of that set.
                                       Prime suspect. Arithmetic
progressions such as this 10-prime sequence are infinitely abundant, if
a new proof
                                       holds up.
 To build their set, they applied a branch of mathematics known as
ergodic theory (loosely speaking, a theory of mixing or averaging) to
mathematical objects called
 pseudorandom numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random,
because they are generated by rules, but they behave as random numbers
do for certain
 mathematical purposes. Using these tools, Green and Tao constructed a
pseudorandom set of primes and "almost primes," numbers with relatively
few prime
 factors compared to their size.
 The last step, establishing the primes as a positive fraction of their
pseudorandom set, proved elusive. Then Andrew Granville, a number
theorist at the University of
 Montreal, pointed Green to some results by Dan Goldston of San Jose
State University in California and Cem Yildirim of Bo_gaziçi University
in Istanbul, Turkey.
 Goldston and Yildirim had developed techniques for studying the size of
gaps between primes, work that culminated last year in a dramatic
breakthrough in the
 subject--or so they thought. Closer inspection, by Granville among
others, undercut their main result (Science, 4 April 2003, p. 32; 16 May
2003, p. 1066),
 although Goldston and Yildirim have since salvaged a less far-ranging
finding. But some of the mathematical machinery that these two had set
up proved to be
 tailor-made for Green and Tao's research. "They had actually proven
exactly what we needed," Tao says.
 The paper, which has been submitted to the Annals of Mathematics, is
many months from acceptance. "The problem with a quick assessment of it
is that it
 straddles two areas," Granville says. "All of the number theorists
who've looked at it feel that the number-theory half is pretty simple
and the ergodic theory is
 daunting, and the ergodic theorists who've looked at it have thought
that the ergodic theory is pretty simple and the number theory is
 Even if a mistake does show up, Granville says, "they've certainly
succeeded in bringing in new ideas of real import into the subject." And
if the proof holds up? "This
 could be a turning point for analytic number theory," he says.

the heart to fibrillate, typically 100-200 J for an adult,
during a certain critical window during the sinus rhythm.
Our gizmos discharge ~200 uF at up to 2 KV to defibrillate
a fibrillating heart, which will also fibrillate if administered to a

a defibrillator the person is dead, CPR or not.

                           device that allows them to patrol much larger
areas with fewer sets of eyes,
                           many civil libertarians view surveillance
cameras as a creeping erosion of
                           privacy rights.
                           "How would you like to be followed around by
a slimy guy in a raincoat
                           who records everything you do? It's a
technological version of a slimy guy
                           in a raincoat," said privacy expert Lauren
Weinstein, who is producing a
                           radio series about technology's impact on
                           "The difference is, you can't see it, you
don't know what it's pointed at, or
                           how long the images are going to be stored."
                           The mostly unregulated recording takes place
with a tacit nod from the U.S.
                           Supreme Court, which has indicated again and
again that people have no
                           reasonable expectation of privacy in public
                           Government agencies across the United States
are installing cameras in as
                           many public areas as possible, but they are
still behind the curve compared
                           with European cities, Ramos said.
                           In Los Angeles, surveillance devices
increasingly are used by government
                           to patrol public places. Several recently
installed cameras along Hollywood
                           Boulevard scan stretches popular with
tourists and criminals alike.
                           And, buoyed by the success of a surveillance
program at crime-plagued
                           MacArthur Park west of downtown, the LAPD
recently unveiled a camera
                           system capable of scanning thousands of
license plates per hour and
                           employing controversial facial-recognition
software to pinpoint known
                           criminals.
                           Once clunky and obtrusive, some surveillance
devices are now so small
                           they're nearly undetectable. And the days of
scratchy, black-and-white
                           images recorded on videotape are long gone.
Advances in technology
                           mean crystal-clear digital pictures that can
be reviewed in real time -- as
                           they occur.
                           "These are beautiful tools," said Ramos,
whose company sells 20 to 30
                           surveillance systems each month. "It's the
ability to be anywhere in the
                           world and see what's going on, and also
review what happened yesterday,
                           or last week, or last month."
                           Although the cameras raise the hackles of
privacy advocates, most people
                           don't mind being recorded everywhere they go,
said A. Michael Noll, a
                           communications professor at the University of
Southern California.
                           Graduate students polled about privacy issues
routinely rank surveillance
                           cameras nearly at the bottom of a long list
of concerns, he said.
                           "Most people just don't care about being on
camera," Noll said. "In Los
                           Angeles, they probably enjoy it. They
probably see it as a screen test."
                           Northridge resident Rochelle Matthews sees it
as an invasion of privacy.
                           The 37-year-old insurance agent said she
doesn't like being under constant
                           scrutiny.
                           "What are they looking for? I don't think
everything needs to be patrolled.
                           People need and deserve privacy."
                           Chatsworth resident Leanne Vince said she
doesn't mind being recorded
                           when she ventures out in public. Only
criminals need to worry about being
                           under surveillance, the 35-year-old music
company executive said.
                           "It doesn't bother me at all because I'm not
doing anything wrong," she
                           said. "If I'm at the grocery store and
they're following me, so what? It's
                           technology. You take the good with the bad."
                           But Weinstein cautioned that constant
surveillance can cause the shadow
                           of suspicion to fall on the innocent when
innocuous activities are
                           misinterpreted.
                           "A lot of people don't care, but they haven't
thought about it," he said.
                           "The dark side of this stuff isn't
                           The benefits of surveillance cameras, such as
capturing Oklahoma City
                           bomber Timothy McVeigh on film just before he
picked up the rental truck
                           used in the bombing, far outweigh the privacy
concerns, Noll said.
                           And the concerns of those "screaming about
Big Brother" may be
                           overblown, Noll said.
                           "If someone were tracking me down the street,
I might care," he said. "But
                           there aren't enough people at the other end
to be watching all this
                           surveillance."
                           Armed with that knowledge, experts are now
developing software that
                           alerts authorities when certain types of
behavior are detected.
                           Weinstein cautioned that the practice of
recording people in nearly every
                           public place could escalate out of control.
                           "It's always a balancing act," he said. "It's
not to say you have a total
                           expectation of privacy in public places, but
there shouldn't be none.
                           "Unless we want to live in a pervasive
surveillance society where all of
                           your moves are tracked and recorded, we'd
better start putting rules in
                           place."

A CP is not an anarchist; and anarchists are ill defined by current
authors, since the word merely means no head, rather than no rules,
as Herr May frequently reminded.
(In fact, the rules would de facto be set by the local gangster, rather
a DC based gang claiming to be the head.  A better form is libertarian
archy, but that is perhaps another thread.)
A CP, removing arguable claims about political idealogy,
is one who understands the potential effects of certain
techs on societies, for good or bad.  And is not, like
a good sci fi writer, afraid to consider the consequences.
And, ideally, a CP is one who can write code, and does so,
code that might be useful for free sentients, not even
necessarily free (in the beer sense) code.  (Albeit 'tis hard to
write useful code in the uninspectable sense of not-free,
and inspectability facilitates beer-free copying )
But this is an ideal, and perhaps three meanings of "free" in
one rant is too many for most readers.
