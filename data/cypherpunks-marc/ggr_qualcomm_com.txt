You also didn't address the point that the user's copy of the auditable data is no longer accessible to the user, making a mockery of the audit Your rebuttal lacks substance. The issue is loss of control and accountability.

Well, the bank's and the users' interests are only *mostly* aligned. The user really wants to be able, in the case of some strange disagreement, to take the application to a disassembler and show that it occasionally transfers twice as much money as it is supposed to, and show that its own records note such transfers. Under Palladium, the user loses the ability to audit either the program itself or the program's static data. In theory, this doesn't matter, but in practice...
I agree that all of the other protections can be provided by proper OS-level security, and don't need Pd. So again, Pd just takes that burdensome self-protection ability away from the user.

If they could do that reliably, they wouldn't need the toll thingy, nu? I have been told by someone in the photo-enforcement industry that their reliability is only around 75%, and they're very expensive, and ... anyway, not a viable solution to the problem given the current economics. But to a weekly commuter over one of the bridges in New York, for example, it's $1000 per year.
Until recently, when viruses and worms started to be used to assist spamming, what incentive did a miscreant have to invade hundreds or thousands of computers?

No, it was on the compression function, but not in any sense "reduced". But you had to start with particular values of the chaining variables, and in practice no-one knows how to do that, so MD5 (as a whole) isn't broken by this, at least until tomorrow evening. The rumour here is that MD5, HAVAL, and RIPE-MD are all goners. We know SHA-0 is toast too. There might also be results against SHA-1. Hash functions are hard.
And the reason you haven't heard any progress from Dobbertin is because his employers told him to either stop working on it, or stop talking about it, depending which version of the story you've heard. Since he works for the German NSA-equivalent, I guess he would take this seriously.

@_subject: RE: MD5 collisions? 
If I've understood it correctly, the answer is "sort of". For a given input, it seems that there is some non-trivial chance that the input+delta would produce the same hash, that is, a 2nd preimage. But the probability, for any single arbitrary message, might be quite low (especially since you'd have to multiply the probabilities of success for the first and second blocks; see my other message just before this one). But it seems to me that that probability would still be much better than the 2^-n that it should be for an n-bit hash.
For example, the MD5 collision in 2^40 work is really two separate near-collisions, each taking a bit less than 2^40 work. If you apply the deltas to a random message M, both blocks at the same time, it seems to me that the probability of success is about 2^-80; it either works or it doesn't. But that 2^-80 is a much better chance than you would have had for two random messages (which is really message M and a random delta).
But I could also be mistaken on this.

@_subject: Re: MD5 collisions? 
This, too, is overly simplistic an explanation. Doing it like this would effectively multiply the work for the near-collision in the first block and the correction in the second block, which is not what you want. To be efficient, you need to divide-and-conquer; make random pairs of first blocks until you find a pair that have the right very small difference in their chaining outputs. Then, from those first blocks, try to find second blocks that work. This adds the amounts of work, rather than multiplying them.
Apologies for any confusion.

In the light of day and less inebriated, I'd like to clarify some of what I wrote last night, and maybe expand a bit. My original account wasn't what I'd like to think of as a record for posterity.
This was not meant as a criticism. It just meant you had to concentrate really hard. Her English is much better than my Chinese.
As mentioned previously, the idea is to produce a good "partial collision" with the first blocks input to the hash, and then from two similar starting points, find subsequent blocks that correct them back to the same output. So, for a given input chaining vector, it takes about an hour to get the partial collisions in the first input block. From there, they can compute subsequent "second blocks" to produce the collisions in a few minutes.
Note that they did two entirely new collisions for MD5 overnight, communicating back to China, when they found out about the endianness problems. No-one can now argue that they can't find collisions at will.
With further hindsight, and Phil Hawkes' help, I understand now. The technique needs to alternate between single bit (xor) differences and subtractive differences, with careful conditioning of the bits affected to make sure the right carries do, or don't, propagate. This is explained in Phil's upcoming paper about SHA-2 cancellations, which was presented later in the rump session. That should be on e-print in the next couple of days. The Chinese team is also writing a much more detailed paper, but it will take longer.
There has been criticism about the Wang et. al paper that "it doesn't explain how they get the collisions". That isn't right. Note that from the incorrect paper to the corrected one, the "delta" values didn't change. Basically, if you throw random numbers in as inputs, in pairs with the specified deltas, you should eventually be able to create your own MD5 collisions for fun or profit. How they got this insight, we'll have to wait for... but the "method" is already there.

Eli Biham -- has collisions on 34 (out of 80) rounds of SHA-1, but can extend that to probably 46. Still nowhere near a break.
Antoine Joux -- his team announced the collision on SHA-0 earlier this week. There is concentration on the so-called "IF" function in the first 20 rounds... f(a,b,c) = (a & b) ^ (~a & c). That is, the bits of a choose whether to pass the bits from b, or c, to the result. The technique (and Eli's) depends on getting a "near collision" in the first block hashed, then using more near collisions to move the different bits around, finally using another near collision to converge after the fourth block hashed. This took 20 days on 160 Itanium processors. It was about 2^50 hash Xiaoyun Wang was almost unintelligible. But the attack works with "any initial values", which means that they can take any prefix, and produce collisions between two different suffixes. The can produce the first collision for a given initial value in less than an hour, and then can crank them out at about one every 5 minutes. It seems to be a straightforward differential cryptanalysis attack, so one wonders why no-one else came up with it. The attack on Haval takes about 64 tries. On MD4, about 4 tries. RIPE-MD, about 2 hours (but can improve it).  SHA-0 about 2^40 (1000 times better than Joux).
Xuejia Lai clarified that the paper on E-print has been updated with correct initial values. They were initially byte-reversed, which they blamed on Bruce Schneier.
