What would stop somebody from lying about his phone being broken? Are the
peers in the network should be his close friends or people that know him in
the physical world?

@_subject: Offst - A decentralized credit card 
Hi, I just published the first preview release of Offst.
Offst is a decentralized payment system based on mutual credit. It's an
open source project, written in Rust, licensed under AGPL3.
You can find the release notes and more information here:

At this point Offst is only a bunch of command line tools, but I think some
of you can already experiment with it. Criticism and ideas are welcome!

@_subject: A plan for Offst mobile app 
Hey, Offst is a digital credit card, powered by trust between people. It is
an open source project, licensed under AGPL3.
So far the main development on Offst was focused on designing a reasonable
open protocol, and on developing the core parts of Offst. One thing that
was neglected was a good graphical user interface.
I recently began on figuring out what an Offst mobile app would look like,
and so I sketched an initial draft for what the user flow should look like.
You can find it here:
Any ideas are highly appreciated!
