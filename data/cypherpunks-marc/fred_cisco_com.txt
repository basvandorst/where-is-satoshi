I may have it wrong. My source is a talk given along with renesys-030502-NRC-911.pdf to a NAE committee writing  The author told us that there were two class five switches in one of the towers and one in a neighboring building; the neighboring building was damaged by debris from the tower.

But Len Kleinrock adamantly disputes it.
To survive an EMP, electronics needs some fancy circuitry. I've never worked with a bit of equipment that had it. It would therefore have to have been through path redundancy.

Urban legend, although widely believed. Someone probably made the observation.
You mean, like drop a couple of trade towers and take out three class five switches, causing communication outages throughout New England and New Jersey, and affecting places as far away as Chicago?
Nope. Couldn't happen.
More seriously, yes, one could in fact take out any connectivity one wants by withdrawing routes (which is reportedly what Egypt did), and if you hit enough interchange points that could get serious.
At the risk of sounding naive and pollyanna-ish, we have a few more of those interchange points in the US than they have in Egypt. In theory, yes. Making it actually happen could be quite an operation.
