This is, roughly, how traditional Unix password security works. Reverse-engineering the encryption may or may not be possible, and   ought not to matter if you have used a strong enough method and long enough keys. And anyway, if this is running on the client machine then they already have a program that can do the work. What is possible is brute-forcing by encrypting the whole dictionary and trying every word one by one.
If your algorithm is strong enough, your key long enough, and above all if the space from which the plaintext is taken is large enough, than this sort of approach can be made sort of safe enough for most applications. But why bother?

That really is worth saying more often.
If we here can't agree on how to make machine voting  both robust and private, then  EVEN IF A PERFECT SYSTEM COULD BE DESIGNED it is extremely unlikely that a large number of people could be persuaded that it /was/ perfect.
So if public confidence in the mechanisms of voting is considered desirable, no electronic or digital system is viable.
 > You can run an algorithm on any subset of codes, including just
 > your own,
you already lost 94% of the electorate.  They are saying "huh?" and going back to whatever they were doing before the election rudely interrupted them.
Current electoral systems work - where they do - because the officials keep their hands above the table, and because members of opposing  political parties co-operate in snooping on each other, because it is in their interest to do so.
This adversarial system not only works (sort of, most of the time, in jurisdictions where the local law enforcement isn't entirely in the hands of one sector of society) but it can be made to appear to work (well enough to satisfy that minority of voters who seem to care)
And leaving aside the ritual invokation of gas ovens and 747s, this nasty socialist agrees with the burden of Tim's rant - if people don't want to vote what business is it of government to force them to vote?
If someone doesn't want to vote, that's their choice, and a tiny increment to the tiny portion of influence possessed by those of us who do vote.  So no skin of our noses. If all of you zombies give up voting than the rest of us get to choose the government, for what its worth.
As for lotteries - you want to encourage stupid people to vote?
Public holidays for voting are as bad - they are likely to lead fewer people to vote of course - just as in every other public holiday those who get off work will head for the hills or the beaches or the bars or the sports stadiums (and why not if they want to?) and those who have to work anyway will be even busier than normal.
It is enough if registration is simple and open, if there are sanctions against employers/landlords/unions/political parties/thugs in general  preventing people voting,  and if there is a postal vote scheme for people who really can't make it on the day. Most countries don't even have all that yet (big chunks of the USA didn't not that long ago), why complicate things Ken Brown

It is not. Grass is stuffed full of all sorts of complicated chemicals that can cause confusion to creatures that chomp it. Not to mention nassty little silica crystals.
Lambs can eat grass because they are toughened and honed grass-killers, fitted by millions of years of evolution to survive everything the grass can throw at them.  And even then they only cope with some kinds of grass. When a cat eats grass it gets sick.
It doesn't take much intelligence to sneak up on a leaf, but it takes one hell of a digestive system to eat it.
Us mammals are downstream of a 200-million-year evolutionary race between ourselves and green plants - they evolve a new poison, we evolve to tolerate it. Then we put it in hot drinks. Why else do so many plant compounds have such powerful drug effects on animals?
At the time of writing there is no winner in sight.
It isn't impossible to imagine one side winning in the end though. The plants really did beat the bacteria way back in the Palaeozoic - wood is about the only living tissue that bacteria can't eat. Which is why there is so much coal around.  Fungi got the better of them later.
Democracy tries to get the majority of participants through to the next round of the game. Natural selection kills nearly everybody, nearly all the time. Which is why it is so effective. But, given the choice, I'll take democracy.

@_subject: Re: Is Matel Stalinist? 
Well, yes. Most big corporations are in effect constitutional monarchies. Decisions are made by bureaucrats  with some oversight or direction provided by the "king" (CEO in some places, significant shareholders in others). When it all goes totally pear-shaped owners (or more likely, the banks) step in.
Yes, but in practice a lot of big companies are just like that. Whatever the paper ownership decisions tend to be made by a few large corporate owners, often banks, insurance companies, pension funds and the like; themselves run by officers and managers who share interests with the managers who run the company they own. The situation is in some ways analogous to "it doesn't matter who you vote for: the government always gets in".   In most large corporations the chain of responsibility back to individual owners is so long and so flexible that there is little real control.
Small business is different of course. You make money or you go broke.  Very direct feedback.
Emotional reactions & gut feelings about this point are one of the things that make people happier with one political camp or another.
The state-socialism that you Americans call "liberal"  tends to be supported by people who feel that their governments are more responsive to their needs or wants than corporations are. Conservatives US-style libertarians are likely to feel happier with corporations than government.  The "anti-globalisation" crows and European-style left anarchists & old-style non-Marxist socialists dislike both equally.
If I was cynical, or a Marxist, I'd say that it has a lot to do with having money. People whose wealth makes up a larger share of the whole than their vote does are more likely to feel happy about corporations than  they are about representative government.
OK, it's before noon and I've only had one cup of tea, so I'm cynical.
Yes, but, it might be that a corporation makes more money for its owners by centralising and systematising and reducing the local autonomy of business units. It's a lot easier to manage a thousand identical stores than a hundred unique ones. So from "Tyler Durden's"'s POV there might be more responsiveness from an independent  store than a chain.
Though like you said, that doesn't seem to apply to books.  Might to food though.

Nothing like that happened in Botany Bay. Not even in Mel Gibson movies.  The transported prisoners were (almost all) transported for a term of years, often 7, and when it was over they were given return passage, or allowed to stay on in Australia. Most stayed - the worst thing about transportation was the passage, which killed more than the sentence did.
Any children they had were as much citizens (or rather free subjects of the crown) as anybody else.
While in Australia prisoners were mostly hired out to colonists (AKA "squatters"). There were strict rules about their treatment that were sometimes even enforced. The minimum standard for food and clothing in the rules were not only (much)  better than prisoners would have had in England or Ireland, but in fact better than many poor labourers could have found for themselves back home.  They often prospered and their children and grandchildren prospered mightily. Between about 1870 and the Great War Australia was probably the most prosperous country in the world, and working men's wages higher than anywhere else, including the USA.
Historically the transported prisoners and their immediate descendants were mostly supporters of Britain & the Empire. And of course there never was  a war of secession. In fact the Australians recently voted to keep the monarchy - though mainly due to lack of a convincing plan for what to replace it with.

Though sometimes I've felt I was being a bit stupid wandering alone at night through large public housing projects openly carrying 800 quids worth of video camera.
Back in the 1970s I was on a camping holiday in what was then Yugoslavia with a friend. We arrived in Rijeka in Croatia by bus, started walking off to see if we could find a camp sight, and by the time we realised we were walking out of town the wrong way it was too late & too dark to do anything about it. So we slept on a small mound just off the road we were on.
Next morning we saw that we were on what was basically a rubbish dump, overlooking the naval harbour, with a great view of all sorts of military activities. No-one seemed to be taking any notice of us though.
In 1990 I and some colleagues were visiting a Texaco office in Houston for a work-related meeting. In the carpark we began to take some pictures of each other with the office building as background. The carpark attendant came up and demanded we stop insisting that there no photographs could be taken of the building.
Not even an industrial location, just a high-rise office building in a Houston suburb (Bellaire), in full & close view of the street, some other commercial buildings,  and dozens, if not hundreds, of private homes, and distantly visible to thousands - possibly hundreds of thousands - of people every day.
Crazy authoritarianism. Rules for the sake of rules. They exist to show who is boss. Like school uniforms or corporate dress codes - the rule is made not to enforce any desirable behaviour but to show who is where in the the hierarchy, who is able to make rules and who has to obey them.

Maybe the causality runs the other way. People who are more "left-wing" (whatever that exaclty might mean) are more likely to enjoy living in cities.
Over here in Britain that certainly seems to have happened. There's a churn in city populations as young adults move in to study or get jobs, then move out to suburbs or small towns later.
Some stay, and they tend to be the ones who are less politically Sometimes I think that political conservatives just don't *like* people as much.   I mean that quite literally - my most right-wing friends  are less greagarious than my left-wing friends. They keep themselves to themselves more.  They stay in doors more and when they are out they are more likely to stick to their own cars. They don't like travelling in public transport, or going to noisy pubs. They seem to actively dislike social situations where they rub up against large numbers of strangers.
And the Anarchists have the best parties. By which I mean Euro-style left-wing Sovcialist Anarchists of course, not grumpy American survivalist Libertarians.  "Get off my land!" is a characteristic right-wing stereotype. "Whose round is it anyway?" is not.  Like the old song says "As soon as this pub closes, the Revolution starts!"
In Britain, things may be different in your country, inner-city life is in many ways more old-fashioned than country life or suburban life.
Us city dwellers are more likely to walk to work or school, less likley to drive. We're more likely to use public transport. When we buy things we go to small corner shops and the shop-keepers might even know us. They might not know our names,  or even speak our language, but they probably recognise our faces.
For some time now (in England, things may be different elsewhere)   city-dwellers and inner-suburbanites have been more likely to go to church than people in the country or outer suburbs. London is the only part of Britain where churchgoing has gone up in the last ten years  (though its everywhere lower than anywhere in the USA - consistently less than ten percent)
Now teh last census tells us that one-parent families are rarer in London than in the country or in smaller towns. (See last week's Economist magazine  - full text available only to subscribers)
Also the proportion of people employed by government is smaller in London than the national average, and the proportion of self-employed or small businesses is greater.
Another thing US has in common with UK - large cities are net contributors to tax reevenues.

So that can't be the reason for Chinese stagnation.  QED.

OK, I wouldn't have expected you to have heard of Uthman dan Fodio and the Fulani Jihad, but you really ought to have some distant rumour of Muhammad Ahmad the so-called Mahdi, a generation or two earlier than the fall of the Turkish Empire. ()If only because it would be rather hard to make any sense of whats going on in North Africa without)
Sometimes I wonder if the would would be a better place if most Americans learned anything about history that happened east of New Bedford or west of the San Andreas fault.  Or that hadn't been filtered through a right-wing journalese dumbing-down small-c-conservative  small-l-liberal consensus.
But some miracles are too much to hope for.

More commonly states defend the rich against the poor.  They are what underpins property rights, in the  sense of "great property" - until the industrial revolution that was mostly rights to land other people farm or live on. Every society we know about has had laws and customs defending personal property (more or less successfully) but it takes political/military power to defend the right to exact rent from a large estate, and state power to defend that right for thousands or millions of landowners.
The apposite current comparison is 9/11 the most notorious piece of private-enterprise violence in recent years, and the far more destructive  US revenge on Afghanistan and Iraq. Which was hundreds of times more destructive but hundreds of thousands of times more expensive, so far less cost-effective - but in a a war of attrition that might not matter so much. Of course the private-enterprise AQ & their friends the Taliban booted themselves into a state, of sorts in Afghanistan, with a little help from their friends in Pakistan and arguable amounts of US weaponry. Not that Afghanistan was the sort of place from which significant amounts of tax could be collected to fund further military adventures.
States can get usually get control of far larger military resources than private organisations, and have fewer qualms about wasting them.  Not that it makes much difference to the victims - poor peasants kicked off land wanted for oilfields in West Africa probably neither know nor care whether the troops who burned their houses were paid by the oil companies or the local government.

But in most places at most times the state is run at least partly by and for the rich and the owners of property and  supports and privileges their continuing private power.
And there are circumstances where private individuals send men with guns to attack you if you  cross them.    Quite a lot of them, from the feudal barons, to drug-dealers in modern cities, to   just about anywhere out of easy reach of the state's police.
And there are places where corporations do that as well. Even well-run respectable British or American corporations that have annual reports and  shareholder's meetings.
State power and private power are different but not distinct, and everywhere more or less mixed up with each other and involved with each other, and in most places the same sorts of people have both. Economic power is a kind of political power.

Which are easier to spam and less secure than smtp.
SMTP is p2p by definition, though you can use servers if you want.
SMS  *IS* email , just a different kind of email - and a less secure, more expensive kind, in which the infrastructure is more in the hands of the large companies that run it and less accessible to users installing their own protections.
as we can for smtp
I suspect you don't get much traffic. The beauty of a non-real-time store-and-forward system like smtp (or SMS, or oldstyle conferencing systems with off-line readers) is precisely that  it can be automated. I don't have to see mail I don't want.
A higher proportion of the snail-mail I get is junk than the email. In fact almost all of it is (& most of what isn't is bills :-( - usually already paid by the bank)  I throw more than half of my incoming paper mail in the bin unopened, and about half of what is left is just put in a cupboard in case I get into some dispute tithe the bank or the electric company or whoever.
A higher proportion of the landline phone calls I get are junk. At least 4 out of 5 calls, maybe 9 out of 10. Email is doing quite well.
 > the ISPs will start to charge people for
Why should they charge more for qa service which is not only cheaper for them to run, but has more competition and is harder to subvert? A serious proportion of the rootkits and so on that have been plaguing us for the last few years involves chat & instant messaging & so on.  I'd block it at the boundary firewall. People who use it should just learn how to use mail.  They'd get through more. Chat is for functional illiterates. Learn to read at adult speed and you'll prefer mail. Why should they put up with being limited to someone else's typing speed?
