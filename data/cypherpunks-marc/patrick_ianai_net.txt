I find it distressing when Network Operators are willing to encourage DDoS'ing of a site.  Any site.  Especially on an operational list, where politics are specifically prohibited.
You don't like Wikileaks, that's between you & Julian.  A DDoS affects the infrastructure of multiple networks, users, other websites, etc., etc.  Most people who read the last sentence thought to themselves that is beyond obvious.  It is a shame you do not understand it.
Put another way, perhaps you should take your own 230gr.

Neither does correlation. :)
But Jorge has a point.  If they wanted to help users get past their DNS problems, they could tweet for assistance, tweet their IP addy and ask to be re-tweeted, ask owners of authorities to set up wikileaks.$FOO.com to 'crowd source' their name, etc.
So at the very least, they are guilty of not being imaginative.
BTW: I personally doubt they are doing this for money.  But I don't have any proof of that either.

You are assuming many things - such as the fact bgp is used at all.
But yes, of course you have to ensure the attack traffic does not move when you get attacked or you end up with a domino effect that takes out your entire infrastructure.
Not just anycast.  I said distributed architecture.  There are more ways to distribute than anycast.
Not everything is limited to 13 IP addresses at the GTLDs, David. :-)

There is a variation on that theme.  Using a distributed architecture (anycast, CDN, whatever), you can limit the attack to certain nodes.  If you have 20 nodes and get attacked from a botnet China, only the users on the same node as the Chinese use will be down.  The other 95% of your users will be fine.  This is true even if you have 1 Gbps per node, and the attack is 100 Gbps strong.
I disagree.  Spoofed attacks have reduced because the botnets do not need to spoof to succeed in some attacks.  RPF is woefully inadequately applied.
For attacks which require spoofing, it is still trivial to generate 10s of Gbps of spoofed packets.
Quarantining end users sounds like a good idea to me.  But I Am Not An ISP. :)
The idea of auto-updates at the OS level like in iOS (as opposed to big-I "IOS") may be a solution for many people.  Supposedly OSX is going that route.  But there will be those who do not want to get their software -only- through a walled garden like iTunes.
Fortunately, the motivations do have some alignment.  The users who do not need full access to their machines are the ones who are more likely to get confused & infected, and the ones who want someone to "protect" them more, which makes OS-level auto-update more appealing.  So that may help, even if it is not a panacea.
Wish us luck!

Any other non-sequitors? :)

No idea.  However, I would not be the least bit surprised.  In fact, I =

"Mere conduit" defense.  (Please do not anyone mention "common carrier =
status" or the like, ISPs are _not_ common carriers.)
How do you "shut off" a Tor "account"?
Do you think if the police found out child pr0n was being served from a =
