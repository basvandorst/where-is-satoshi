This is technically incorrect.  As far as I know, the client update is
completely unrelated.
The logging functionality has been implemented in the mixes
themselves, otherwise you would be able to circumvent it by using a
different client.  The CVS commit occured on 2003-06-27.  Logging is
implemented this way: if the last mix in the cascade (which sees the
request in the clear) detects a suspicious request, it is logged
together with an ID.  The ID is transmitted (through the cascade) to
the first mix, which logs the ID and the IP address.  Combining the
two log files, it is possible to collapse the cascade and backtrack
the requests.  This exploits that TU Dresden operates both the first
and last mix in the Dresden--Dresden cascade (which is the only that
works reliably, AFAIK).
An employee of TU Dresden described this scheme in an interview with
Heise Online, a German online news site, back in October 2001.  He
announced an implementation within the next six months, but I don't
know at the moment if he was speaking for the JAP project as a whole,
or if he was just expressing his own ideas.
According to the news sources I have read, the court requested
surveillance based on the target IP address.  However, the source code
does not contain code to monitor specific (target) IP addresses, but
an elaborate URL screening facility, based on regular expressions.
Just by specifying ".*", it should be possible to log all requests
(and the corresponding IP addresses).  I don't know why the source
code doesn't implement the surveillance based on IP addresses, as the
court allegedly requested.
Note that this kind of target-based monitoring would be much harder on
the plain Internet unless the remote site is willing to cooperate.  A
broken anonymizer makes this type of surveillance quite easy.
The official declaration ("Selbstverpflichtung") of the mixes, which
promises that neither logging will be enabled nor backdoors will be
implemented, hasn't been updated either.
However, perhaps the JAP team at TU Dresden hadn't much choice.  I
haven't seen the court order, but I could imagine that they weren't
allowed to inform the users because it would have harmed the criminal
investigation.  Following the order while fighting it within the legal
system is perhaps a wiser choice than just resisting it (and thus
breaking the law yourself).  But I agree that it takes them awfully
long to update their web site, now that some information is public.
Finally, they could have avoided all the hassle if they hadn't
published the source code.  Why did they publish?  I don't believe
it's an accident.

Why is the U.S. government interfering with the publication of
security advisories if the corresponding software is being run

The German government funds the AN.ON project, but allowed for a great
deal of independence.  Naturally, this independence does not extend to
the law, thanks to separation of powers.  Now a judge has forced the
operators to implement a surveillance interface, which is possible
because of a design weakness.  But that's just the beginning of the
legal process.  The project has announced that it plans to fight, but
within the legal system.
Nobody forces you to use the German service if you don't trust the
operators or (thanks to recent events) German law enforcement.
No, it isn't.  Most countries with communication infrastructure have
laws that regulate law enforcement access.  This is not a "stupid
local law" issue.
Your country is eavesdropping foreign communication as well.

I fully agree, but there is a wide variety of voting schemes out there,
of varying complexity.  In a ballot with only very few options, your
proposal makes sense.  But in some cases, the complete description of a
vote doesn't necessarily fit onto an A4 paper sheet.  Our own municipal
elections are so complicated that you fill in your votes at home and
bring the paperwork to the election office.  In the U.S., some of the
simple votes are linked to dozens of plebiscites, and you'll have a hard
time to print that onto a small piece of paper, too.
But I can't see why computerized voting is so important.  Here in
Germany, the pencil-and-paper method is doing just fine.  Volunteers do
the counting, so there is no monetary incentive to automate this
process.  It means that we have to wait a few hours (or even days, in
case of the municipal elections) before preliminary official results are
available, but this doesn't seem to be a significant problem, IMHO.
However, I'm sure our own paper-based voting system would fall apart if
subjected to the same scrutiny as Diebold's voting machines.  It's just
a different kind of insecurity.

Those that perform actual cryptographic operations can store tens of

reach 2**15 bits.  These tags (for example, MIFARE) are usually not
considered RFID tags by privacy activists, even though they can be
