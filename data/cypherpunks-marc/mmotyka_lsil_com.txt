If you're running an open source OS on one of the machines under test

Alternatively, you could probably just add a 3rd party to the setup and

TV Tuner, Graphics engine, TV out. There is XFREE86 support and there is
a project that has video capture working but no matter where I looked I
couldn't find technical docs for the thing. Isn't that where most driver
projects begin? It's what I've always stared with anyway. So I called
their Developer Support number and was told, in spite of the talk about
Linux support on the website, that they don't give that technical
reference out to just anyone but that some information had been released
to the Linux community. I have yet to locate exactly what was released.
I know it does not include the register set description for the TVout
portion and having seen SW DCT code in project sources I wonder if the
HW is being put fully to use. A HW DCT makes a huge difference in
performance. The net effect is that Linux development is hobbled. Is
this because ATI is protecting some sort of IP?
Anyway it kind of ticks me off.
So there's more, I'm pretty suspicious of BIOS and MS OS snoopiness.
Wouldn't it be nice to have open source BIOS? There is a Sourceforge
project called FreeBIOS and a cousin called LinuxBIOS. Again, I like to
start with documentation. Well the motherboard mfr offers little in the
way of technical info. Same for the chipset mfr. Unless you're a
corporate customer.
I don't really have a lot of time to reverse engineer this shit but I'm
just about mad enough to make time.

Abraham Lincoln :
"Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can
exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their

overthrow it." President Abraham Lincoln, "First Inaugural Address" (available at
 "Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the
right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new
one that suits them
better. This is a most valuable,---a most sacred right---a right, which
we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. Nor is this right
confined to cases in which the
whole people of an existing government, may choose to exercise it." (Speech in the United States House of Representatives, Jan. 12, 1848) As far as I am concerned, to the extent that a government restricts
speech against it, it betrays its weakness and strengthens the

I'm not buying Ashcroft's tricks or Nomen's. I'll stick with the simple
interpretation of the motivations and goals of those who question the

the Bush administration and John Ashcroft as Constitutionally

fork in the road, take it", have we taken it? And if so which path?
The fork analogy may be too simple. The natural path for a vital culture
is the crypto-anarchist path. The path of increasing state control is
the natural path for the maintenance and accumulation of power. We all
see the forces in operation, it's pretty much the topic 24/7. I think
the forces that bind this mess together increase with distance, the more
free the net becomes the greater the perceived threat and the desire to
reign it in. The tighter the controls the greater the desire to break
free. On each side there are those for whom compromise is unacceptable.
In the middle are the nearly oblivious masses who can with varying
degrees of success be swayed one way or the other from time to time.
Fear seems to be their main motivator.
Rather than making a choice and following any single path we are
following two concurrent and divergent paths and the energy level is

moving their kids to this school and suggested we take a look. First the
facts, then my conclusions. The facilities are nice and shiny new, there appears to be some decent
equipment. Every kid gets a laptop with an 802.11 card. All reading and
homework is done on the laptop. Needless to say it is all MS SW. There
is no library at the school, it is essentially a book-free zone - shades
of "Right to Read". My 3rd grader looked at the math that the 6th
graders were doing and said "we already did that." My 4th grader, said
"it's going to be boring."
My conclusions : appearances are more highly valued than content. The
school building where my kids go now is older, there are more hispanic
kids there but their teachers, whom I've met, are doing a reasonable job
- one, in particular, seems quite alive. The quicker kids were placed at
that particular school I think to raise the average test scores. I think
the parents like the newer schools because of their class perceptions :
they don't want their kids around the poorer minorities and are willing
to sacrifice academics. There may be some practical safety
considerations to that sentiment as the kids get older.
Remember the Monty Python Meaning of Life movie? The hospital
administrator who was absolutely fucking clueless as to what medicine

I think there is other wierdness that goes along with the USPS :
something about price minimums for certain types of mail carried by the
likes of FedEx and UPS. Protective pricing structures.
I grew up a in a fairly rural area. We all put up our own mailboxes on
posts. Every winter the damn plow knocked them over. Some went for brute
force, heavy pipe set in concrete, others for more elegant angled
pivoting supports. IIRC when you put up a mailbox ( paid for with your
own $ ) it becomes property of the USPS. What about the old-fashioned mail slot on the front door? Illegal to
possess now?
Why don't the trailer park folk do the following :
Update everyone's mail boxes. There will be two slots in the lid :
one labelled "US Mail" the other labelled "Private Mail"
label the bucket "Private Property - No Trespassing"
Let the law come down hard on anyone who puts mail through the US Mail
slot without postage.
The whole thing sounds truly stupid and about par for the course.

it have to pass some set of statistical tests to be random? If a string

the hits are  nutritional, wine, historical and military science items. This gem is from Canada :
I especially like the prohibition against observation towers.
Apparently that state has determined that its people will live in

need for the state to whack them arise.

Interestingly, wireless equipment could be used to make networks that

Hi Steve,
Did you try to follow their site?
I love the bit on the website about "make 40% blah blah blah" by buying
these colorful bad boys in volume at $6 each.
The indexing of these things to Ag is truly fucked (
 ). Apparently a $10 Liberty Dollar is
redeemable for 1oz of Ag which is today about $4.50. If silver goes over
$10 then they'll reset things to a $20 base. Er..what? I guess I didn't
study enough mathematics.
How the fuck are you going to make 40%? Especially in light of the sorry
fact that if you're dumb enough to buy these little buggers it's going
to be tougher'n'hell to find someone even more dumb to sell them to at a

it was a private enterprise or a slinking leo. The fucking ISP up in
Davis never returned my calls.

I guess bifurcation points and speciation seem very clear because of the aliasing problems in our sampling methods. The speciation exists but is prolly ( probably ) often fuzzier than we think. Almost everyone would say that an American Bison and a Scot's Highland are two different species but they can hybridize. Maybe we non-Biologists measure the distance between "species" inaccurately.
Choose your measure : population? power? innovation? environmental impact? rate of The US seems more vital by some measures. Less so by others. More dangerous to the species by others.  That is interesting.
Is the evolution towards a more efficient language an active or passive process? Is it driven by an internal inclination towards expansion, freeing up system resources as it were, or is it a coping mechanism for sensory overload?

If I remember correctly, right after the WTC attack one of the grocery chains, I think it was Safeway, immediately offered it's customer lists to the FBI. What were they going to do profile people who bought excessive amounts of chick peas, garlic and lemons?
Albertson's has recently returned to the stupid card but I notice that there is a checkbox that says you do not wish to give personal information. Fine. Of course you then lose the fantastic benefit of possibly having lost car keys returned via your friendly neighborhood grocery.
It's all marketing bull with the added benefit of of contributing to that giant database in the sky.

I know the experience -  in the southern US, in Scotland - it's all English. Really? People are probably creating language constantly like a software evolutionary experiment. Much of it probably dies out. What remains appears to be "speciation". Write much Forth lately?

Harmon Seaver That's about what I've seen.
There's probably an X10 module that would let your Linux box cycle the power on your modem/router/switch. try $50 : If you're not using a domain name then your script could publish your IP address on your home page ( in the clear or not as you choose ).
