Probably moving out of the domain of the crypto list.
volatile, like const, is a storage-class modifier.  As written, it
means a pointer to memory that is volatile; this means, in particular,
that you can't optimize away dereferences.  If you wrote
        char * volatile foo;
That means that foo itself is volatile, and you must fetch it from
memory whenever you want its value.
You might find the cdecl program useful...
    ; cdecl
    Type `help' or `?' for help
    cdecl> explain volatile void* vp
    declare vp as pointer to volatile void
    cdecl> explain void * volatile vp
    declare vp as volatile pointer to void
    cdecl> explain volatile void * volatile vp
    declare vp as volatile pointer to volatile void

But if the system is rooted, then the attacker merely has to find the
"today's secret word" entry in the registry and do the same thing.
Unless Windows is planning on getting real kernel-level kinds of protection.
See previous sentence. :)

The whole point is to enhance common practice, not stay at the lowest
common denominator.
You'd be wrong. :)  I did just download and use XCA for a little bit.
It's practically impossible to audit.  Every key in the database is
protected with the same password.  The system ask for the password
as soon as it starts up.  If I leave the program running while
I leave my computer, I'm screwed.  The key-holder isn't asked to
confirm each signing -- there's no *ceremony* -- and they never
enter the password after the program starts.  For any kind of root
these are all very bad.
XCA is pretty nice for a Level-2 or small Level-1 CA.  The template
management, etc., is pretty good.  (Having them tied to the key database,
and having the keys be unlocked while making cert requests, are both
real bad ideas, however.)

It's nice to have a GUI, but seeing phrases like
   For building the chains the CA flag is disregarded ...
doesn't make me feel very comfortable.  Also, there's no discussion of key
management, auditing, etc.  XCA is probably useful, but as a Level 1 CA,
not an enterprise root or management thereof.  Those are the points I
tried to address in the column.

Some folks here might be interested in

The context is using OpenSSL to build a PKI so that we can write an XKMS

A couple of years ago, I was told that *every* Canon laser engine
generated a unique microprint signature that could be traced back to a
particular device.  OEMs could buy the engine with or without the
signature.  If so, this has been going on, surruptitiously, for years.
