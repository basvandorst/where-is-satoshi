@_subject: Security co-processor keeps PC platforms safe 
"National Semiconductor has developed a novel PC security coprocessor
for securing data, authenticating users and checking the status of the
system's hardware."
The SafeKeeper PC21100 trusted platform module (TPM) is the first of
several National coprocessors with enhanced security functionality
that supports version 1.1 of the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance
(TCPA) security specification.
The SafeKeeper TPM provides protected storage of cryptographic and
sensitive data, authenticates a host computing device by verifying its
identity to other computing devices, and supplies metrics that provide
a reliable and trusted network environment.
It acts as a "root of trust" - a dependable block that can report the
security status of the rest of the system.
As it is hardware-based, it is not vulnerable to attacks like
conventional software-only solutions.
The SafeKeeper TPM is the most basic building block of the TCPA
security specification.
It is not accessible by the host CPU except through formalised methods
and is secured by industry standard cryptographic techniques.
The SafeKeeper TPM consists of a processor, memory, peripherals,
cryptographic accelerators and embedded firmware to implement the TCPA
security function.
"We have recognised the need for increased "trust" in PC platforms.
That's why we are working with industry partners and playing an active
role in the TCPA to enable trustworthiness in electronic
transactions", said Joel Christensen, marketing director of Intel's
desktop platform solutions division.
"SafeKeeper security technology puts hackers back where they belong -
on the outside, unable to get into your system", said Ulrich Seif,
chief information officer for National Semiconductor.

Hmmm, is that snake oil I smell?
