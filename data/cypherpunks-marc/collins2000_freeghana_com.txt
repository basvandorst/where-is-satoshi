It's my pleasure to bring to your notice that after my late father was murdered the liberian government siezed all my late fathers belongings hence i succeded in moving out of the country with the documnets of those precious stones since i am the only survival son of my family hence the next of kin was made in favour of my name for onbehalf of the entire family,
Moreso you should understand that due to the tesion that was impossed on me i am curently in london under the refugee camp to making sure that my life was safe Therefore i am making this contact to you based on the fact that i need to dispose those items that my late father deposited with security company in Ghana to enable me possition my life and look for something reasonable that i can establish with the money that i will realise after selling of those precious stones,
Please i would want you to confirm to me your interest to buying those precious stone hence i can forward to you the copies duplicates of the documents issued to my late father when he deposited the items with the security company,
Finally after negotiation on the price for selling then i will forward to you the copies of those documents if we can agree on the terms and conditions then we can arrange for facial meeting in Ghana to enable us conclude the transaction while i will hand over to you the precious stones that was been packed in trunk box .
