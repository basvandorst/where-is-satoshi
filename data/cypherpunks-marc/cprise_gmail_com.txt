And no reason why other hardware components can't do the same.
      So basically we are no longer using computers, but rather we now
      use computers-on-top-of-computers. Where the outer-computer is
      what we think we control with Qubes, etc, but the true
      inner-computers are the hardware components that can independently
      act like root privileged computers and directly pwn our entire
      system.
      Great. ;(
      WhonixQubes
    That's one way to interpret the situation, but I think that's
    pessimistic. We are lucky these techniques were exposed before they
    were put into widespread use (like the NSA's out-of-control phone
    and Internet monitoring).
    When I read the ARS article and the part about HD firmware, I
    thought: "Well, now the circle of trust really has whittled down to
    the CPU".
    The fact that NSA had to resort to HD firmwares to persistently keep
    some systems infected means that other aspects of PC architecture
    present big problems for them; Apparently going after the BIOS
    presents a lot of problems for an attacker (such as rendering the
    machine unusable).
    My second thought was: "Qubes is slated to have an untrusted storage
    domain, anyway."
