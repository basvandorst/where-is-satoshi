It's a bit more risky from a cryptography perspective, but provided your
wallet implementation is done correctly the extra risk is pretty much
theoretical. However this has caused real-world coin loss in the past in
the case of the Android PRNG flaw - re-using nonces in ECC signing
causes the private key to be revealed.
I think the real issue here is that John doesn't appear to have asked
any of the people whose signatures can release the funds if they were
willing to take part. If he had done that, he could have, and should
have, gotten separate pubkeys for the purpose of the bounty like was
done for Gregory Maxwell's CoinJoin bounty. Instead by not asking he is
in reality if not in theory placing demands on people who haven't
consented, particularly for the 1BTC bounty where he doesn't control any
of the private keys required to release the funds. IMO this is rude and
I encourage people not to do this.
Well, the issue with not disambiguating bounties is that if further
funds are sent to the bounty address it's unclear how do you handle
those funds. Note how he specified a specific txout for the 1BTC bounty,
but specified an address for the 4BTC bounty.
We're not that far off: I could cook up a Python script to do the
signature accumulation and signing in a few hours. There's just not all
that much demand yet to fully polish the UI's, and in any case, it'll
differ for every specific application.
FWIW blockchain.info added multisig escrow support ages ago, then
removed it not long after because usage was near zero.

Strong ACK on the basis of responding for forum trolls alone.
It's easy enough to make it a genuinely useful tool for multisig wallets
too: keep a copy of your Tor URL bookmarks on your second signing
computer. So long as either computer has the correct URL you're safe.

That's exactly why it's left open. If you find out after the fact that
you need to reprogram the firmware on a batch of USB devices you'll save
tens of thousands of dollars if you can do it by just plugging the USB
devices into a programmer via the USB port. They'll never bother adding
authentication to that programming backdoor because it's more work; they
don't have any market pressure to do it right because the schematics and
firmware are all closed source secrets.
Meanwhile the NSA can easily get access to schematics and firmware by
buying off employees and hacking into the computers of the people
designing them.
I dunno how to fix this. The best I can come up with is to make more of
these exploits happen - post anonymous bounties to get firmware and
schematics leaked?

IMO any change to the blocksize needs explicit mechanisms to let all
Bitcoin holders have a say in it.
Great! Glad to hear.
Are you thinking this more technical meeting should be before or after
the October event? Perhaps a better question, is what exactly do you see
being discussed at a technical meeting?

Great! They're excited to see this happen. I'm in London right now
actually for the conference they were holding this week; the blocksize
issue was being discussed a fair bit there among attendees. (notably,
with rather different views than seen on reddit!)
Yup, though keep in mind the regulatory question is more than just how
your local jurisdiction views Bitcoin, but rather how your customers'
jurisdictions view Bitcoin.
Of course, when I say "customers" above, I mean the entire Bitcoin
community that is ultimately buying the new coins produced by miners and
paying fees to them!

BTW it's worth working out how many $ in fees you need for a given
amount of MB worth of mempool.
At the current 10uBTC/KB minimim relay fee 1MB of txs requires just $2.5
worth of fees - kinda ridiculous when a block earns a miner $6250 in
revenue. Pretty much all txs pay significantly higher rates - more like
100uBTC/KB, or $25/MB. At that rate the 288MB max mempool size proposed
by Patrick Strateman's pull-req requires at least $7.2k worth of BTC to
fill to pay the fees, and in practice will probably quickly get higher.
See above - filling the mempool like that will be both a slow process,
and require lots of funds. Equally, once full, the sensible thing to do
is raise the minimum relay fee appropriately, so those transactions that
pay too low a fee will simply be rejected.
It'd be reasonable to tell peers that, and what the minimum fee needed
for acceptance would be for that particular node.
For an interactive, mobile wallet, the best thing to do is estimate the
fee correctly the first time, using RBF as a follow up mechanism only if
needed. For other users - e.g. exchanges handling customer withdrawals -
using RBF more agressively to get the minimum possible fee may make
In any case, the *existance* of RBF makes no difference to any of these
problems; RBF does make solving the easier. You can always choose to not
use it after all, resulting in the same "send-and-forget" process.
Having it available allows mistakes to be fixed after the fact, always
an improved user experience over not being able to re-bid for block
Incidentally, if my FSS-RBF bug bounty isn't collected in the next week
or two, we'll likely have a major double-digits % of hashing power
mining FSS-RBF soon after.

Have you looked at the fee estimation code in Bitcoin Core? I have no
reason to think it doesn't basically speaking work. Of course, SPV
wallets will need a semi-trusted third party to securely get that data,
but this seems to be a fundemental problem in a decentralized network -
the purpose of the blockchain itself is to prove that some data was
published to some audience, an analogous problem to proving to the SPV
wallet that their transaction actually reached miners and they actually
are considering it for inclusion.
Guaranteed reliable transaction processing is only possible in
centralized environments that can make service guarantees.
Few if any of those mechanisms can be deployed in a consensus-critical
way that is resistant to attack; the blocksize limit is needed to -
among other things - resist attacks by one miner on another to reduce
the competitors profitability. Without an explicit limit tx selection
and propagation rule changes can be gamed.

FWIW there Constance Choi and Primavera De Filippi (CC'd) are holding a
blockchain-tech conference October 14th-15th in Hong Kong as well;
coordinating your summit with that conference could be useful.
This workshop series has been attracting audiences of people looking to
use blockchain tech in general; many of these use-cases will likely
involve the Bitcoin blockchain in unpredictable ways. Importantly, these
ways can drive demand significantly beyond our current assumptions based
on most demand being consumer-merchant transactions.
In addition, many of the attendees have significant experience with
regulatory issues and interacting with governments on regulation of
blockchain tech. Bitcoin faces existential risks to its existence by
these regulation efforts, which include things like efforts to setup
industry wide Anti-Money-Laundering/Know-Your-Customer programs,
including programs that would tie on-chain transactions to identity
information. Any blocksize discussion needs to be informed by these
potential threats to usage of the technology, as well as challenges to
using scaling solutions.
Agreed. Pieter Wuille's recent work is a great example of the kind of
science-driven investigations that need to be done - and haven't been
done very much - to get us some hard data to make decisions on.
