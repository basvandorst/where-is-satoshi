Agreed that the ITU-T is a membership organization, but the Questions and Study Group work programs are open to view (Q. 17/13 specifically covers DPI, and has more documents coming down the pipe). If you want to follow some Question you can probably get access through your government (State Dept. in the US, Dept. of Communications in Canada). The membership rules don't apply so stringently to Rapporteurs' meetings, so you can get in touch with the Rapporteur of a Question you are interested in and find out where to get copies of documents contributed into those meetings.
All this is by the by -- you are more likely to be affected by the IETF than by anything coming out of the ITU-T.

I'm seriously not clear why Y.2770 is characterized as "negotiated behind closed doors". Any drafts were available to all participants in the ITU-T, on exactly the same terms as drafts of other Recommendations. As an example, the draft coming out of the October, 2011 meeting can be seen at  (I have access delegated by a vendor to whom I have been consulting, by virtue of their membership in the ITU-T.)
I should mention that the "Next Generation Network" within the context of which this draft was developed is more likely to be implemented by old-line operators than by pure internet operations.

You can look at the final outcome yourself (no password needed), at
RESOLUTION PLEN/5 on page 27 (by PDF count, out of 30 pages) describes work to be done by Study Group 3 and cooperating members. Note that the resolution is not part of the preceding treaty text.
