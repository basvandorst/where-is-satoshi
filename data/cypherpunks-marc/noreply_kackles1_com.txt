When seniors live alone or are sometimes without a caregiver for brief or extended periods of time, ADT Companion Services can help them stay active and enjoy more independent lives.
Hobbies, gardening, taking care of chores around the house - now they can have the freedom they want. Without changing their lifestyle.
An ADT® Companion Services® system can signal ADT to notify help with the push of your Help Button during medical emergencies, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service is suitable for seniors who live alone or are alone for long periods of time on a daily basis. By subscribing to ADT's Companion Services, you or a senior you care about can enjoy a more independent lifestyle.
