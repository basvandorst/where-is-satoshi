God helps those who help themselves.
Eavesdroppers hear no good of themselves.
God helps those who help themselves.
Two heads are better than one.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Enough is as good as a feast.
It'S an ill wind that blows nobody any good.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Laugh and the world laughs with you; cry and you are on your own..
Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
Penny wise, pound foolish.
Discretion is the better part of valour.
Laugh and grow fat.
The least said, the soonest mended it'S a long lane that has no turning discretion is the better part of valour make hay whilst the sun shines look before you leap don'T count your chickens before they hatch another man'S grass is always greener necessity is the mother of invention.
All'S well that ends well.
