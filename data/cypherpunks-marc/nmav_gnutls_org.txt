I think the issue here is more of procedure rather than individuals or
affiliations. Even if Mr. Igoe is no longer the co-chair the same
process could allow for intentional or unintentional mistakes. I believe
it is more important to improve the process of IRTF expressing its
opinion to IETF working groups rather than blame individuals or
organizations. For example, if the process would include a summary of
the discussion and the opinions of people involved it would be hard for
anyone communicating to misinterpret consensus or opinions.
I am also more comfortable as an outsider to have participants with
their NSA (or any other agency's) affiliation in the clear.
