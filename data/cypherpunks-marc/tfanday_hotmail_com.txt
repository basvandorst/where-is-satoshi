Attention: The President/CEO.
I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you to transfer to your overseas account a huge amount of money deposited in one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal. I urgently want to know you and if you are capable of handling and accomodate this magnitude of funds until i resign and come over to join you for an investment in your country. What i need is a reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit enough to provide either an existing bank account or set up a new Bank A/C immediately to receive this funds. Even an empty A/C can serve to receive this funds as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this interest.
I am Mr Tamba Fanday (Bsc,Msc,) the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in Dakar Senegal West Africa. During the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in our bank some years ago and till date no body has operated on this account. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner Mr. Daniel Thorp a contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation  died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January, 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan, Cote DIvoire. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. Finally, i discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in official documents of his numbered deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal amounting to Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars.
I need your full co-operation to move and secured this fund in an account in your country or as you may norminate because the management of the bank is ready to approve and release this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you upon your positive response. With my influence and my position in the bank, we can both arrange and the fund can officially be transferred to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide. I will personally arrange for every documents related to the transfer to be destroyed immediately we receive this money in your account leaving no trace to any place. At the conclusion of this business, I would want 20% of the amount involved  to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. If you are interested, please
