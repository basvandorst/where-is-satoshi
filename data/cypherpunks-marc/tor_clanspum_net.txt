Don't take this the wrong way; I hate the restrictions most US ISPs put on
their providers.  That said, actually, yes they do tell you.  Since you
agreed to their TOS when you signed up, they are free to enforce it.
Denying this possibility is just sticking your head in the sand.  Maybe
they won't ever bother you, but maybe they will.  They can tell you not to
run sshd, vpn servers, Tor, whatever.  They might even be able to tell you
not to surf porn from that connection, mattering on what their TOS looks
Like it?  No.  Live with it?  You have to, unless you find a provider that
sucks less.

Speakeasy.net is happy to let you use your connection.  They're also
significantly more expensive than your normal home-use DSL or cable.
Worth it?  Your call.
