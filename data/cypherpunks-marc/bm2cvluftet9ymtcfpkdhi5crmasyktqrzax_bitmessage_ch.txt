that, while the Tor devs may be doing their best, Tor is ultimately an
asset to the US Intelligence apparatus rather than a liability.
  The missing context here is that the NSA runs its own anonymity networks
because it doesn't trust community-run infrastructure.
  Some things are useful to the intelligence community.  Like phones.  And
cars.  And the Internet.  Why disregard a technology just because it might
be used by spies?
