You know everytime I hear of this on one of my forums it saddens me. I feel like we are a family and I enjoy talking..or in my case listening, to each of you daily.
 Mark, I hope they keep you in some capacity beacause of your vast knowledge. What the new, read pc metality, doesn't understand is we came up wiring boards, and improvising under harsh situations and we can do anything with anything. We are not "plug and play" .
Good Luck
