A fourth person was arrested and charged yesterday with helping the

Both civilians and officials seem to think that there is some magic
about a drivers license that would make it a good national ID and
requires that it be protected from misuse by unauthorized persons.
Apparently unknown to these worthies is the fact that terrorists,
criminals, or just plain folks can do anything they want to do without a
drivers license issued by a US state.

or internationally, get a job, start a business, rent accomodations,
open bank accounts, and do anything you like without a US drivers
Holders of foreign drivers licenses can drive in the US.
Among the four million US expats are many native born US citizens who
have an absolute right to enter, live, and work in the US but who do not
*currently* even have a right to obtain a US drivers license since they
are not *resident* in the US.  Any US citizens who care to can
characterize themselves as being in this group.
A drivers license issued by a US state is no more than evidence of
identity.  It is not evidence of right to reside in the US, right to
work in the US, etc.  One must use other documents to establish right to
reside and right to work (if those documents are required).  One can use
other documents to establish identity.  Including most significantly a
passport (whether foreign or domestic).
With 300 million US border crossings by aliens annually, it is clear
that plenty of aliens are travelling around the country almost none of
whom have drivers liccenses issued by a US state.
I hope that a "new, improved, drivers license" takes some of the heat
off the National ID concept.

Special agents should read the Economist in addition to NLECTC Law Enforcement & Corrections Technology News Summary The lemon dilemma
Oct 11th 2001
 From The Economist print edition
This year's Nobel prize for economics honours work inspired by a simple observation about used cars
This year's other two laureates, Michael Spence of Stanford University and Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia, won their prize for analysing how firms and consumers separate the gems from the lemons in a variety of industries.
Mr Spence's early work focused on how individuals use signalling to communicate their abilities in the labour market. Job applicants, for example, want to distinguish themselves from the mass of other hopefuls. They may try to do this in a number of ways, from a fancy suit to a fancy education. But for signals to be believable, Mr Spence observed, they need to differ substantially in their cost of acquisition. For example, for education to work as a credible signal, it must be harder for less able employees to get. Indeed, even if such an education gives a student no tangible skillsreading classics at Oxford, sayit can still be a useful signal of relative quality to employers.
Signalling is used in many markets, wherever a person, company or government wants to provide information about its intentions or strengths indirectly. Taking on debt might signal that a company is confident about future profits. Brands send valuable signals to consumers precisely because they are costly to create, and thus will not be lightly abused by their creators. Advertising may convey no information other than that the firm can afford to advertise, but that may be all a consumer needs to know to have confidence in it. Perhaps advertising, as a signal, is not money entirely wasted, as some economists argue.
It's all about signaling.

Like most of our legal discussions here, morality is not at issue just
what opinions courts have expressed on various matters.
The US was, in fact, convicted of war crimes in '86 in a trial at the
International Court of Justice for air-sown mines in Nicaragua but nothing
came of it.
US treatment of those who formally declared war on it a half-dozen times
since 1996 and initiated hostilities is not likely to constitute that
entity's worst human rights violations.  Perhaps not a rights violation at
all in strict libertarian terms.
Libertarian penal theory has not been well developed.  Naturally we don't
favor sticking prisoners in utopian socialist colonies (prisons).  Slavery
to the victim or family is possible but difficult.  "The Market for
Liberty" suggested that crime would be so rare that shrinks would rent the
few prisoners as study subjects but I doubt that's very realistic.
There's always the payment of wergeld but the poor often can't pay.
Since torture or execution are not strictly prohibited by the
non-aggression axiom in the case of those who have agressed, there are
likely to be differences among libertarians on the treatment of prisoners.

In fact burglary is generally treated as a more serious crime than mere theft (the taking and asportation of the personal property of another) because it involves invasion of the home (at Common Law).  Though legislatures have expanded burglary to include businesses and even cars at Common Law it was "the breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another with intent to commit a felony therein."  It is serious because one may be vulnerable (asleep) at home and anyone criminal enough to break into your home is probably capable of doing very bad things.  It's quite a major breach of the duty of peace that we owe others (who haven't done anything to us).

I'm trying to figure out the answer to what should be a simple
question.  Is it illegal to be Illegal.
I've wandered through various US Code sections:
TITLE 18 > PART I > CHAPTER 75 > Sec. 1546.
Sec. 1546. - Fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other documents
TITLE 8 > CHAPTER 12 > SUBCHAPTER II > Part V > Sec. 1253. Sec. 1253. - Penalties related to removal TITLE 8 > CHAPTER 12 > SUBCHAPTER II > Part VIII > Sec. 1325.
Sec. 1325. - Improper entry by alien
TITLE 8 > CHAPTER 12 > SUBCHAPTER II > Part VIII > Sec. 1324d.
Sec. 1324d. - Civil penalties for failure to depart
and it looks like there are the normal criminal penalties for forgery
and uttering a false document and a minor misdemeanor charge for
sneaking accross the border but merely a fine for overstaying a visa. If you fail to leave after you are ordered to do so you may be
imprisoned but the language is the language of "civil" penalties rather
than "crimes."
Is this correct?
I know that Illegals are usually just subject to deportation and that
this is a civil matter.  (Which is why all the detainees arrested after
September 11th don't have the right to a free lawyer since they are not
charged with any crimes.)
As far as any of you know, are there any "pure crimes" involved in
immigration other than those outlined above?
If not, this should be pointed out in arguments on the topic.

8)  One is not required to apply for a Social Security Number.
18) The machine-readable lines on your passport (at the bottom of the page that has your picture on it) include space for a National ID number.
21) It is not a crime to be an illegal alien in the US.  It is a civil matter.  It is a crime to use fraudulent documents to gain entry.

Worldcom didn't follow (GAAP) in accounting for expenses and concealed its true financial status.
Federal and state governments and their Special Purpose Entities (like Social Security) have never followed (GAAP) and regularly conceal their true financial status.
If private execs should do time for their lies and concealment so should our political leaders for their much more significant lies and concealment.

Gilmore v. Ashcroft -- FAA ID Challenge
AIR TRAVELER ID REQUIREMENT CHALLENGED
Secret rule demanding 'Your Papers Please' claimed unconstitutional
San Francisco - Civil libertarian John Gilmore today challenged as unconstitutional a secret federal rule that requires domestic US travelers to identify themselves.
Smooth move. Attempt to board a flight to DC on July 4th "to petition the government for redress of grievances". Even if not successful, it will be annoying and will be worthwhile if it manages to crack out copies of the secret security directives (like FAA SD 96-05)establishing the system.
Keep in mind that until the end of the first Clinton administration, it was perfectly legal to fly domestically without ID.

Sept. 11 Hijackers Said to Fake Data on Bank Accounts
Sayeth the New York Times:
      July 10, 2002
      Sept. 11 Hijackers Said to Fake Data on Bank Accounts
      By JAMES RISEN
      WASHINGTON, July 9  The Sept. 11 hijackers were able to open
      35 American bank accounts without having legitimate Social
      Security numbers and opened some of the accounts with
      fabricated Social Security numbers that were never checked or
      questioned by bank officials, a senior F.B.I. official said
      today.
      ...
      With no scrutiny from the financial institutions or
      government regulators, the hijackers were able to move
      hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Middle East into
      the United States through a maze of bank accounts beginning
      more than a year before their attacks.
      A spokesman for SunTrust, which is based in Atlanta, said the
      bank had been cooperating with the F.B.I.'s investigation.
      The spokesman said it was possible for foreigners without
      Social Security numbers to open bank accounts in this
      country, but he could not provide details of what forms of
      identification the hijackers used to open the SunTrust
      accounts.
      ...
      One of the first signs of a large infusion of cash coming
      into the United States for use by the hijackers appears in
      bank records dating from 2000, when $100,000 was deposited in
      bank accounts controlled by some of the leading hijackers,
      including Mr. Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, Mr. Lormel said.
      ...
Note that it is as legal as church on a Sunday for non-residents to open
financial accounts in the US or Switzerland or the UK etc. Many US banks
don't accommodate foreigners but that is because of sloth not law.
Certainly online brokers (who are quasi banks) do market to foreigners.
One reason that SS numbers were not verified is that the SSA has
traditionally refused to verify for privacy reasons and the alternative
method involves doing a credit check which takes time and money. And in
the case of non-interest-paying current accounts there are no tax issues.
Banks located in the "red states" are not as bureaucratic as banks in the
"blue states" and have been much slower to adopt the controls popular on
the coasts. This is changing of course but there are still many social
differences which make account transactions easier in the free states.
But let's assume for a moment that Homeland Security shuts the banks down
and requires verified DNA samples and licenses from 10 separate agencies
to open a financial account in the US. So the middle class Egyptians and
Saudis with no criminal records who attacked us are faced with the
ultimate challenge of getting the $500K they needed into the US.
By dint of heroic effort, the future highjackers manage to open bank
accounts in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. They receive ATM, debit, or credit
cards to draw on those accounts. Perhaps they encourage their French or
British co-conspirators to open accounts in those countries. They arrive
in the US and withdraw the $500 to $1000 per day maximum (per account)
from ATM machines. Assume they have only managed to open 5 accounts.
That's $2500 to $5000/day. Or 100 to 200 days to withdraw $500K. Not much
of a trick particularly since they are not limited to 5 accounts and can
get cash advances at any bank with any credit cards they have.
But then Homeland Security outlaws ATMs and credit cards (or at least the
international connections of same). This is tantamount to imposing
exchange controls which the US has never done. So the attackers have to
fall back on Krugerrands. At $333 a pop, they have to get 1500 KRs into
the country. Since bullion coins are not considered currency, they aren't
covered by financial instrument import reporting laws. But you can just
mail them one or two at a time. Most of them will get through. No big
The truth is that it's a bit tricky to block the movement of small
amounts of money like this.

Eric's comment are correct.
A bit more info.  The US wanted to devalue the $ and substitute a general
gold standard for a government to government gold standard.  The gold
standard price of gold was $20.67/ounce.  By forcing Americans to turn in
their gold before devaluation, the Feds got more gold for less money.
They also wanted the freedom to inflate.  Gold clauses were common in
contracts and they would have made soft money difficult.
As is traditional under US law, gold ownership was banned for US citizens
and permanent residents anywhere on earth.  There were controlled
exemptions for coin collectors, jewelers, and dentists.
Gold smuggling became popular during the Vietnam war and the monetary
crises of the '60s and '70s.
It was re-legalized in January of 1975 (the only decent act of the Ford

more internees but they'd be tough to hide. Too many others would note

Congressman Wants to Let Entertainment Industry Get Into Your Computer
      Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., formally proposed
      legislation that would give the industry unprecedented new
      authority to secretly hack into consumers' computers or knock
      them off-line entirely if they are caught downloading
      copyrighted material.
I've been reading things like this for a while but I wonder how practical
such an attack would be. They won't be able to hack into computers with
reasonable firewalls and while they might try DOS attacks, upstream
connectivity suppliers might object. Under current P2P software they may
be able to do a little hacking but the opposition will rewrite the
software to block. DOS attacks and phony file uploads can be defeated
with digital signatures and reputation systems (including third party
certification). Another problem -- Napster had 55 million customers.
That's a lot of people to attack. I don't think Hollywood has the troops.

Buying Trouble
In which the Village Voice discusses the use of commercial databases including supermarket discount cards in hunting terrorists.
One useful piece of advice:
Don't but pizza with a credit card:
Oddly enough, "one of the factors was if you were a person who frequently ordered pizza and paid with a credit card," Ponemon says, describing the buying habits of a nation of college students. "Sometimes data leads to an empirical inference when you add it to other variables. Whether this one is relevant or completely spurious remains to be seen, but those kinds of weird things happen with data."
Course all those terrorists buying their pizzas with cash get away clean.

A Faraday Cage for your EZPass:
EZPass is an Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system used in the
Northeast. A small white box is attached to your windshield and is
queried by radios in passing toll booths. Your account is debited for the
toll. Your account lists all the booths passed and when so it can be very
useful for law enforcement and civil attorneys (including domestic
relations lawyers). EZPass has already been featured on an episode of Law
and Order. In addition since the system is protected by weak or no
encryption, attackers with radios could extract some information by
querying your EZPass. Perhaps duplicating it to steal tolls from you.
The EZShield is a little box with a drawer to hold your EZPass. According
to the photo, it doesn't increase the EZPass form factor by much. What
you are supposed to do in open the drawer to expose your EZPass only when
you want to use it and keep it enclosed when you don't.
The interesting thing is that EZShield's sellers believe that there is
enough interest in a technological privacy fix that they are willing to
advertise it on mass media. I heard it just before the Rush Limbaugh show
on WABC in NYC.

      supervised release. Austin does not start his sentencing on
      Monday, but will find out the exact date at his court

Another one of those unfortunate chicken defendants we seem to get. He
would have got a max of 4-5 at trial. So now he has a felony conviction
anyway plus endless parole supervision which gives the Feds way too much
control over you. And he gives up a chance to challenge the "Publish Bomb

If you go to trial and lose and do your time you are then free of
supervision. Plus you never admitted any crime. A plea is an admission.
When you are in custody, your cooperation is the only thing you can deny
your captors.

Bookies in Exile
By WILLIAM BERLIND
Costa Rica is highly prized by the world's backpackers and sightseers for its unspoiled natural beauty, but it's easy to forget that when arriving in its grimy capital, San Jose. The newly remodeled airport is surrounded by chain hotels, freshly paved roads and shiny corporate plazas. After that it goes rapidly downhill. A dusty highway heading vaguely toward downtown takes you through the poorer suburbs of San Jose, packed with families in corrugated-tin-roof shacks. Above them, on the sides of the surrounding hills, Costa Rica's elite live behind high, fortified walls. The entire valley is blanketed with smog from auto fumes, brush fires and burned trash.
This Costa Rica doesn't make for much of a postcard, but to a small group of men, Americans mostly, it is alluring, enchanting and brimming with possibilities for adventure. The men are bookmakers taking bets and dispensing winnings over the Internet, and Costa Rica has exactly what they need -- a government that welcomes new investment in almost whatever form it takes, a well-developed business environment that makes it possible get phone lines hooked up and computer equipment serviced and a sizable English-speaking population capable of manning the phones and helping customers place their bets. Legal prostitution, as well as a plethora of strip clubs, seedy casinos and bars festooned with Budweiser signs, round out the atmosphere.
Betting operations are now among San Jose's most lucrative and visible enterprises, and their success has transformed the city. One prominent suburban landmark is an office building occupied by an outfit called BETonSPORTS.com. Throughout its nine floors, 1,500 Costa Ricans are employed (in mostly clerical positions) and offered amenities like on-site day care and classes to improve their English.
Most of the bookmaking companies, though, are a good deal smaller and harder to see, tucked away in strip malls and shadowy side streets. The American proprietors are generally in their 30's and 40's, and for them, the Internet provides not only the means to escape the reach of American law, but also a chance to turn what had been the equivalent back home of small, local shops -- sustained by personalized attention and all the headaches that involves -- into booming, virtual superstores that can rake in action from all over the world. The experiences of these men in Costa Rica, as well as of those elsewhere in Central America and the Caribbean, started out as thrilling adventures in what seemed to them like Las Vegas in the 1950's. But as betting operations multiplied, the offshore business has become hotly competitive and complicated. Worse, in recent years lawmakers and ambitious prosecutors back in the States have been mounting ever more serious legal challenges. Returning home to a normal life now means facing the possibility of going to prison. And so, many of the bookmakers who started out so optimistically are finding themselves locked into an isolated way of life that with each passing day seems a worse bet.
