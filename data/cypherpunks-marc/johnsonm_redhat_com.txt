Whatever else we do, I'm confident that updates for a beta channel
will not include written descriptions of errata.  Newer packages
will just show up in the channel.
You are essentially right that while there are components of the
process that are automated, intelligently populating a beta channel
is real work.  That said, don't expect even intelligently populated
beta channels to be BugFree[TM], you could see real brokenness come
through as we try things out.  It is, after all, as you point out,
a beta.  :-)

That would be a good bet.  :-)
Well, I won't promise, but putting updates from rawhide into RHN becomes
more interesting as we accumulate updates, and it *is* now on the agenda.
It wasn't something we were sure about ahead of time -- the main points
of the channel being there when we launched were to make sure that the
firstboot registration works, and to leave ourselves the option to use
it later for updates.  Expect channel population during this week.
(Modulo emergencies which by their very nature we won't be able to
comment on, blah blah blah.  :-)
