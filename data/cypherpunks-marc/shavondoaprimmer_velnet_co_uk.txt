A man who wanted to rest on the ground used a jar as a pillow. It was so
hard that he asked his servant to staff it with feathers to make it soft. A
pupil was talking about the recent fire in his school. "I knew it was going
to happen." he said, "Because we've been practicing for it all
year".Computer manufacturers are considering changing the instructional
words "Press Any Key" to "Press Return Key", because too many people have
been calling to ask where the "Any" key is.
Two neighbors had been fighting each other for nigh on four decades. Bob
buys a Great Dane and teaches it to use the bathroom in Bill¡®s yard. For
one whole year Bill ignores the dog. So Bob then buys a cow and teaches it
to use the bathroom in Bill¡®s yard. After about a year and a half of Bob¡®s
cow crapping in Bill¡®s yard; being ignored all the while, a semi pulls up
in front of Bill¡®s house. Bob runs over and demands to know what¡®s in the
18-wheeler. ¡®My new pet elephant,¡® Bill replies solemly.
