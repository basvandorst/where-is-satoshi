Just advertise for government grants on facebook, and have a random link
selected for follow thru. (or your favorite social site).

If there is any type of hardware that you need. (raid scsi, sata
controllers, disks) just let me know. I may even be able to get a hold of a
retired server.

Thanks for the links & design pointers. I'll willing to admit that I'm not
an expert, but always eager and willing to learn something new!
 [yes I know the lurker finally speaks...lol] I'll try yo keep this brief.
A little history about my background. I was born in the chicago area a dual
citizen (American/German[Transylvanian]), from good stock. Ingenuity,
design, art, music, and sciences, are some of the traits I share with my
family & relatives.
I studied electrical engineering for 3 years in high school (graduated
early), then 2 more in college before switching into the computer network
field. While in college I worked at the sba patent office, reviewing
patents and researching designs.
Going back a little further, when I was a kid I ran a small repair shop,
fixing tv's stereos, etc (anything with cord or ran on batteries). I had a
real knack for fixing broken electronics so they wouldn't break again.
In the early 80's I got interested in computers and have been online since
1985. I used to be an avid reader of 2600, and frequented the meeting in
chicago during the 90's. [I admit I still have my first redbox]. It was
also during this time frame I became heavily involved in amateur and cb
The radio experience led me down the path of becoming an On-Air
personality, where my first radio program attracted 3 million listeners. :)
I'm not afraid to learn theory and good design before embarking on a new
electronics project or any project for that matter. I do admit to suffering
from hobby overload from time to time, especially since I'm interested in
almost everything. I have learned almost everything I know by reverse
At my present job I am well known for having the ability to reverse
engineer a new technical process, document it and train others.
Lately I've found myself burning out of the network engineering field, so
starting projects such as these help me keep things in perspective [house,
car, food, wife, etc]

I had considered building it as a linear for the very same reason David
pointed out, "hell to troubleshoot."

@_subject: Switching power supplies 
I'm in the process of researching current power supply technologies to
create a robust  bench supply for my father.
My dad is an rc quad copter enthusiast and enlisted me to create him a
supply. His requirements are 13-48v with a max wattage of 1200w.
Can anyone recommend any good reading materials on switching designs?  I'm
also reading thru rsw's thesis as well.
In an ideal world I'd like to make the supply modular and also have built
in freq width/delay speed control.
I'm also looking to build a 6 amp dc supply for my solid state peltier
experiment (currently using an old dell ps, but this isn't very
