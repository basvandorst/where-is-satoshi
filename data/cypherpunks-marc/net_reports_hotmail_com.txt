@_subject: Please hear me out...it's worth your time. 
Let's get one thing out of the way immediately - I am not a business.  I'm just an individual offering you some information which I have found beneficial to me.  This isn't some hocus pocus hair-
brained scheme that's not exactly legal.  Nor is this information NOT of use to you!  What I am offering is something that is right for our time - something that our parents couldn't take advantage of, and something that our children may not be able to either.
Right now in human history, there's a "sweet spot" that the Internet has reached.  The Internet is still in it's relative infancy in that many people do not yet know how to use it for much more than reading the news and sending e-mail.  But it touches so many people's lives that there is untapped potential just WAITING to be used!!!  And it's times like this that allows those of us who KNOW how to use this tool to sell our "expertise" to those who want to know how.
"BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE INTERNET MYSELF" you may say.  Well, don't sweat it.  As you read on, you will find below 5 information packets which can get anyone, INCLUDING YOU, started using the Internet to further any business venture that you, or anyone else, may dream up.  And here's the best part!!!  After you have read this information yourself, you can start putting it to use RIGHT AWAY, helping other people to learn about the Internet and doing business using this new powerful tool.  And yes, you are bound to make money while doing so.
I absolutely CANNOT promise that you will NOT make any money, because it's just not true - this is not charity work!  KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, and the times we are living in have been dubbed the "Information Age".  So read on, and don't make up your mind either way until you've read this entire e-mail through.  I don't like the thought of people making decisions based on partial information.
Have you ever read the stories about inventors who came up with this BRILLIANT idea and made millions patenting and producing this product?  Must be nice, eh?  Well, not too many of us can think up a life-altering gadget or what-cha-ma-callit to make our income, myself included.  But I found that I didn't need my own idea to start with.  Remember those 5 informatin packets I mentioned earlier?  Well, those packets, or "reports", cover such topics as performing legal bulk e-mailing over the Internet (still the best-proven method to reach clients), advertising for free on the Internet, and running an MLM company on the Internet.  People that DO have an idea for a product or business but don't know about the Internet will be ITCHING to get ahold of this information.  AND YOU CAN BE THE ONE TO GIVE IT TO THEM.  But you can't provide people something you don't have already, so here's what you've gotta do:
I don't know myself who exactly set this program up, but it's quite well done.  There are 5 people on the list below, real people.  I should know - one of them is ME!  We each have all 5 reports already, we were once in your shoes: sitting, reading an e-mail similar to the one you're reading now, full of disbelief.  But we took the necessary action to get the ball rolling, and not one of us regret it, I'm sure.  The first step to take is ordering all 5 of these reports yourself.  You will then, in turn, be able to offer this information, or reports, to others, as I am offering them to you now.
So order all 5 reports shown on the list below.  For each report, send:
     - $5 CASH
     - the name and number of the report you are ordering
     - your e-mail address
Send these to the person whose name and address appears on the list below next to the report.  Be sure to order all five reports before adding your own name, and MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON THE ENVELOPE'S TOP LEFT CORNER in case there are any problems with it in the mail.
When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.  You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.  Your total cost that you will EVER have to pay to get started in this program is $25.  $5 for each of the 5 reports.  Shortly after you send your request for the reports you will receive, via e-mail, each  of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.  Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a backup copy of these reports on floppy, CD-R, backup tape, ANYTHING and keep it in a safe place.  With as valuable as you will find these reports to be, you won't want to let them out of your sight!
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!  People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five spots thinking they could get all the money.  However, it does not work this way.  Some have tried to be greedy and have found out that it didn't work.  So do not try to change anything other than what is instructed.
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take list below and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5 position.  This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 position.
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer.  DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this in your backup along with the reports just in case something happens to your computer.  Trust me - IT CAN HAPPEN.
As I mentioned, the 5 reports that you order actually contain useful information, not only for those who buy them from you, but also for you yourself!  They will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.
There are 2 main ways to get this program going for yourself:
METHOD  BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes.  Let's assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%)  The more e-
mail sent out will also increase these figures.
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10 people responded by moving you down to position  putting themselves in position  and sending out 5,000 e-mail each.  That's a total of 50,000 e-mails sent.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails if only 0.2% responded with orders, that's 100 people responding and ordering Report # 2.  Those 100 people move you down to position  and put themselves in position  then mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-
mails sent.  The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report   Those 1000 people move you down to position  and send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 ORDERS for Report   Finally, those 10,000 people move you to position  and send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report   That's 100,000 ORDERS for report   At $5.00 each that's $500,000.00, or a half-million dollars.  See how this adds up Your total income in this example would be:
1..... $50
2..... $500
3..... $5,000
4..... $50,000
5..... $500,000
Grand Total=$555,550.00
Although 0.2% is a relatively small amount of responses, you can still see the kind of earning potential is out there for this program.  Even if only got a 0.1% response, that's still more than most of us make in several YEARS at our secular jobs!!!  Can you even imagine for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even a quarter of the people sent out 100,000 e-
each or more?  With over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting, there's lots to be contacted!
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method  and move on to method  as you progress.  For every $5 you receive, all you have to do is e-mail the buyer the Report that they ordered. That's it!  Always provide same day service on all orders to keep people happy with the program.  Remember, the longer you make them wait for the reports to get THEIR program going, the less enthusiasm they will have by the time you DO get it to them.  And remember - they can not advertise until they receive the report.
THE REPORTS
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks are NOT accepted. Postal money orders purchased from the US Post Office are the only acceptable alternative. Make sure that any cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper.  On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-
MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.
