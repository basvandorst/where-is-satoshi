IANAL but I believe one can wait for a subpoena, and even then it's not =

Actually under the "copyright alert" scheme, the ISPs specifically are =
*not* to give up personal information, they are simply to take the IP =
address being reported as downloading copyrighted material, and =
determine *internally* who the user is, and then send the user the =
copyright alert, *without* sharing with the accuser who the user is. =20
And yes, in order to share user information forward-facing, one not only =
can - but one *should* - insist on a subpoena, as that will protect you =

(assuming your TOS, as it should, says something like "we will not share =
your private information *unless* required to by law"  (and, IAAL :-) ).

The thing that muddies this is that, as I understand it, the notice was =
not for takedown (i.e. there is not an allegation that they are =
*hosting* infringing material) - it is a notice that one of their users =
*downloaded* copyrighted material (IP, do I have that right?)
This is part of the RIAA's "graduated response" program, to which =
several major ISPs, including AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast,  have agreed.
Basically, the accuser contacts the ISP, and the ISP sends a warning (a =
"copyright alert") to their user (without giving up the user to the =
If the same user is accused subsequently, they get another, sterner =
warning.  In total there is a series of six warnings, with "mitigation =
measures" accompanying the fifth and sixth warning.
If I were counseling an ISP  - whether one that was part of the =
agreement, or not - I would say that the first order is to *put your =
policy around copyright alerts in writing* - asap - and make it as =
specific as possible - and then *ALWAYS FOLLOW IT EVERY SINGLE TIME*.   =20=
It almost (I say almost) doesn't matter what the policy is so long as =
it's reasonable, but it matters that it be followed to the letter every =
time, no exceptions.
And, if you are an ISP that isn't part of the agreement with the RIAA, =
it's still not a bad idea to structure your policy to follow the six =
"copyright alert" structure, because there is some precedent there, and =
then you come off looking like you are trying to do the right thing, =
which will make you a less easy target.
These two articles give a pretty good explanation of the deal:

Please also keep in mind, if it's relevant, that *no warrant* is required for data that is stored by a third-party.  Data on a server, TOR or otherwise, would by definition be data that is stored by a third party.  Which means that if there is a person of interest (POI), it would not be terribly hard to get at personal information about the POI that is not on their own private machines.
