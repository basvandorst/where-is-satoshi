I do what you're trying to accomplish all of the time, including
inside of the Lyx Docs.  The following keystrokes are well-worn for
M-p i
[insert first item]
M-Return M-p Right M-p s
[Creates a "Standard" paragraph nested under the item]
[add content to that "sub-paragraph/-item"]
[Starts next nested "Standard" paragraph]
