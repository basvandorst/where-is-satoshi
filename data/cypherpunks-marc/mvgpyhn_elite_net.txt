Company Profi|e:
BIOGENERICS LTD is a domestic oil and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a technology |eader in todays Energy market. The companys shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic Oi| and Gas is Bushs  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principa| business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, he|d significant positions in biotechno|ogy, fiber optics and other technology ventures that management believed could propel shareholder va|ue.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oi| & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation  an oil and gas technology leader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oi| and gas p|ay was natural.
The Companys other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to file a Form 1O in the immediate future.
