That's provided that the panix.com authoritative NS's are seen in the cache.  Not all name servers return the authoritative NS's in an answer.  (BIND has an option 'minimal-responses yes_or_no;' that control this.  The default is no, but I know of one "yes" user.)
The registrant's copy of the NS set is more credible (RFC 2181 speak) than the registry's copy, so if a cache sees both, the cache tosses the registry copy.  But there's no guarantee that the cache will see both.  Usually it does though.
