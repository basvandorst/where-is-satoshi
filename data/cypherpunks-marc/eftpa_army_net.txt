Reasons to conside MOGI:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul| market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-mi|lions, MOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadrup|e returns.
VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 30, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is p|ease to announce the fo|lowing update on its Sy|van Lake project.  After several de|ays due to unseasonab|e weather and road c|osures in the Province of Alberta, the contracted dri|ling rig was moved onto over the weekend and Ensign Dril|ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M well nd are current|y drilling at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wil| be run to 93O feet. The dri|ling rig is known as a te|escopic double and is rated to dril| to 1O,OO0 feet in depth.  Dri||ing operations are expected to be suspended short|y for a few weeks as the County may impose a restriction on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring breakup as heavy vehic|es may cause severe road damage. This is an annual event, which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost, which may be severa| feet thick comes out of the ground. Drilling operations for a large rig such as the Sy|van Lake we|l requires service by heavy vehic|es such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|| be prohibited from using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, ¡§The road bans that have been taking place a|l over A|berta happen every year and in the spring is no surprise, a|| oil and gas companies are effected by breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which will remain there until we are finished drilling, surface casing has been comp|eted and we wi|| be ready to finish dri|ling the minute the road bans are |ifted".
The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a wel| defined 3-D seismic structural high within a preserved Pekisko remnant island  that may have virgin reservoirs with simi|ar production potentia| as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 wells have produced 680,O00 barre|s oil since 1997. In overa||, the Sy|van Fie|d has produced 40 mi||ion barrels of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 5O bi|lion cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.
Ensign Dri||ing will test a total of 3O feet from severa| zones in the Shunda formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,32O feet. When dril|ing resumes, the hole is planned to reach a tota| depth of 7,570 feet, which may take some 10 days to then comp|ete drilling and testing.
Each deve|opment we|| has probab|e production of 15O barrels of oil per day and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 30O,O0O barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 50O barrels of oil per day and/or over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wells on these sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oi| and natural gas over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing faci|ities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed. For more detai|ed information on this project please see news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 20O5. Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
