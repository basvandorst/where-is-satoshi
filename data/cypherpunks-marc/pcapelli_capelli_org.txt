You are assuming that each phone number represents only one person, which in
most cases is incorrect.

Not only is it censorship, but it also puts a kink in those phoning
anonymously with the phones from the kwik-e-mart.
Won't someone please think of the children?

Can't we just match this up with the 60% of the federal budget taken up by
social security and medicare/medicaid by launching all the recipients of

(You left out cancer, AIDS, and supersized happy meals)
    Intolerant hate filled christian mind set?  How does this differentiate
christians from the muslims, jews, native americans (I can't believe you
were so insensitive as to call them Indians) or even atheists?
    Perhaps we should all give in to the fun-loving stalinist's.  They got
rid of God, and it worked out well for them (and for human rights,
economics, etc etc).
