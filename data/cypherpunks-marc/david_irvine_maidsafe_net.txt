If there are claims that can be discredited then they should be. It's
probably more dangerous than NSA hacks to have insecure or not anonymous
projects claiming they are. I started the sub reddit with the intention if
getting the projects to speak and find commonalities, but to weed out false
claims would also help the community.
I have asked another guy in the office to take over as I am swamped just
now, but it's a good point and one that should be made. If there is proof
of invalid claims we will only help the authors by pointing them out,
surely Engineers use ingenuity and logic so will not mind? If they are
fixable and get fixed, then great we have another project folk can use
safely within the projects scope. It can only be good to logically decide
this through looking at code and design. Granted it's not a small task with
some projects, but in any case even asking to be shown where the IV comes
from or something in the code would be good as a check. So prompted
questions with a snippet of the implementation we are looking at. Or a pen
test type setup we would like to see etc. I don't know, but open to
