I sympathize with your problems, but frankly (and I suspect you know
this, despite your justified irritation) some of the problems you had
are well beyond the scope of "PGP compatibility".  It's not a flaw in
PGP compatibility that PGP5.x won't compile cleanly any longer because
of changes to your build platform, nor is it a flaw in PGP
compatibility that some buggy program you were working with ate your
PGP 2.x keyring files.
The OpenPGP spec handles compatibility issues quite well.  The catch,
of course, is that PGP 2.x isn't OpenPGP and PGP 5.x isn't OpenPGP.
PGP 6 and 7 aren't really OpenPGP either, but they're generally close
enough for all practical purposes.
PGP 7 or GnuPG with the IDEA plugin can handle messages from any
version of PGP, OpenPGP or not.

Yep.  The Venona program in the 40's and 50's is a good example of
this - many of the decrypted messages were actually intercepted years
and years earlier.

Yes.  The update cannot happen overnight.  I see this like MD5 a few
years back.  It is time to start the migration now because it will
certainly take several years to complete.
As you point out, the first step in the migration is knowing what to
migrate to, and that is not at all clear yet.  Until we know what
we're doing, I think we can do more harm by running around crazy and
changing things without careful study.

Yes it is.  Assuming this is true, we must start migrating away from
SHA-1.  Actually, we should start this anyway - even the NIST
recommends moving away from SHA-1 for long-term security.

If you presuppose a workable attack you can conjecture any result you
like.  Let's not go off the deep end here.
Skipping completely over the point that the paper has not been
published yet so it can be checked over by the cryptographic
community, let's assume that they have indeed done what they claim to
have done: demonstrated they can find a collision in 2^69 instead of
2^80 operations.  A collision attack.  Not a preimage attack.  And
it's not workable in practice.  How many entities have the ability to
do 2^69 operations in a sane amount of time?
Without more information, it looks to me like we are now in the
position we were in with MD5 several years ago.  It's not broken in
practical terms yet.  Attacks don't get worse over time, of course, so
we need to start moving to something better.  SHA-1 was already being
phased out:
To be sure, this is bad, but the sky isn't falling yet.

The paper has not been published yet, but the information released
thus far indicates the team was able to find a collision in SHA-1 in
2^69 operations.  Since SHA-1 should have been resistant to collision
to 2^80 operations, this is a very impressive attack.  Incidentally,
this is same team that was behind the successful attack on MD5.
However, in the real world this doesn't seem like a very useful
attack.  It's rather like someone pointing out that the 100 foot high
wall around your house is only 50 feet high.  True, the wall is not as
tell as claimed, but it's still probably taller than it needs to be.
To put this in perspective, the "broken" SHA-1 is stronger than MD5
was thought to be before the MD5 breaks were discovered (MD5 was
Still, I'm speculating based on the little information that has been
released.  Nobody really knows all the details yet since the paper
hasn't been published.  It is not yet known if the attack can be
extended to the SHA-2 hashes (SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512).  Even if
it can be extended, the sheer length of the SHA-2 hashes may render
the attack moot in practical terms... or it might not.  We just don't
know yet.
In terms of GnuPG: it's up to you whether you want to switch hashes or
not.  GnuPG supports all of the SHA-2 hashes, so they are at least
available.  Be careful you don't run up against compatibility
problems: PGP doesn't support 384 or 512, and only recently started
supporting 256.  GnuPG before 1.2.2 (2003-05-01), doesn't have any of
the new hashes.  Finally, if you have a DSA signing key (most people
do) you are required to use either SHA-1 or RIPEMD/160.  RSA signing
keys can use any hash.

Not exactly.  There are two main costs when signing a file: the cost
to hash the file, which is dependent on the size of the file and the
chosen hash algorithm.  The other cost is the signing algorithm.
Since the data signed in a signature is the hash output, and since
hashes are generally tiny relative to the size of the file, this is
really the cost of the signing algorithm itself (the biggest hash
algorithm supported by GnuPG is SHA-512, and that's only 64 bytes

GnuPG supports RSA keys much larger than 4096 bits.   It does not,
however, currently allow generation of such keys, so the keys must
come from elsewhere.
For many cases, yes.  However, ECC is not yet defined for OpenPGP.
Until that happens, there won't be official support for it in GnuPG.
Note, though, there is a ECC version of GnuPG out there if you want to
try it.

To be strictly accurate, the problem is with GPGMail, the plugin that  integrates GPG with Apple's Mail application (as Mail internals  changed significantly between Leopard and Snow Leopard).  GPG itself  seems to work just fine under Snow Leopard, albeit on the command line.
