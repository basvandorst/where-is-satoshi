@_subject: Kaspersky wants to make Tor illegal and supports a globalized policed 
I just read two articles that moved me to bring this to the attention
of others.  Kaspersky Labs thinks anonymity is the problem with the
In Kaspersky's world, services such as Psiphon and The Onion Router
(Tor) - which are legitimately used by Chinese dissidents and Google
users alike to shield personally identifiable information - would no
longer be legal. Or at least they'd have to be redesigned from the
ground up to give police the ability to surveil them. That's not the
kind of world many law-abiding citizens would feel comfortable
He's talking about supporting a police state, where the "law" can
watch everything you do.
[Q:] Are you saying that people often don't understand the
complexities of the work security researchers are involved in?
Consumers, businesses and even governments?
[A:] Governments do understand because they are more and more in touch
with these problems. Enterprises, big enterprises, some of them have
dedicated teams of security experts and they really understand what's
going on. Consumers generally have no clue, but they don't need to

My mom didn't know shit about what to do and not to do on the Internet
and downloaded everything that was free, and that's why I would have
to "fix" his computer every few months even though she uses AVG and
SpyBot.  Finally I sat her down, explained to her why this was
happening, and told her not to do that anymore if she wanted her
computer to work right.  She listened, and hasn't had any serious
problems for a few years now.
From the same article...
[Q:] If you had the power to change up to three things in the world
today that are related to IT security, what would they be?
[A:] Internet design--that's enough.
[Q:] That's it? What's wrong with the design of the Internet?
[A:] There's anonymity. Everyone should and must have an
identification, or Internet passport. The Internet was designed not
for public use, but for American scientists and the U.S. military.
That was just a limited group of people--hundreds, or maybe thousands.
Then it was introduced to the public and it was wrongto introduce it
in the same way.
I'd like to change the design of the Internet by introducing
regulation--Internet passports, Internet police and international
agreement--about following Internet standards. And if some countries
don't agree with or don't pay attention to the agreement, just cut
them off.
This is scary talk from a man who owns the largest anti-virus company
in the eastern hemisphere.  Read these articles, and you'll see this
guy talks about a global "Internet police" or "Internet Interpol".
That's serious globalization talk from someone who millions trust to
protect their computers.  All they need to do is label some code as
malicious, and it'll be removed from your PC after the next A/V
update....even if you use it to regain lost civil liberties.  How long
until Kaspersky labels Tor a trojan or virus?  If that happens, then
People who seek to control society fear society having anonymity, for
it's with anonymity that society can stand up against corruption of
the state when it occurs.  The latest Iran election and the actions
that followed are a great example of this, and it's was technology
such as Tor that helped them get the truth out about what was being
done.  When was the last time a trojan horse or virus helped a country
regain liberty or help bypass censorship?  To treat Tor as such
malware is down right insulting to people's rights everywhere.
Normally I would never think about the following, but as a developer,
I'm weighing the idea of detecting, disabling, and/or deleting
Kaspersky before installing any of the projects I work on.  Such
action should be brought to the users attention, and the action to do
something about it should be evoked by the user.  However, if
Kaspersky does go too far and labels Tor as malware, you can be damn
sure JanusVM, *maybe* Tor VM, and Chromium Browser VM will take
automated action to prevent itself from being attacked by Kaspersky
products, and will do so in a very harsh way.
Something worth noting, today's A/V solutions do not scan inside
virtual machines and would not be able to detect Tor easily.  Use
encryption with the VM and it'll be impossible for any A/V product to
scan the data inside.  If you use an external anonymity device like
januspa or a linux router + Tor, then you would not feel the affects
of bad A/V software against your anonymity.
Personally, I will be encouraging everyone I know to stay as far away
from this company and their products simply out of principle
point.  I had no problem with Kaspersky until I read this.  If
Kaspersky is going to treat non malicious software as malware, then we
might as well treat their software with the same regard.
Spread the word, Kaspersky Labs is not a friend of Tor.

Coderman sent this to me, and I'm a little upset because the extra
$60.00/month for 0 bitcoins is very annoying.  I have since stopped trying
to generate bitcoins, because it's just wasting electricity.  More comment
inline below debating this point.
For those who are wondering if it's worth trying to generate bitcoins, here
is something to think about.
I've had a single Quad-Core (2.6GHz/core, 12MB L2 cache) server crunching on
bitcoins for about 6 months now.  About 2-3 months ago, it stopped
generating bitcoins.
Someone is out there with a lot of GPU's, crunching away at the bitcoin
network and is hording/generating all the bitcoins.  I say this because the
amount of chatter on the bitcoin forums in regards to GPUs vs CPUs has
exploded, and new GPU clients are being released.

Nothing could be further from the truth. =A0Mining/Minting operations
have little/nothing to do with the viability of the network itself.
That's correct, it has to do with the =
number of operations per second you CPU/GPU can do. =A0The network is based=
 on the number of supporters. =A0Apple's and=A0oranges.=A0=
It's a novel way of dealing with inflat=

bitcoins much, much faster than a CPU.=A0
Opportunists will quickly drive the profit from generating down to
almost exactly that of the power costs, but that's to be expected.
No, the value of bitcoins starts to be cut=

the next 210,000 blocks, then 12.5 bc, 6.25 bc and so on." --=A0
So when the value of BTC's starts to be cut in half=
, and with INFLATION now at a record high, the cost of electricity is NOT G=
OING DOWN.Hence, the chance of you generating bitcoins will go d=

lectricity is being used to generate (or not generate) bitcoins, and after =
the last six month's of running bitcoin, I haven't generated a sing=
le block in over two months because someone has already cornered this marke=
t with GPU's.
They are also the driving fo=
rce behind a free market. =A0Or do you think
they are killing those, too? :)
Of course someone quotes the "fre=

One last point; by looking @ the  channel on IR=

Now I ask the community, If your chance of generating a=

 get me wrong, I hate what is happening to the USD, and love the idea =
