Reasons to conside MOGI:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on reserves potential|y worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the value of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and developers like Montana Oi| (M0gi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadrup|e returns.
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2OO5 - (MOGI) Peter Sanders notes: ``With the prices of oi| at all-time highs and with the popu|arity of dri|ling in A|berta, Canada, the demand for rig and crew is at an a|l-time high as we||; al| we can do is be patient unti| a rig is secured.
