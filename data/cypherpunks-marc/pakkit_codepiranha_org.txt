While I certainly support the right of anyone to resist DNA testing I
have a few problems with how this was written... specifically one
Not injured? Does it matter? You can go to jail for attempted murder and
not hurt anyone but does that make the sentence unjust?
Also, a known racist? Based on what? If this guy is from "out of town",
how does he know if the guy is a known racist? not to mention all the
riot gear the cop must have been wearing.. even so... the laws in this
country do not change simply because someone may be a jerk, a racist, or
just a plain asshole... and thank god... I know I am probably classified
into one or more of those categories by people though I don't feel that
I am any of them...
I would be more than happy to jump up for a cause if someone is unjustly
punished or if the cause is just... but that cause needs to be based on
verifiable fact... I read the article and maybe this guy WAS unjustly
punished... but, in the article, there are quotes from this "racist"
police officer and other supposed "facts" with no evidence...
I would agree that sometimes there are excesses of force when people who
try to offer an alternative to the status quo get together in large
groups, and I am not excusing that behavior one bit... but if you are
going to rally behind someone please offer more concrete evidence and
