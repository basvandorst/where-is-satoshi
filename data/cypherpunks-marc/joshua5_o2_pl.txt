Dear Webmaster,
We run several websites offering accommodation services in Europe and I thought you might be interested in Exchanging Links with us. Exchanging Links can bring both of us mutual benefits i.e. Increased Traffic to our websites.
We provide several travel-related sites. All of them are Page Rank 5 or 6. Our Links pages have Page Rank from 2 to 4.
If you are interested please contact me.
If you got this message in error please forward this mail to your webmaster.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Joshua Williams
