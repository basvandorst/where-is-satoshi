I am getting this erro when I try to test sending mail to a local account on the
Jan 27 09:32:29 mail postfix/local[12714]: 3A793780014:
to=, orig_to=, relay=local,
delay=0, status=bounced (cannot access mailbox /var/spool/postfix/Mailbox for
user postfix. cannot create file exclusively: Permission denied)
It seems like it cannpot find the Mailbox for the user postfix, I looked and
there is no mailbox for that account, but why would that stop me from sending
to the user: support
