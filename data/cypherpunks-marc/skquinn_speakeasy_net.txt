I personally find the privacy implications of EDRs rather unsettling. This story doesn't change that one bit. However, in this particular case, I don't think what the EDR said really matters. The three paragraphs from the story say a lot about what happened here:
The *defense* attorney said his client was going 30 mph over the limit (60 mph in a 30 mph zone)! That is a grossly inappropriate speed in a residential area. Here in Texas, a ticket for 55 mph in a 30 mph zone cannot be dismissed with DSC. Not sure how the law works in Florida but I would be surprised if it was that dissimilar.
Let's assume for the moment the prosecution's accident invesitigator is totally full of bovine excrement, and that all manner of gremlins snuck into the EDR thus causing it to record a grossly inaccurate peak speed, and thus, the only version of the story we can give full credibility to is the defense's version. If I were on that jury, I'd still vote for a conviction. Matos is a scofflaw and deserves exactly what he is

Agreed, if you want or need to get between cities faster than land-based
travel will allow, flying is in fact a requirement. That was, in fact,
my point. (Would anyone actually resort to walking between NYC and
As an aside, I often jokingly used the phrase "the only broadband
connections we would have would be UPS and FedEx" back in the days when
DSL and cable modem connections were not as ubitiquous (yes I know
satellite is also an option but it's $DEITY-awful slow and only usable
for the most basic of needs). However, regulation of the Internet such
that couriers would be the only feasible way to move large amounts of
data around (burned to CD or DVD as the case may be) is not a joking
matter in the least.

If you need to get from, say, Houston to Seattle, in less than a full
day, how is driving an option?
Those were local transit buses, not intercity buses. Huge difference.

I can concur with this, though it wouldn't surprise me if lying on
police reports has increased since then.
He may not have a choice. There are three choices for intracity travel
in the US: air, automobile (I'm lumping intracity buses in with personal
cars here for a reason that will be obvious later), and train. First, let's look at automobile travel, which includes buses. There is
one major intracity bus company left and that's Greyhound. They tend to
be cheap, and thus attract people who can't afford to fly. The only
advantage over driving your own car, is you don't have to worry about
doing the driving yourself ("Go Greyhound and leave the driving to us"
if you remember the old commercials). Generally, automobile travel is
nearly unworkable if you're going farther than, say, a 10-hour drive or
about 500 miles.
As for Amtrak (the last passenger rail line left), well, that may be
just as bad in most cases. I have heard that the government subsidies of
Amtrak are being dropped to lower and lower levels, and as such they are
not making enough money to operate at acceptable standards to most of
us. Read misc.transport.rail sometime and you will see what I mean.
Also, you don't get there that much faster than with automobile travel,
and I think it may actually cost more.
I wouldn't speak so ill of the ACLU. Groups like the ACLU are just about
the last thing standing between what's left of our democracy and an
outright dictatorship.
White people aren't even necessarily the "majority" anymore.
This is downright insensitive. (Mr. Monahan, if you actually get to read
this, Terranson does *not* represent the views of all of us in the
least.) I really have a good mind to archive this and send it back to
you when your wife gets pregnant and something similar happens to you.
And again, he likely didn't continue to fly because he wanted to. See

Isn't it possible to emulate the TCPA chip in software, using one's own
RSA key, and thus signing whatever you damn well please with it instead
of whatever the chip wants to sign? So in reality, as far as remote
attestation goes, it's only as secure as the software driver used to
talk to the TCPA chip, right?

Linus Torvalds didn't write the GNU OS. He wrote the Linux kernel, which
when added to the rest of the existing GNU OS, written by Richard
Stallman among others, allowed a completely free operating system.
Please don't continue to spread the misconception that Linus Torvalds
wrote the entire (GNU) operating system.

Agreed, in part. I don't think it'll fly too well if any hardware
manufacturer builds in TCPA such that only a Microsoft-certified OS will
run on it, for one, it's a bad idea to piss off the geeks (and certainly
there's a higher geek to ordinary user ratio in the free software
world), and also this would be a great way for Microsoft to piss off
even the current (far-right Republican) administration. I would expect
the setting to disable the TCPA chip to be present in new hardware for
as long as TCPA lasts, and indeed, there may be cases where even an
ordinary user would want to disable the TCPA chip.
I personally don't trust Microsoft at all. They had their chance to keep
my trust, and they blew it, big time.

I misunderstanding your question?
Unless you plan to follow protected accounts, you don't need to actually
sign up for a Twitter account to keep up with anyone. Each Twitter
account has an RSS feed for that account, which does not need
authentication with a Twitter account to access.
Interesting note: not that long ago, Twitter actually used your
authentication info against you and obstructed attempts to read single
tweets from accounts that had you blocked, and for a while even the
entire feed of accounts blocking you. They have since given up their
pathetic attempt to imitate Facebook's (dangerously overpowered, IMO)
block function.
