Imagine it's 2020:  as you and your family ride by the one remaining
drive-in theater in America, your car's autopilot goes blind...
So I see exceptions in the law for critical systems.
And I see hackers parking their cars in front of their TVs and tapping into
the car's autopilot.
So we need a law to prevent people from putting TV's in their garages.
And some way for Them to know if I have a TV in my garage.
