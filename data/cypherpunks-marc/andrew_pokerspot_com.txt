First, make sure your filter for mattd is listed before your filter for cypherpunks. Also, because it seemed like mattd's from: header was somewhat variant, i have it matching just "mattd". Then there's a "make status: read", a "transfer to: trash", and a "skip rest". Good luck.

Thanks, Jim!
Speaking for myself, I was wondering where the village voice's website was. Lo and behold, it's the incredibly obvious answer!
