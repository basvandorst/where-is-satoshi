This is the end of "normal hijacking". They spoiled it for everyone.
The first thing a "normal hijacker" has to do now is convince everyone that he
is ... normal. I am not aware of any protocol that would ensure this.
[ Maybe island states should offer their airports as receiving points for
normal hijacking, for a fee that is. And hijacking can happen only on
designated route portions, from which the plane can be diverted to a
pre-defined NHTP (normal hijacking termination point) or it will be destroyed.
Entering and leaving these segments will be announced over the aircraft's PA
("This is the first opportunity to normally hijack the aircraft. Please be
advised that you have exactly 17 minutes to do so. If you have any questions
our staff will be glad to assist you.") NHTPs will be filed with every flight
plan and approved in advance. ]

Targeted bioweapons will offer, for the first time, opportunity to get rid of
"others". The more "others" present a monoculture group (genetically, eating
habbits, behavioural patterns) the easier it will be to target them. In this
regard bioweapons work directly against what was driving force in history so
far - grandfalooning around concepts, feeling safe among the same.
[Think microsoft & windoze - I notice that those using them spend more and more
time fighting plagues than doing some useful work, if they ever did. When was
the last time you saw a macintosh or lynx virus ?]
Some alternate lifestyles will (statistically, by chance) offer some
protection. Not that I know what they may be. Ultimately, when everyone has a
bioprinter*, your only safety will be having as little in common with everyone
else as possible, to raise the cost of creating the custom bug.
And this will bring some profound changes.

No shit ?
PR dept. docs are now the "proof" ?
Last night when Chatterbox spoke with Jack Evans, a regional senior vice
president of programming at the radio station chain Clear Channel
Communications, he acknowledged that his company had distributed to its
programmers a list of songs with questionable lyrics that stations
should avoid in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack. (Click here for his
original statements on the list, and scroll down for the content of the
list itself.)
Today, however, Clear Channel issued a press release denying the
existence of the list, and the Web site of Radio Ink, a radio industry
trade publication, reported, "Clear Channel confirmed to Radio Ink this
morning that the banned list was only an Internet rumor."
So what's the truth here? Clear Channel admits it distributed a list of
songs to program directors. It obviously wasn't encouraging stations to
play songs like "Another One Bites the Dust." If you read the press
release carefully, it appears Clear Channel is weaseling out of sticky
situation: "Clear Channel Radio has not banned any songs from any of its
radio stations." Right. They didn't ban any songs, they simply asked
that stations not play them. Chatterbox wonders if there's another song
they might want to add to this supposedly nonexistent list: a little
something by the Sex Pistols.
Jack Evans, a regional senior VP of programming at Clear Channel
insisted this list was not an effort initiated by management: "After and
during what was happening in New York and Washington and outside of
Pittsburgh, some of our program directors began e-mailing each other
about songs and questionable song titles," though the finished list was
distributed to the program directors by Clear Channel management.
Evans concedes that some of the songs are off base: "I think there were
certainly songs on the list that people were reading too much into" (the
Beastie Boys' "Sabotage," perchance?) though he supports the list in
general. "There were a substantial amount of songs in question that I'm
glad the [program directors] brought up so we didn't air them at a very,
very sad time." You can judge for yourself. Here's the list, with
original spellings intact.

Trying to shove the privacy down the throat of unsuspecting citizenry is an

- Sell out and do commercial crypto which will never have any impact on
individual's privacy.
- Sell out and radiate negative vibes and pipe dreams about killing.
The point is, we have not found a killer app that:
a) can be sustained by a small group of disorganised individuals
b) has huge appeal to "ordinary" people.
Remailers satisfy a) but not b), for example.

This may sound obvious, but sometimes it's important to review the basics.
There are two major issues in network connectivity: accessing and addressing.
Both have to be taken care of if one is looking to build an infestation-free
First, access, as in path between two nodes. As long as this is under
centralised control (read chokable) little can be done. Current schemes seem to
rely on last decade's capabilities of ISPs, NSPs and people that control the
Using odd ports, stego (going via 80) will not help asymmetric bandwidth. Bear
in mind that bona fide consumers do not need more than 10 kbit/sec upload
speeds (CC number and product ID). It will also not foil the new generation of routers that will do full
content-based switching on the fly. Clandestine content would have to be REGEX
and MUST (mauhrer's universal stat test, very fast in HW) indistinguishable
from legitimate traffic.
The only way around this is disintermediation of routing - no ISPs, no NSPs.
Self-discovering wireless (hello, Jonathan) is the first step in that
direction. I don't know what will be the next one, but fucking with "Internet"
is a waste of time.
Addressing - as in translation from a piece of known information to the working
pointer to the rest.
What I use today come from three sources that I can do something about and the
fourth that I cannot do anything about.
1. My bookmarks - text strings to host names or IP numbers. About 90% of
lookups go through these.
2. Search engines - again, text strings to URLs, but not under my control. I
could run my own spider engine and build my own database, were I not too lazy
(and Google so good.)
3. DNS - name to IP. I could easily do away with this one by running my own
host tables with occasional nuisance of having to update them, but considering
the number of sites I visit and the rate of IP change (yes, I do keep host
tables for visited hosts just in case) this is not a big deal.
4. Routing tables - since demise of forward routing, I have no control of
whatever ISP/NSP chooses to do. Like sending all suspect requests via certain
host in Maryland. This is basically an access issue.
The issue here is not how to just REPLACE the current hierarchical addressing
schemes. The issue is how to construct a new addressing mechanism which will
prevent some future internic or ICANN from ever coming into existence. A
choke-point free addressing (CPFA).
The first requirement is counter-intuitive: the addressing must not be fully
automatic. The user will HAVE to burn a number of brain cycles for each
addressing operation. This is because any automated process can be subverted
and eventually will lead to ICANN.
Compare this with going to restaurant and ordering "meat" or "vegetables"
without ever being presented with the menu.
The second requirement is that authority must be completely distributed, in
effect non-existent in the traditional sense. I think that the only workable
solution is the one that maps on informal social structures - friends and
relatives providing address pointers and routes to each other (no, this does
not work for shopping at amazon - that is the whole point.)
Or using principles of some other existing informal schemes - like hobos and
homeless do in urban areas. If you walk close to bridges and places that they
use for shelters, you will often see elaborate markings with chalk and
sometimes even paint. Someone wrote a paper on this, there is a whole
signalling language used to inform about many important issues - like places
good to overnight at and places never to be found at. If a relatively
unsophisticated population of travelling vagabonds can develop universally
understood signalling that does not rely on anyone else to work, I am sure that
engineers can do it as well.

That doesn't work in meatspace. Take a look at much (mathematically) simpler

Yet many people are already wary of computers, and we are not talking luddites
here. Using a piece of hardware with invisible transistors and uncomprehensible
firmware to store money doesn't seem likely at all.
Real cash has advantage that it does not need mediation of experts and
expert-built machinery for practical verification and use. It is itself in
human-readable form. While it is true that said experts try to insert their
products in everyday life to secure the regular income, prostituting their
professions, it is unlikely that it will be success when cash is the object.
More people that I know store gold today than ten years ago. General
disenchantment with computing machinery is obvious to all except those blinded
by their vested interests. If you want to find the real state of
computer-consumer economy njust look at the parking lot in front of Fry's. No,
it's not a helidrome, it used to be for cars.
To succeed in this situation the idea, or product, that modifies some very old
concepts has to be really good and sane. The e-checks, as discussed here, fail
to impress even "experts", and don't count that sheeple will be *that* dumb.
I don't understand which problem are you trying to solve.
Apart for few cypherpunks, People With Real Money and mafia, all of whom
already have all the anonymity they want, sheeple is handled by corporations
whose income depends on non-anonymity. I don't see a market pressure for anon
replacement for credit cards from the consumer side any more that I see
pressure for IPSec'd traffic from Joe FivePack.
The difference here is that large and capable entities - banks - stand to lose
if something goes wrong, and they handle the whole system. Privacy and
anonymity, on the other hand, is personal and no one is on your side. You have
to have all resources. Assuming that the bank will expend resources to protect
YOUR anonymity when you don't have any practical means of verifying it is

Faith slathering strategy seems logical. Seeing how PKI is dear to organised

So what would be a practical (and survivable) test ?
Maybe an introduction of a provably strong encryption to observe a difference
in treatment between that and the "practically secure" ones.
For instance, an easy to use package based on OTP. Use A/Ds present on all
today's PCs to sample audio/video noise, distill it, burn two CDs and send one
to the corrspondent. All neatly packaged with GUIs and instructions for dummies
(that include microwaving used CDs).
A minor investment of, say, $200-300K in advertising and giving the software
away for free (toaster OEMs would love it) could get the user base above the
threshold. Observe what happens then.
If PK/block ciphers are really good nothing would happen.
On the other hand, increased parking lot casualties could mean something else.
Well, it's a test.

This is probably the sanest method of estimating capabilities - by observing
the behaviour.
For example, look at the apparent collapse of crypto export controls; there
were never any real working ones in the first place, yet resources were spent
to maintain the illusion. Why ?
There could be transforms which make key extraction trivial; I certainly don't
know of any. For any cypher, there could be a specific (per cipher) plaintext
that leaks the key in some convoluted way when enciphered. Majority of Rijndael
implementations run in 128-bit key mode with 128-bit block size ... is this
really advance over non-AES 128-bit ciphers with 64-bit block size ?
Of course, this does not prove anything, but still, if there were reliable
20-year escrows, I'd bet some money on transparency of modern ciphers.

Still, insistance on the *current public knowledge* about algo security as a

I do not have a rational explanation for this. Crypto history demonstrates
consistent short-sightedness of public and not so public experts. Granted,
within the contemporary knowledge realm they were right.
But when unpredictable advances predictably continue to happen, even the more
dim ones should realise that the current knowledge is not a good metric; it's
like trying to predict a book from an unborn writer.
It took Germans 20 years to find out that allies were decrypting Enigma
traffic. Why would anyone think that the gap between public and private crypto
expertise is anything less today is beyond me.
So do not easily dismiss possibility that someone may not care about
implementation vulnerabilities at all, as long as cyphertext is available.

Collision means same plaintext to the same ciphertext. The collision happens on

billion 128-bit blocks, and if all were the same plaintext there would be about
80 thousand same ones of each of possible 65536 128-bit values.
This has nothing to do with practical security.

Wouldn't it be much simpler (having in mind the low cost of storage), to simply
append several random bits to the plaintext before ECB encrypton and discard
them upon decryption ?
For, say, 128-bit block cipher and 16-bit padding (112-bit plaintext and 16-bit
random fill) the storage requirement is increased 14% but each block is
completely independent, no IV is used at all, and as far as I can see all
pitfails of ECB are done away with.
Probability of the same plaintext encrypting to the same cyphertext is 1 in
65536. For typical unix disk use this *could* provide some hint that large
space is being zeroed, for instance, but when realistic entropy plaintext is
being written the danger is negligible.

Crypto is there for all those who want to encrypt, accessible as it was five

As for argument that OS upgrade game requires live crypto coders to keep up -
that's also bogus. PGP 2.6.3i runs fine on the latest winshit. PGP 2.6.2 runs
fine on latest macs. PGP 2.6.2 compiles under linux and freebsd today (unlike

And they are being used by those who need them. What, no shiny UI ? Tough shit.
Use plaintext. And shiny UI *did not* make masses use 7.0.3, did it ?
Actually, people have machines with 5-6-7 year old OSes ... because they work.
Especially in end-user interface applications - text editors, mail clients,
telnet/ssh/http, there is no need to upgrade at all.
Virus claim is also bogus.
That is, unless you you use microsoft stuff with 5 months average life span.
You do ? I thought so.
Face it, convenient crypto is an exercise in futility. Convenience is
positioning end users where they are wanted - bent over, pants down, cleansed
by the upgrade enema, ready to receive.
ITAR classification was correct, after all. Crypto is arms. Successful crypto

Actually, for the last one or two years it's already illegal to sell or re-sell
(even used) VCRs without macrovision shit.
What will determine the outcome of this war is future availability of universal
openly-programmable computing platforms (aka pee-cees). We will probably see
regulations following those for handguns: for the first few decades everyone
sported them, then they became heavily regulated.
So expect a 5-year federal care for possession of an "unlocked" PC within one

The boosted high-end was mentioned in the context of dolby-recorded tapes
played without dolby circuit on or not present at all.
[and to another troller - music industry became well aware in 90-ties that
their major consumers - teens - do playback dolby tapes without dolby, and got
used to it, which made producers often boost high end in general, even when
dolby became immaterial. It's funny that average spectral characteristics of

Physical number of lines is far from being the only measure of quality.
Compression has a huge impact, and so do other digital artifacts.
For instance, just take a look at the opening scenes (earth rising on the moon
horizon) in Kubrick's 2001 on laserdisc and DVD. In DVD, the dark blue-black
background consists of funny rectangles.
There are also a lot of motion artefacts which give a certain "feel" do DVD
image - but then, that may become fashionable, as valve amplifiers are again
now or listening to dolby-recorded tapes without dolby players - some just like
that boost in the high end.

DVDs are probably the first product ever rolled out exclusively for content
control purposes.
Quality-wise, it's somewhat better than VHS and almost the same as Hi-8 (which
I use for archiving purposes), and definitely inferior to analog laserdisc,
which had a thriving market but is now almost extinct (a nice side-effect being
that titles are now available for $5-10 and there are some which will never
make it to DVD).
Hype and brandheads that salivate on words like "dolby" "surroundumb sound"
aside, average consumer got only new expense with DVDs - buying a player.
Like CDs, audio cassetes and IP protocol, VHS will stay forever with us.

This bullshit is getting deeper and thicker.
(dis)ability to replay received information at will has next to nothing to do
with ability to stop unwanted parties from obtaining secret information.
Let me rephrase this for stupids:
DRM is about enforcing NDA between me and someone who made information
available to me. DRM is about preventing me to transmit information which
became a part of my experience.
DRM is about who owns my memories.
One *is* the sum of information obtained from the outside world. Information
becomes (a small) part of you. This is why people share songs - they identify
with something there and want to communicate it. THAT'S WHY THEY LIKE IT IN THE
FIRST PLACE. The ultimate DRM is city government stopping you from describing streets,
leased apartment owner stopping you from reminiscing sex you had there, school
suing you from passing on the knowledge learned. Put a newborn in a sensory
deprivation tank and twenty years later observe someone who fully obeys
There is no moderate answer to this. The only possible answer is FUCK YOU.
Privacy is about stopping unwanted from knowing my private bits, bits I share
with my chosen circle of associates and friends.
And guess what - I am not a friend or associate with entertainment publishers.
I am not a member.
Sale of information is always a sale to the group one belongs to. After few
iterations it quickly expands to the whole connected world. So publishers can
choose to (a) become pipes more convenient and faster than information working
its way through degrees of separations or (b) go out of business. In the
meantime a lot of money and maybe some blood will be spent trying to accomodate
sheer greed.
There is no middle road. Keep your fingers off my memories or I'll pulverize

The principal philosophical issue here is that the ownership of the "computer"
So far most people owned their computers in the sense that they could make
transistors inside do anything they liked, provided they had some
easily-obtainable knowledge. Content/software vendors had their stuff executed
on enemy's territory with all imaginable consequences.
TCPA-ed computer is actually a single-seat movie theatre teleported to your
house. It's operated and owned by one or more corporations - what you pay when
"buying" the computer are up-front installation costs of the franchise.
Remember that theatres are enclosed spaces with entertainment with doors that
you need a ticket to go through.
Sheeple will get more entertainment. The only problem seems to be that small
independent producers will not get their stuff played there. Tough shit. If
small producers want to fuck with all world's theatres, they need to get
better. Parasiting is over. There is no natural right to program other's
machines. When I go to the theatre I don't want unwashed activists flashing
their stuff on the screen. At least not dumb ones.
Ah, the computers. Well, those that want computers will have them. They may not
be as cheap as today and there will not be as many of them, but I think that
all people *I* deal with will have them, so I don't really care.

a. Mechanical games are those, that depend on one's muscle force.
b. Electrical games are those, that depend on electrical mechanisms.
c. Electromechanical games are those that depend on electrical mechanisms and
the use of one's muscle force.
d. Electronic games are those, that depend on both electrical-electronic
mechanisms and software.
e. Entertainment technical games are those, whose result depends exclusively on
the ability and skill of the player, and are used solely for entertainment.
The category (e) also includes all card games which had been characterised as
"technical" games, according to the statement of law F.E.K A21. ------------ The prohibition of using computers described in Article 2 does not affect
internet cafes, as long as the computers are not used for any gaming
To be able to run an Internet cafe, a special permit is required from the
municipal or the state where the company is based) and from its starting point
(port) if it is a boat based company. According to the first application of
this measure, the company should be equipped with this permit in three months
from the issue date of this law.

The main difference, the axis along which one classifies
maillists/usenet/weblogs is the control.
On usenet, once the site agrees to carry a newsgroup, you have many entry
points and automatic distribution that is next to impossible to choke (other
than with noise.)
Maillists are more controllable (as even cypherpunk nodes experienced) but and
probably the least bad solution so far. And they are not much different from
usenet - fewer "newsgroups" (you decide what you want) and you are your own
server. With today's connectivity and computing resources, smaller maillists
(seeral hundred subscribers) don't really need servers (exploders) - just a
shared recipient list. Very censorship-resistant.
Weblogs are at the mercy of site operators and extremely vulnerable to

The importance of geographic routing is that the cataloguing system is public.
Imagine that city streets had absolutely no signs and no house numbers. In
order to get to, say, "quality whorehouse", you need to pay for someone to
guide you, and ultimately that someone may choose not to. If, however, streets
were marked, you could use maps from many sources - or even create your own -
to guide you.
Localities put up the addressing infrastructure and they get aggregated on
global levels in any desireable/sellable form.
Compare this to Internet, where you essentially have to pay to get routed via
closed systems. >These characters< were routed based on decisions and policies
of no more than 2-3 corporations. We all know what the consequences are.
Self-routing mesh networks have potential to sidestep this. Transistors are
small and cheap enough even today - the centralised communication
infrastructure is there so that you can be charged, not because technology
dictates that any more. With wireless there is a potential that everyone paves
(and marks street number) in front of their house. The only way to subvert this
would be to erase "santa monica" from minds of everyone. I don't see that
happening. The day that I can send a packet from LAX to SFO via non-ISP-ed network will be
the beginning of the end of telco/telecom monopolies. Or, should I say,

(we know who you are, behave or else ...) - and then the biometrics ceases to
be in the interest of the eyeball holder. Even granting door access to
"employees" fits this category. You don't let "any qualified mathematician

There is enough wideband power in the ether above inhabited areas to make
passive detection from reflected EM possible in theory (without any EM
emanating from the target.) The space is illuminated, but the "eyes" are not
good enough, yet. Signal levels are extremely low, but it's likely that a
flying jet reflects back enough from hundreds of cellphone/celltower
transmissions to be few dB above the background noise. However, without knowing
where to "look" the receiver cannot use typical narrow beam high-gain antennas.
What is needed is an array, like an insect's eye, and that will be a sizeable
contraption - passive, but not small. In other words, the size of a passive eye
is proportional to the wavelength. To get human eye resolution in 10cm band the
size gets to 2km across. Big eye.

At this point it is immaterial what Verisign will or will not do. They followed
the predictable course based on their capabilities and the assessment that the
response from some imaginary "community" is irrelevant.
The actual damage is breaking network diagnostic procedures and spam filtering,
increasing chance of undetected lost e-mail (their SMTP does not always bounce)
and increased danger of mistyped domain names - as now such typo in http client
leads to exposure to possibly adversarial html (which is why they started it
all in the first place.)
By this time it should be obvious to everyone that in the near future they will
establish targeted advertizing depending on what the mistyped URL looks like -
and probably sell or rent the "typo name space" - ie. Airborne Express could
buy *f?*e?*d?*e?*x?*.com address space, so fredex.com would lead to airborne's
web site.
And then there is a very small step from there to schemes where, for instance,
for basic $15-25/yr name rental your domain will be yours only in 90% of cases.
Other 10% will be sold. For $100/yr you will be guaranteed 99.5% of the
ownership. Of course, only platinum premium accounts, at $100K/yr, will have
100% ownership.
That is the problem when a centralized technical solution relies on the legal
system (and they almost always do.)
What is important is how and if will this accelerate alternate solutions for
name space management.

Looks like the only way to shield from DOS is to raise the cost of DOS. This
will eventually eliminate the low cost of Internet bandwidth, one way or
another. You don't get nearly the same amount of DOS on your telephone as you
do on Internet, right ? Because telephone call is not free and/or it's
The only question is how and where will this cost be introduced. My guess is
that it will happen on the sending side. Even today, assymmetric
cheapo-consumer connectivity makes publishing hard (as in "you are not visible
to the world".) But to handle DOS is harder, as major drive & money on internet
is selling shit, and players want easy (say 800-number) access. Proposals a la
net-driving-license (NDL) indicate the trend.
NDL can happen. Compare it to the early situation with cars or guns. No
regulation in the beginning, you could buy or make your own and do as you
please. Then, when commerce began to depend on both (transport of goods and
force monopolies) they got regulated. I see no difference between that and
computer with an Internet link. NDL is a possible reality. It used to be normal
to drive or carry a weapon without license. These days, they catch you sooner
or later and beat you into pulp. Same thing. Dreaming about it not happening
will get you nowhere.
So what can be done to raise the cost of DOS without introducing NDL ? I have
no answer to this.
What kind of NDL is the least bad ?
- requirement for something that requires human effort when opening a
connection. You do want to let humans into the store, but will refuse entry to
headless drones. OK, wrong analogy. But you get the idea.
- simply raise the cost of outgoing bandwidth - add a cost to every SYN request
or equivalent (have a decent number included in the basic bandwith fee.) This
will make unsuspecting collaborators in DDoS more efficient in keeping their
equipment clean  ("whoever aids .... will be considered enemy combatant.)
The future doesn't seem bright. I think that there is a short window - a year
or two - in which some not-so-bad solution may preempt what They are trying to
do. But I wouldn't hold my breath. It's far more likely that EFF and other
wirehuggers will continue to be outraged (with zero effect as usual) and
clampdown on 'net access will continue.

But unlike stego, where the issue is faking the noise, personal fingerprints
can be removed from the message more reliably. You just need the right gloves.
One way is to use automated translators. They all have an "internal language"
and modules that translate to and from it. The internal language is far more
restricted than the natural one, so it doesn't leak many aspects of the
linguistic fingerprint. Going to the internal form is "lossy" compression.
There is no way to recreate the original.
The simplest method is an englih-to-english translator. Better method, and
thicker gloves, can be used by going through several from/to modules for
different languages. In commercial engines the meaning starts to suffer after
3-4 steps but just before that happens the word ordering and use gets
completely skewed.
Of course, you have to buy the translator and not use the online
google/babelfish access. It's the small things that get you ...

Apologies for introducing crypto-related stuff: RNG that reads minds and predicts future:
Can This Black Box See Into the Future?
DEEP in the basement of a dusty university library in Edinburgh lies a
small black box, roughly the size of two cigarette packets side by side,
that churns out random numbers in an endless stream.
At first glance it is an unremarkable piece of equipment. Encased in
metal, it contains at its heart a microchip no more complex than the
ones found in modern pocket calculators.
But, according to a growing band of top scientists, this box has quite
extraordinary powers. It is, they claim, the 'eye' of a machine that
appears capable of peering into the future and predicting major world
The machine apparently sensed the September 11 attacks on the World
Trade Centre four hours before they happened - but in the fevered mood
of conspiracy theories of the time, the claims were swiftly knocked back
by sceptics. But last December, it also appeared to forewarn of the
Asian tsunami just before the deep sea earthquake that precipitated the
epic tragedy.
Now, even the doubters are acknowledging that here is a small box with
apparently inexplicable powers.
'It's Earth-shattering stuff,' says Dr Roger Nelson, emeritus researcher
at Princeton University in the United States, who is heading the
research project behind the 'black box' phenomenon.
'We're very early on in the process of trying to figure out what's going
on here. At the moment we're stabbing in the dark.' Dr Nelson's
investigations, called the Global Consciousness Project, were originally
hosted by Princeton University and are centred on one of the most
extraordinary experiments of all time. Its aim is to detect whether all
of humanity shares a single subconscious mind that we can all tap into
without realising.
And machines like the Edinburgh black box have thrown up a tantalising
possibility: that scientists may have unwittingly discovered a way of
predicting the future.
Although many would consider the project's aims to be little more than
fools' gold, it has still attracted a roster of 75 respected scientists
from 41 different nations. Researchers from Princeton - where Einstein
spent much of his career - work alongside scientists from universities
in Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany. The project is
also the most rigorous and longest-running investigation ever into the
potential powers of the paranormal.
'Very often paranormal phenomena evaporate if you study them for long
enough,' says physicist Dick Bierman of the University of Amsterdam.
'But this is not happening with the Global Consciousness Project. The
effect is real. The only dispute is about what it means.' The project
has its roots in the extraordinary work of Professor Robert Jahn of
Princeton University during the late 1970s. He was one of the first
modern scientists to take paranormal phenomena seriously. Intrigued by
such things as telepathy, telekinesis - the supposed psychic power to
move objects without the use of physical force - and extrasensory
perception, he was determined to study the phenomena using the most
up-to-date technology available.
One of these new technologies was a humble-looking black box known was a
Random Event Generator (REG). This used computer technology to generate
two numbers - a one and a zero - in a totally random sequence, rather
like an electronic coin-flipper.
The pattern of ones and noughts - 'heads' and 'tails' as it were - could
then be printed out as a graph. The laws of chance dictate that the
generators should churn out equal numbers of ones and zeros - which
would be represented by a nearly flat line on the graph. Any deviation
from this equal number shows up as a gently rising curve.
During the late 1970s, Prof Jahn decided to investigate whether the
power of human thought alone could interfere in some way with the
machine's usual readings. He hauled strangers off the street and asked
them to concentrate their minds on his number generator. In effect, he
was asking them to try to make it flip more heads than tails.
It was a preposterous idea at the time. The results, however, were
stunning and have never been satisfactorily explained.
Again and again, entirely ordinary people proved that their minds could
influence the machine and produce significant fluctuations on the graph,
'forcing it' to produce unequal numbers of 'heads' or 'tails'.
According to all of the known laws of science, this should not have
happened - but it did. And it kept on happening.
Dr Nelson, also working at Princeton University, then extended Prof
Jahn's work by taking random number machines to group meditations, which
were very popular in America at the time. Again, the results were
eyepopping. The groups were collectively able to cause dramatic shifts
in the patterns of numbers.
From then on, Dr Nelson was hooked.
Using the internet, he connected up 40 random event generators from all
over the world to his laboratory computer in Princeton. These ran
constantly, day in day out, generating millions of different pieces of
data. Most of the time, the resulting graph on his computer looked more
or less like a flat line.
But then on September 6, 1997, something quite extraordinary happened:
the graph shot upwards, recording a sudden and massive shift in the
number sequence as his machines around the world started reporting huge
deviations from the norm. The day was of historic importance for another
reason, too.
For it was the same day that an estimated one billion people around the
world watched the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales at Westminster
Dr Nelson was convinced that the two events must be related in some way.
Could he have detected a totally new phenomena? Could the concentrated
emotional outpouring of millions of people be able to influence the
output of his REGs. If so, how?
Dr Nelson was at a loss to explain it.
So, in 1998, he gathered together scientists from all over the world to
analyse his findings. They, too, were stumped and resolved to extend and
deepen the work of Prof Jahn and Dr Nelson. The Global Consciousness
Project was born.
Since then, the project has expanded massively. A total of 65 Eggs (as
the generators have been named) in 41 countries have now been recruited
to act as the 'eyes' of the project.
And the results have been startling and inexplicable in equal measure.
For during the course of the experiment, the Eggs have 'sensed' a whole
series of major world events as they were happening, from the Nato
bombing of Yugoslavia to the Kursk submarine tragedy to America's hung
election of 2000.
The Eggs also regularly detect huge global celebrations, such as New
Year's Eve.
But the project threw up its greatest enigma on September 11, 2001.
As the world stood still and watched the horror of the terrorist attacks
unfold across New York, something strange was happening to the Eggs.
Not only had they registered the attacks as they actually happened, but
the characteristic shift in the pattern of numbers had begun four hours
before the two planes even hit the Twin Towers.
They had, it appeared, detected that an event of historic importance was
about to take place before the terrorists had even boarded their fateful
flights. The implications, not least for the West's security services
who constantly monitor electronic 'chatter', are clearly enormous.
'I knew then that we had a great deal of work ahead of us,' says Dr
What could be happening? Was it a freak occurrence, perhaps?
Apparently not. For in the closing weeks of December last year, the
machines went wild once more.
Twenty-four hours later, an earthquake deep beneath the Indian Ocean
triggered the tsunami which devastated South-East Asia, and claimed the
lives of an estimated quarter of a million people.
So could the Global Consciousness Project really be forecasting the
Cynics will quite rightly point out that there is always some global
event that could be used to 'explain' the times when the Egg machines
behaved erratically. After all, our world is full of wars, disasters and
terrorist outrages, as well as the occasional global celebration. Are
the scientists simply trying too hard to detect patterns in their raw
The team behind the project insist not. They claim that by using
rigorous scientific techniques and powerful mathematics it is possible
to exclude any such random connections.
'We're perfectly willing to discover that we've made mistakes,' says Dr
Nelson. 'But we haven't been able to find any, and neither has anyone
Our data shows clearly that the chances of getting these results by
fluke are one million to one against.
That's hugely significant.' But many remain sceptical.
Professor Chris French, a psychologist and noted sceptic at Goldsmiths
College in London, says: 'The Global Consciousness Project has generated
some very intriguing results that cannot be readily dismissed. I'm
involved in similar work to see if we get the same results. We haven't
managed to do so yet but it's only an early experiment. The jury's still
out.' Strange as it may seem, though, there's nothing in the laws of
physics that precludes the possibility of foreseeing the future.
It is possible - in theory - that time may not just move forwards but
backwards, too. And if time ebbs and flows like the tides in the sea, it
might just be possible to foretell major world events. We would, in
effect, be 'remembering' things that had taken place in our future.
'There's plenty of evidence that time may run backwards,' says Prof
Bierman at the University of Amsterdam.
'And if it's possible for it to happen in physics, then it can happen in
our minds, too.' In other words, Prof Bierman believes that we are all
capable of looking into the future, if only we could tap into the hidden
power of our minds. And there is a tantalising body of evidence to
support this theory.
Dr John Hartwell, working at the University of Utrecht in the
Netherlands, was the first to uncover evidence that people could sense
the future. In the mid-1970s he hooked people up to hospital scanning
machines so that he could study their brainwave patterns.
He began by showing them a sequence of provocative cartoon drawings.
When the pictures were shown, the machines registered the subject's
brainwaves as they reacted strongly to the images before them. This was
to be expected.
Far less easy to explain was the fact that in many cases, these dramatic
patterns began to register a few seconds before each of the pictures
were even flashed up.
It was as though Dr Hartwell's case studies were somehow seeing into the
future, and detecting when the next shocking image would be shown next.
It was extraordinary - and seemingly inexplicable.
But it was to be another 15 years before anyone else took Dr Hartwell's
work further when Dean Radin, a researcher working in America, connected
people up to a machine that measured their skin's resistance to
electricity. This is known to fluctuate in tandem with our moods -
indeed, it's this principle that underlies many lie detectors.
Radin repeated Dr Hartwell's 'image response' experiments while
measuring skin resistance. Again, people began reacting a few seconds
before they were shown the provocative pictures. This was clearly
impossible, or so he thought, so he kept on repeating the experiments.
And he kept getting the same results.
'I didn't believe it either,' says Prof Bierman. 'So I also repeated the
experiment myself and got the same results. I was shocked. After this I
started to think more deeply about the nature of time.' To make matters
even more intriguing, Prof Bierman says that other mainstream labs have
now produced similar results but are yet to go public.
'They don't want to be ridiculed so they won't release their findings,'
he says. 'So I'm trying to persuade all of them to release their results
at the same time. That would at least spread the ridicule a little more
thinly!' If Prof Bierman is right, though, then the experiments are no
laughing matter.
They might help provide a solid scientific grounding for such strange
phenomena as 'deja vu', intuition and a host of other curiosities that
we have all experienced from time to time.
They may also open up a far more interesting possibility - that one day
we might be able to enhance psychic powers using machines that can 'tune
in' to our subconscious mind, machines like the little black box in
Just as we have built mechanical engines to replace muscle power, could

Dr Nelson is optimistic - but not for the short term. 'We may be able to
predict that a major world event is going to happen. But we won't know
exactly what will happen or where it's going to happen,' he says.
'Put it this way - we haven't yet got a machine we could sell to the
But for Dr Nelson, talk of such psychic machines - with the potential to
detect global catastrophes or terrorist outrages - is of far less
importance than the implications of his work in terms of the human race.
For what his experiments appear to demonstrate is that while we may all
operate as individuals, we also appear to share something far, far
greater - a global consciousness. Some might call it the mind of God.
'We're taught to be individualistic monsters,' he says. 'We're driven by
society to separate ourselves from each other. That's not right.
We may be connected together far more intimately than we realise.'

Cable cutting, if that's what it is, impairs two domains: data harvesting (as
there is less to harvest) and cost/quality of the affected communications.
These two domains cannot possibly belong to the same side of the Conflict. I
find affecting data harvesting to be improbable, so it's either:
- done by the affected principalities themselves as a neat way to limit
undesired communications for their own subjects;
- or a spook agency doing a live "what if comms go away" testing in irrelevant
parts of the world;
- or a previously undiscovered natural phenomenon (mutant laser-head sharks.)

The cost of breaking even bad crypto can be quite high.
If you just take, for example, DES, and change all S boxes to different random values, then provide these values as pre-arranged secret key to the other party, and use them only with this single correspondent, and keep your algorithm secret, while using a single 1-character key "a" through "5" depending on the day of month, how long do you think it will take someone to break the cipher and how much would it cost?
First they have to get enough text for correlation and differential attacks. Then they are starting with quite long 2K-bit S boxes that need to be inferred. It would take a brilliant analyst more then few days to break this. Few days of a brilliant analyst at Ft. Mead are very expensive, when you include all the overhead. Say $0.1-0.5M.
Compare this cost to the cost of breaking a massively used crypto algorithm with a backdoor.

While avalanche noise (hoping it doesn't start to tunnel - that current must be actively controlled as each junction is different) is a good source of randomness (up to megabits / sec / junction), "encrypting" it just means masking possible low entropy. I'd prefer to see raw conditoned stream than "encrypted" one (even web content looks high-entropy to Diehard when encrypted).

The distributed model needs to be people-centric, not site-centric, and recreate existing social models (*not* failed "web of trust".)
As a wild example:
Imagine everyone being able to issue blinded Chaumian cash. You give your coins to people you, sort of, trust a bit. Maybe various coins for various purposes.
Then those people submit (now blinded) coins to the web sites they, sort of, trust.
You come to a site, do automated hashed lookup*, and if you recognise some minimum amount of your own coins, you, sort of, start to pay attention to that site.
There is no CA anywhere to be seen, except yourself.
* I know this is expensive, but this can be a one-time event after which you certify the site to your browser(s).

What I find endlessly amusing is that enormous amount of crypt-engineering efforts go into development of resilient P2P networks with "freedom fighters"-class of rationalizations, only to be exclusively used by those who just want free commercial content.
At least, without these networks, those without money would be spared from that drivel.

The issue was that the threat model was not successfully sold to the general public. This was/is a political/sociological obstacle.
Think the smoking issue: it was hard to shed light on the causality where cause and effect are 10-20 years apart, despite the fact that almost all major players (except the tobacco industry) cooperated.
With encryption, none of the major players cooperates, and the distance between the cause and effect is more likely 20-30 years (data harvesters getting ahead of and hamstringing the general public.)

Antartica can function without external cash flow only if it's zero-sum inside, ie. no value created, which is true for any collection of, ehm, scientists.
Growing, however, creates real value that would need to be balanced with external cash inflow (a very useful indicator of how much is being grown, BTW.)

BitCoin has only one problem: maintenance of the relationship between unit BitCoin value and the material world (energy, as in KWh) is 'soft', it requires some sort of a volatile communal effort, which sets it for failure (as a counter example, the amount of Au atoms on this planet is rather independent from any communal effort.)
The relationship between unit value and the material world needs to be fixed. It's just a matter of time.
Then we may name it ButtCoin.

How is this conceptually different from a 2-node Tor network, where each ISP operates one node of the pair linking to every other ISP (so there are I^2 pairs)? Additional benefit of using Tor would be mixing and making traffic analysis harder. Threat modelling could draw on the existing research on Tor vulnerabilities.
Also, an ISP could easily, today, run single-node Tor network to obscure end point locations.
The problem does not seem technical at all. The problem is that ISPs have physical addresses. What you need is a floating ISP ... go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man
