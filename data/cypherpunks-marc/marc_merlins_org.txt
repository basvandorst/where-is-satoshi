So I unfortunately do not disagree with what you're saying, although I can
also see how some people haven't given up and are still trying to have
systems that they can trust end to end as much as possible.
Out of curiosity, what's your stance? Do you just accept that no system you
can get is guaranteed to be secure on the hardware level, and hope someone
high up enough isn't after you?
(that's pretty much where I'm standing for lack of better choices)
But I can see how companies like my employer or now foreign governments who
don't trust anything coming from the US, or going through the US (like gmail
just having been banned for all use by Indian officials), would want to try
a bit harder, even if can seem like a losing battle if your opponent is
sufficiently funded and motivated.

Oh, I didn't notice you were there the first time :)
Please don't embarras me, I'm not sure it's good enough to see twice :)
I wish I could go into the more interesting bits that I can't touch in a
40mn talk, but there just isn't enough time in that timeslot.
However, the LISA paper (already written, but I believe I'm not supposed to
distribute it before LISA makes it available, although if that's not a
problem, I can give a copy) goes into a bit more.
Mmmh, but for all its length I just realized that I didn't even touch the
problem of invariant builds and diffing binary packages.
Worst case, I can give more details over a good meal :)
(but really it's not really anything super fancy, we just unpack both debs,
do a few tricks for .gz timestamps inside the gz stream and .pyc files, and
roll back mtimes of files that don't have changed content so that we don't
even have to sync the new copy's mtime at all)

Not that it's the main point of the talk, but I'm giving a talk about
upgrading all our servers from Red Hat to Debian built from source and
stripped at Linuxcon in New Orleans, Lisa in DC, and LCA in Perth.
A good reason to book a vacation if shaking my hand isn't a good enough one

There is no magic involved, it's just time consuming and virtually no
companies have staff they are willing to spend on it.
Also, that's a server distribution with fewer than 200 packages.
My laptop:
gandalfthegreat:~$ dpkg --list | wc -l
server magic:~$ dpkg --list | wc -l
server gargamel:~# dpkg --list | wc -l        You get the point, it's time consuming, especially if you're checking /
stripping each package first, including fixing parts that make the package
non invariant on rebuilds.
We also had a package diff-er that accounted for zipped man pages, pyc files, and other files that changed each time you rebuilt them.
But really, not rocket science.

I did that at google for our distribution that runs in production,
well more specifically we don't run upstream binaries at all. We've
re-bootstrapped our own distribution, maintain and compile our own openssl,
openssh and so forth.
We also have mostly binary invariant builds, and yes that was work, we had
to patch stuff for sure.
However, that process didn't tell us if the upstream binaries were the same
because we modified most of our source to be leaner and compiled differently
than upstream.
