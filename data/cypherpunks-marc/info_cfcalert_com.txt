Protect the Pledge of Allegiance!
For 226 years America and her flag have stood for Independence, Liberty, Freedom and Justice. Fellow Americans, let us join as one in our stand against terrorism and tyranny. Imagine the uplifting effect of four million patriots proudly declaring, "I Pledge Allegiance to the United States of America." Take one minute of your time and add your name to the Pledge of Allegiance. Help inspire confidence and strengthen our collective resolve. Take the action of a patriot. NOW. God bless America. On June 25th, 2002, the 9th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional and cannot be recited in public schools because it contains the words "under God." This unbelievable and absurd ruling is yet another salvo from activist judges more interested in making their own law rather than following the Constitution. After months of anxious waiting, the Supreme Court has announced it will hear the case against the Pledge of Allegiance. The Christian Family Coalition is calling on ALL who support the phrase "One nation under God" should remain in the Pledge to take immediate action by signing our "Protect the Pledge Petition".
We, as Americans, stand with members of the United States Congress in asking the Supreme Court of the United States to affirm the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the phrase "under God' We support the Pledge of Allegiance, including the phrase, "One nation under God." We believe that the action taken by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in declaring our Pledge UNCONSTITUTIONAL, is a direct violation of our Constitutional freedom.
