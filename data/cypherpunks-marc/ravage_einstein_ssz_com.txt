THE TERROR TEST AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE WESTERN WORLD
We are facing an alliance of leftist forces remnants of Communism and
radical Moslem movements, in which the dictator Fidel Castro places his
The bloody episodes of terror of September 11th, which occurred
simultaneously in New York and Washington, could in some ways be
interpreted as a huge testing of the North American and world public
opinion, at the hands of anti-Christian forces bent on the destruction
of the Western World. As pointed out by the German strategist Karl von
Clausewitz, the main objective in a war is to eliminate the adversary's
will to resist.  Following that line of thought, the attack on September
11th proved, in the midst of tragedy, in an uplifting reality for the
Western world and undoubtedly uncomfortable for its adversaries: rising
above the pain, uncertainty and the irreversible changes in every day
life, the majority of the people of North American reacted in the spirit
of patriotism and with a determination to resist the enemy, with an
intensity difficult to predict after the nature of such attacks.
Meanwhile, in Latin America a phenomenon is taking place which causes
great apprehension: after the initial horror and consequent solidarity
with the victims, the public opinion has suffered a subtle but effective
pressure from leftist forces, through the media, to try to blame what
happened on the United States, presenting the victims as those which
launched the attacks.
In an attempt to obtain this unacceptable roll reversal, the same
mechanism that has been used so many times to absolve the Communist
regime of Cuba by making the exiled Cubans and the United States the
aggressors. This the same type of play with words by the left that were
used during the 1960's and the 1980's to justify the aggressions in the
continent of pro-Castro guerilla forces.
Regrettably,  there are ecclesiastical voices, independent from their in
tentions, that are allowing themselves to be used in that dangerous
game.  For example, the influential Brazilian Archbishop Mons. Luciano
Mendes de Almeida, who served in a prominent position in the Catholic
Conference of Brazil and in CELAM, said referring to the attacks of
September 11th:  "It is because of the extreme amount of poverty and the
domination of some countries over others, that things of this nature
This type of talk is occurring mainly in Latin America put it can also
be heard in Europe and even in the United States, with the collaboration
of those mechanisms that protect the so called anti-globalization
movements.  In the concrete order of the acts which occurred we are in
the presence of an alliance between leftist forces remnants of Communism
and radical Moslem movements, in which the dictator Fidel Castro places
his expectations of survival.
All of this brings us to a fundamental theme, in which we have insisted
upon an uncountable amount of times, when it comes to the defense of the
Western world and the cause of freedom of Cuba: the importance of
publicity. In effect, it seems exaggerated to say after having witnessed
the destructive capacity of terrorism, but in reality the decisive
battle continues to be in the psychological and ideological fields. A
type of battle which is capable of destroying man spiritually, all the
while maintaining his physical health intact.
We decidedly enter into a world where chaos is multiplied by chaos. To
learn to survive in that atmosphere means not accepting it as something
natural but instead each time we need to prepare ourselves to have more
will to resist and more of a vigilant spirit.
Without a doubt, the results of the test of terror where not totally
favorable for the anti-Christian forces.  But it is also true that we
have before us an arduous path, full of traps and things that are
unforeseen. Let us learn necessary lessons for the cause of freedom.
Far from the vicissitude of the present time and future circumstances,
the promise of the Most Holly Virgin in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917, which
is undoubtedly a motive for bright hope:  "At last, my Immaculate Heart
will triumph".

gnu tytso
The real-RNG in the Intel chip generates something like 75 kbits/sec
of processed random bits.  These are merely wasted if nobody reads them
before it generates 75kbits more in the next second.
I suggest that if application programs don't read all of these bits
out of /dev/intel-rng (or whatever it's called), and the kernel
driver should feed some of the excess random bits into the /dev/random
pool periodically.  When and how it siphons off bits from the RNG is a
separate issue; but can we agree that feeding otherwise-wasted bits
into a depleted /dev/random would be a good idea?
A better way to structure this might be for /dev/intel-rng to register
with /dev/random as a source of entropy that /dev/random can call upon
if it depletes its pool.  /dev/random would then be making decisions
about when to stir more entropy into the pool (either in response to a
read on /dev/random, or to "read ahead" to increase the available pool
in between such reads).  Thus, when demand on /dev/random is high, it
would become one of the "application programs" that would compete to
read from /dev/intel-rng.  Since /dev/random is the defined interface
for arbitrary applications to get unpredictable bits out of the
kernel, I would expect that in general, /dev/random is likely to be
the MAJOR consumer of /dev/intel-rng bits.
(Linux IPSEC uses /dev/random or /dev/urandom for keying material.  It
can easily consume many thousands of random bits per second in doing
IKE's Diffie-Hellman to set up dozens of tunnels.  Today this "surge
demand" occurs at boot time when setting up preconfigured tunnels -- a
particularly bad time since the system hasn't been collecting entropy
for very long.  /dev/intel-rng's high-spead stream can significantly
improve the quality of this keying material, by replenishing the entropy
pool almost as fast IPSEC consumes it.  Over time, IPSEC's
long-term demand for random bits will increase, since opportunistic
encryption allows many more tunnels to be created, with much less
effort per tunnel by the system administrator.)
Also, the PRNG in /dev/random and /dev/urandom may someday be broken
by analytical techniques.  The more diverse sources of true or
apparent randomness that we can feed into it, the less likely it is
that a successful theoretical attack on the PRNG will be practically
successful.  If even a single entropy source of sufficiently high
speed is feeding it, even a compromised PRNG may well be unbreakable.

As far as I heard from the news (who knows how
much news meet reality...) the CIA and NSA could
not find a real correlation between the terrorists
and Bin Laden (or at least they couldn't within the
first days after).
German news magazine DER SPIEGEL (current issue, p. 27)
reports, that the german intelligence service BND
(Bundesnachrichtendienst) did find that link.
Usually wiretapping people of Bin Laden's organization is
found as good as useless, because these people keep
strict discipline when using phones. In contrast to that,
some of them dropped discipline after the attacks.
They did jubilate and strut with their attacks. This
was wiretapped by BND and forwarded to the US. The BND asked the US to keep this absolutely secret, because
the BND hoped to catch more of these phone calls and
thus more information, what obviously
wouldn't work if it got publicly known.
US senator Orrin Hatch is said to have publicly revealed
this wiretapping success, thus sealing this source of
Can anyone confirm this story?
What's the use of a crypto-ban and wiretapping, or
an intelligence service in general, if
american authorities behave like this?

Special Report
Osama Bin Laden: How the U.S.
Helped Midwife a Terrorist Ahmed Rashid of Pakistan is a member of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a project of the Center for Public Integrity. He is the Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review and The Daily Telegraph of London. This is an excerpt from his book "Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia" (Yale University Press).
By Ahmed Rashid
In 1986, CIA chief William Casey had stepped up the war against the Soviet Union by taking three significant, but at that time highly secret, measures.
He had persuaded the US Congress to provide the Mujaheddin with American-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down Soviet planes and provide US advisers to train the guerrillas. Until then, no US-made weapons or personnel had been used directly in the war effort.
 The CIA, Britain's MI6 and the ISI [Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence] also agreed on a provocative plan to launch guerrilla attacks into the Soviet Socialist Republics of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the soft Muslim underbelly of the Soviet state from where Soviet troops in Afghanistan received their supplies. The task was given to the ISI's favourite Mujaheddin leader, Gulbuddin Hikmetyar. In March 1987, small units crossed the Amu Darya river from bases in northern Afghanistan and launched their first rocket attacks against villages in Tajikistan. Casey was delighted with the news, and on his next secret trip to Pakistan he crossed the border into Afghanistan with [the late Pakistani] President Zia [ul-Haq] to review the Mujaheddin groups. Thirdly, Casey committed CIA support to a long-standing ISI initiative to recruit radical Muslims from around the world to come to Pakistan and fight with the Afghan Mujaheddin. The ISI had encouraged this since 1982, and by now all the other players had their reasons for supporting the idea. President Zia aimed to cement Islamic unity, turn Pakistan into the leader of the Muslim world and foster an Islamic opposition in Central Asia. Washington wanted to demonstrate that the entire Muslim world was fighting the Soviet Union alongside the Afghans and their American benefactors. And the Saudis saw an opportunity both to promote Wahabbism [their strict and austere Wahabbi creed] and to get rid of its disgruntled radicals. None of the players reckoned on these volunteers having their own agendas, which would eventually turn their hatred against the Soviets on their own regimes and the Americans. Thousands of radicals come to study  . . Between 1982 and 1992, some 35,000 Muslim radicals from 43 Islamic countries in the Middle East, North and East Africa, Central Asia and the Far East would pass their baptism under fire with the Afghan Mujaheddin. Tens of thousands more foreign Muslim radicals came to study in the hundreds of new madrassas that Zia's military government began to fund in Pakistan and along the Afghan border. Eventually more than 100,000 Muslim radicals were to have direct contact with Pakistan and Afghanistan and be influenced by the jihad.  In camps near Peshawar and in Afghanistan, these radicals met each other for the first time and studied, trained and fought together. It was the first opportunity for most of them to learn about Islamic movements in other countries, and they forged tactical and ideological links that would serve them well in the future. The camps became virtual universities for future Islamic radicalism. None of the intelligence agencies involved wanted to consider the consequences of bringing together thousands of Islamic radicals from all over the world. "What was more important in the world view of history? The Taliban or the fall of the Soviet Empire? A few stirred-up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?" said Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former US National Security Adviser. American citizens woke up to the consequences only when Afghanistan-trained Islamic militants blew up the World Trade Center in New York in 1993, killing six people and injuring 1,000. "The war," wrote Samuel Huntington, "left behind an uneasy coalition of Islamist organizations intent on promoting Islam against all non-Muslim forces. It also left a legacy of expert and experienced fighters, training camps and logistical facilities, elaborate trans-Islam networks of personal and organization relationships, a substantial amount of military equipment including 300 to 500 unaccounted-for Stinger missiles, and, most important, a heady sense of power and self-confidence over what had been achieved and a driving desire to move on to other victories." A young Bin Laden  . . Among these thousands of foreign recruits was a young Saudi student, Osama Bin Laden, the son of a Yemeni construction magnate, Mohammed Bin Laden, who was a close friend of the late King Faisal and whose company had become fabulously wealthy on the contracts to renovate and expand the Holy Mosques of Mecca and Medina. The ISI had long wanted Prince Turki Bin Faisal, the head of Istakhbarat, the Saudi Intelligence Service, to provide a Royal Prince to lead the Saudi contingent in order to show Muslims the commitment of the Royal Family to the jihad. Only poorer Saudis, students, taxi drivers and Bedouin tribesmen had so far arrived to fight. But no pampered Saudi prince was ready to rough it out in the Afghan mountains. Bin Laden, although not a royal, was close enough to the royals and certainly wealthy enough to lead the Saudi contingent Bin Laden, Prince Turki and General Gut were to become firm friends and allies in a common cause.  The centre for the Arab-Afghans  [Filipino Moros, Uzbeks from Soviet Central Asia, Arabs from Algeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Uighurs from Xinjiang in China who had all come to fight with the Mujaheddin] was the offices of the World Muslim League and the Muslim Brotherhood in the northern Pakistan city of Peshawar. The center was run by Abdullah Azam, a Jordanian Palestinian whom Bin Laden had first met at university in Jeddah and revered as his leader. Azam and his two sons were assassinated by a bomb blast in Peshawar in 1989. During the 1980s, Azam had forged close links with Hikmetyar and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the Afghan Islamic scholar, whom the Saudis had sent to Peshawar to promote Wahabbism. Saudi funds flowed to Azam and the Makhtab at Khidmat or Services Center, which he created in 1984 to service the new recruits and receive donations from Islamic charities. Donations from Saudi Intelligence, the Saudi Red Crescent, the World Muslim League and private donations from Saudi princes and mosques were channelled through the Makhtab. A decade later, the Makhtab would emerge at the center of a web of radical organizations that helped carry out the World Trade Center bombing and the bombings of US embassies in Africa in 1998. Until he arrived in Afghanistan, Bin Laden's life had hardly been marked by anything extraordinary. He was born around 1957, the 17th of 57 children sired by his Yemeni father and a Saudi mother, one of Mohammed Bin Laden's many wives. Bin Laden studied for a masters degree in business administration at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah but soon switched to Islamic studies. Thin and tall, he is 6 feet 5 inches, with long limbs and a flowing beard. He towered above his contemporaries, who remember him as a quiet and pious individual but hardly marked out for greater things. His father backed the Afghan struggle and helped fund it, so when Bin Laden decided to join up, his family responded enthusiastically. He first traveled to Peshawar in 1980 and met the Mujaheddin leaders, returning frequently with Saudi donations for the cause until 1982, when he decided to settle in Peshawar. He brought in his company engineers and heavy construction equipment to help build roads and depots for the Mujaheddin. In 1986, he helped build the Khost tunnel complex, which the CIA was funding as a major arms storage depot, training facility and medical center for the Mujaheddin, deep under the mountains close to the Pakistan border. For the first time in Khost he set up his own training camp for Arab Afghans, who now increasingly saw this lanky, wealthy and charismatic Saudi as their leader.  . . Bin Laden later claimed to have taken part in ambushes against Soviet troops, but he mainly used his wealth and Saudi donations to build Mujaheddin projects and spread Wahabbism among the Afghans. After the death of Azam in 1989, he took over Azam's organization and set up Al Qaeda or Military Base as a service center for Arab-Afghans and their families and to forge a broad-based alliance among them. With the help of Bin Laden, several thousand Arab militants had established bases in the provinces of Kunar, Nuristan and Badakhshan, but their extreme Wahabbi practices made them intensely disliked by the majority of Afghans. Moreover, by allying themselves with the most extreme pro-Wahabbi Pashtun MuMeddin, the Arab-Afghans alienated the non-Pashtuns and the Shia Muslims. Upset by U.S. role in Gulf War  . . By 1990, Bin Laden was disillusioned by the internal bickering of the Mujaheddin and he returned to Saudi Arabia to work in the family business. He founded a welfare organization for Arab-Afghan veterans. Some 4,000 of them had settled in Mecca and Medina alone, and Bin Laden gave money to the families of those killed. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait he lobbied the Royal Family to organize a popular defense of the kingdom and raise a force from the Afghan war veterans to fight Iraq. Instead, King Fahd invited in the Americans. This came as an enormous shock to Bin Laden. As the 540,000 US troops began to arrive, Bin Laden openly criticized the Royal Family, lobbying the Saudi ulema to issue fatwas, religious rulings, against non-Muslims being based in the country.  . . In 1992, Bin Laden left for Sudan to take part in the Islamic revolution under way there under the charismatic Sudanese leader Hassan Turabi. Bin Laden's continued criticism of the Saudi Royal Family eventually annoyed them so much that they took the unprecedented step of revoking his citizenship in 1994. It was in Sudan, with his wealth and contacts, that Bin Laden gathered around him more veterans of the Afghan war, who were all disgusted by the American victory over Iraq and the attitude of the Arab ruling elites who allowed the US military to remain in the Gulf. As US and Saudi pressure mounted against Sudan for harboring Bin Laden, the Sudanese authorities asked him to leave. In May 1996, Bin Laden travelled back to Afghanistan, arriving in Jalalabad in a chartered jet with an entourage of dozens of Arab militants, bodyguards and family members, including three wives and 13 children. Here he lived under the protection of the Jalalabad Shura [an advisory body or assembly], until the conquest of Kabul and Jalalabad by the Taliban in September 1996. In August 1996, he had issued his first declaration of jihad against the Americans, whom he said were occupying Saudi Arabia. "The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets," the declaration read. Striking up a friendship with Mullah Omar, in 1997 he moved to Kandahar, Afghanistan, and came under the protection of the Taliban. By now, the CIA had set up a special cell to monitor his activities and his links with other Islamic militants. A US State Department report in August 1996 noted that Bin Laden was "one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world." The report said that Bin Laden was financing terrorist camps in Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Egypt and Afghanistan. In April 1996, President Clinton signed the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allowed the US to block assets of terrorist organizations. It was first used to block Bin Laden's access to his fortune of an estimated US$250-300 million. A few months later, Egyptian intelligence declared that Bin Laden was training 1,000 militants, a second generation of Arab-Afghans, to bring about an Islamic revolution in Arab countries. CIA tries snatch operation In early 1997, the CIA constituted a squad that arrived in Peshawar to try to carry out a snatch operation to get Bin Laden out of Afghanistan. The Americans enlisted Afghans and Pakistanis to help them but aborted the operation. The US activity in Peshawar helped persuade Bin Laden to move to the safer confines of Kandahar. On  23 February 1998, at a meeting in the original Khost camp, all the groups associated with Al Qaeda issued a manifesto under the aegis of "The International Islamic Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders." The manifesto stated "for more than seven years the US has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian peninsular, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbours, and turning its bases in the peninsular into a spearhead through which to fight the neighbouring Muslim peoples." The meeting issued a fatwa. "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies -- civilians and military -- is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to." Bin Laden had now formulated a policy that was not just aimed at the Saudi Royal Family or the Americans, but called for the liberation of the entire Muslim Middle East. As the American air war against Iraq escalated in 1998, Bin Laden called on all Muslims to "confront, fight and kill, Americans and Britons." 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings However, it was the bombings in August 1998 of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 220 people which made Bin Laden a household name in the Muslim world and the West. Just 13 days later, after accusing Bin Laden of perpetrating the attack, the USA retaliated by firing 70 cruise missiles against Bin Laden's camps around Khost and Jalalabad. Several camps which had been handed over by the Taliban to the Arab-Afghans and Pakistani radical groups were hit. The Al Badr camp controlled by Bin Laden and the Khalid bin Walid and Muawia camps run by the Pakistani Harakat ul Ansar were the main targets. Harakat used their camps to train militants for fighting Indian troops in Kashmir. Seven outsiders were killed in the strike -- three Yemenis, two Egyptians, one Saudi and one Turk. Also killed were seven Pakistanis and 20 Afghans. In November 1998 the USA offered a US$5-million reward for Bin Laden's capture. The Americans were further galvanized when Bin Laden claimed that it was his Islamic duty to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons to use against the USA. "It would be a sin for Muslims not to try to possess the weapons that would prevent infidels from inflicting harm on Muslims. Hostility toward America is a religious duty and we hope to be rewarded for it by God," he said.  . . After the Africa bombings, the US launched a truly global operation. More than 80 Islamic militants were arrested in a dozen different countries. Militants were picked up in a crescent running from Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan and Yemen to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and the Phillipines." In December 1998, Indian authorities detained Bangladeshi militants for plotting to bomb the US Consulate in Calcutta. Seven Afghan nationals using false Italian passports were arrested in Malaysia and accused of trying to start a bombing campaign." According to the FBI, militants in Yemen who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in December 1998 were funded by Bin Laden. In February 1999, Bangladeshi authorities said Bin Laden had sent US$l million to the Harkat-ul-Jihad (HJ) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, some of whose members had trained and fought in Afghanistan. HJ leaders said they wanted to turn Bangladesh into a Taliban-style Islamic state. Thousands of miles away in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania in West Africa, several militants were arrested who had also trained under Bin Laden in Afghanistan and were suspected of plotting bomb explosions. Meanwhile, during the trial of 107 Al-Jihad members at a military court in Cairo, Egyptian intelligence officers testified that Bin Laden had bankrolled Al-Jihad. In February 1999, the CIA claimed that through monitoring Bin Laden's communication network by satellite, they had prevented his supporters from carrying out seven bomb attacks against US overseas facilities in Saudi Arabia, Albania, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Uganda, Uruguay and the Ivory Coast -- emphasizing the reach of the Afghan veterans.   . . But it was Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the original sponsors of the Arab-Afghans, who suffered the most as their activities rebounded. In March 1997, three Arab and two Tajik militants [from Tajikistan] were shot dead after a 36-hour gun battle between them and the police in an Afghan refugee camp near Peshawar. Belonging to the Wahabbi radical Tafkir group, they were planning to bomb an Islamic heads of state meeting in Islamabad. Fighting in Kashmir against India With the encouragement of Pakistan, the Taliban and Bin Laden, Arab-Afghans had enlisted in the Pakistani party Harkat-ut-Ansar to fight in Kashmir against Indian troops. By inducting Arabs who introduced Wahabbi-style rules in the Kashmir valley, genuine Kashmiri militants felt insulted. The US government had declared Ansar a terrorist organization in 1996 and it had subsequently changed its name to Harkat-ul-Mujaheddin. All the Pakistani victims of the US missile strikes on Khost belonged to Ansar. In 1999, Ansar said it would impose a strict Wahabbi-style dress code in the Kashmir valley and banned jeans and jackets. On 15 February 1999, they shot and wounded three Kashmiri cable television operators for relaying Western satellite broadcasts. Ansar had previously respected the liberal traditions of Kashmiri Muslims, but the activities of the Arab-Afghans hurt the legitimacy of the Kashmiri movement and gave India a propaganda coup. Pakistan faced a problem when Washington urged Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to help arrest Bin Laden. The ISI's close contacts with Bin Laden, and the fact that he was helping fund and train Kashmiri militants who were using the Khost camps, created a dilemma for Sharif when he visited Washington in December 1998. Sharif sidestepped the issue but other Pakistani officials were more brazen, reminding their American counterparts how they had both helped midwife Bin Laden in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. Bin Laden himself pointed to continued support from some elements in the Pakistani intelligence services in an interview. "As for Pakistan there are some governmental departments, which, by the Grace of God, respond to the Islamic sentiments of the masses in Pakistan. This is reflected in sympathy and co-operation. However, some other governmental departments fell into the trap of the infidels. We pray to God to return them to the right path," said Bin Laden. Conundrums for Pakistan, Saudi Arabia Support for Bin Laden by elements within the Pakistani establishment was another contradiction in Pakistans Afghan policy. . . . The US was Pakistans closest ally, with deep links to the military and the ISI. But both the Taliban and Bin Laden provided sanctuary and training facilities for Kashmiri militants who were backed by Pakistan, and Islamabad had little interest in drying up that support. Even though the Americans repeatedly tried to persuade the ISI to cooperate in delivering Bin Laden, the ISI declined, although it did help the US arrest several of Bin Laden's supporters. Without Pakistans support, the United States could not hope to launch a snatch by US commandos or more accurate bombing strikes, because it needed Pakistani territory to launch such raids. At the same time, the USA dared not expose Pakistans support for the Taliban, because it still hoped for ISI cooperation in catching Bin Laden. The Saudi conundrum was even worse. In July 1998 Prince Turki had visited Kandahar and a few weeks later 400 new pick-up trucks arrived in Kandahar for the Taliban, still bearing their Dubai license plates. The Saudis also gave cash for the Taliban's cheque book conquest of the north in the autumn. Until the Africa bombings and despite US pressure to end their support for the Taliban, the Saudis continued funding the Taliban and were silent on the need to extradite Bin Laden. The truth about the Saudi silence was even more complicated. The Saudis preferred to leave Bin Laden alone in Afghanistan because his arrest and trial by the Americans could expose the deep relationship that Bin Laden continued to have with sympathetic members of the Royal Family and elements within Saudi intelligence, which could prove deeply embarrassing. The Saudis wanted Bin Laden either dead or a captive of the Taliban -- they did not want him captured by the Americans.  . . By now Bin Laden had developed considerable influence with the Taliban, but that had not always been the case. The Taliban's contact with the Arab-Afghans and their Pan-Islamic ideology was non-existent until the Taliban captured Kabul in 1996. Pakistan was closely involved in introducing Bin Laden to the Taliban leaders in Kandahar, because it wanted to retain the Khost training camps for Kashmiri militants, which were now in Taliban hands. Persuasion by Pakistan, the Taliban's better-educated cadres, who also had Pan-Islamic ideas, and the lure of financial benefits from Bin Laden, encouraged the Taliban leaders to meet with Bin Laden and hand him back the Khost camps. A life with the Taliban in Kandahar Partly for his own safety and partly to keep control over him, the Taliban shifted Bin Laden to Kandahar in 1997. At first he lived as a paying guest. He built a house for Mullah Omar's family and provided funds to other Taliban leaders. He promised to pave the road from Kandahar airport to the city and build mosques, schools and dams, but his civic works never got started as his funds were frozen. While Bin Laden lived in enormous style in a huge mansion in Kandahar with his family, servants and fellow militants, the arrogant behaviour of the Arab-Afghans who arrived with him and their failure to fulfill any of their civic projects antagonized the local population. The Kandaharis saw the Taliban leaders as beneficiaries of Arab largesse rather than the people. Bin Laden endeared himself further to the leadership by sending several hundred Arab-Afghans to participate in the 1997 and 1998 Taliban offensives in the north. These Wahabbi fighters helped the Taliban carry out massacres of the Shia Hazaras in the north. Several hundred Arab-Afghans, based in the Rishkor army garrison outside Kabul, fought on the Kabul front against [the Mujaheddin leader Ahmad Shah] Masud. Increasingly, Bin Laden's world view appeared to dominate the thinking of senior Taliban leaders. All-night conversations between Bin Laden and the Taliban leaders paid off. Until his arrival, the Taliban leadership had not been particularly antagonistic to the USA or the West but demanded recognition for their government. However, after the Africa bombings the Taliban became increasingly vociferous against the Americans, the UN, the Saudis and Muslim regimes around the world. Their statements increasingly reflected the language of defiance Bin Laden had adopted and wh!
h was not an original Taliban tr
ait. As US pressure on the Taliban to expel Bin Laden intensified, the Taliban said he was a guest and it was against Afghan tradition to expel guests. When it appeared that Washington was planning another military strike against Bin Laden, the Taliban tried to cut a deal with Washington -- to allow him to leave the country in exchange for US recognition. Thus, until the winter of 1998 the Taliban saw Bin Laden as an asset, a bargaining chip over whom they could negotiate with the Americans. The US State Department opened a satellite telephone connection to speak to Mullah Omar directly. The Afghanistan desk officers, helped by a Pushto translator, held lengthy conversations with Omar in which both sides explored various options, but to no avail. By early 1999 it began to dawn on the Taliban that no compromise with the US was possible and they began to see Bin Laden as a liability. A US deadline in February 1999 to the Tatiban to either hand over Bin Laden or face the consequences forced the Taliban to make him disappear discreetly from Kandahar. The move bought the Taliban some time, but the issue was still nowhere near being resolved. The Arab-Afghans had come full circle. From being mere appendages to the Afghan jihad and the Cold War in the 1980s they had taken centre stage for the Afghans, neighbouring countries and the West in the 1990s. . .  Afghanistan was now truly a haven for Islamic internationalism and terrorism and the Americans and the West were at a loss as to how to handle it.

Trust is the critical variable in Internet Commerce. Trust
requirements differentiate Internet from other forms of commerce.
Trust has three primary components: reliability, security, and
There is trust in routing, trust in encryption, and trust in
applications. The layers of trust, the areas of risk, the power of
cryptography, and the limits to security are all explained for the
general audience in this text.
When a business obtains customer data, the customer trusts that the
data are used to improve service for her, and not used in a manner
that harms her. The business is not necessarily violating privacy but
is certainly requiring some extension of trust from the customer.
This talk examines that trust relationship and examines the types of
data that are most immediately useful but the least used.
This talk contains explanations of fault tolerance and the components
of reliability. Most transactions today are not fault tolerant. If a
transaction is not reliable (in the sense of being fault tolerant)
someone is at risk when the transaction fails. It is therefore
important to be able to read a transaction-based Internet commerce
standard and understand from that the risks involved in using the

@_subject: Please make stable NON-US homes for strong crypto projects (fwd) 
It's clear that the US administration is putting out feelers to
again ban publication of strong encryption.  See:
  The evil gnomes who keep advancing unconstitutional US anti-crypto
policies know that the current hysteria in Congress and the
Administration will not last forever.  So they will probably move very
quickly -- within a week is my guess -- to re-control encryption,
either by a unilateral action of the Administration (by amending
the Export Administration Regulations), or by stuffing a rider onto
some so-called "emergency" bill in Congress.
They maneuvered very carefully in the Bernstein case such that there
is no outstanding injunction against violating the Constitution this
way -- and even no binding 9th-Circuit precedent that tells them it's
unconstitutional to do so.  They know in their hearts that numerous
judges have found it unconstitutional, but they have proven throughout
the seven-year history of the case that they don't give a damn about
the Constitution.  Which means it may take weeks, months or years for
civil liberties workers to get a judge to roll back any such action.
Not just days.  We won the case, but they squirmed out of any
permanent restrictions -- so far.
The US government has a new mania for wiretapping everyone in case
they might be a terrorist.  There's already two bills in Congress to
make it trivial for them to wiretap anybody on flimsy excuses, and to
retroactively justify their precipitous act of rolling Carnivore boxes
into major ISPs this week and demanding, without legal authority, that
they be put at the heart of the networks.  See:
  Even more than before, we will need good encryption tools, merely to
maintain privacy for law-abiding citizens, political activists, and
human rights workers.  (In the current hysteria, mere messages
advocating peace or Constitutional rights might best be encrypted.)
The European Parliament also recently recommended that European
communications be routinely encrypted to protect them from pervasive
US Echelon wiretaps.
Some US developers, who thought such a reversal would never happen,
have built or maintained a number of good open source encryption tools
in the United States, and may not have lined up solid foreign
maintainers or home sites.
LET'S FIX THAT!  We need volunteers in many countries to mirror
current distributions, CVS trees, etc.  We need volunteers to also
act as maintainers, accepting patches and integrating them into
solid releases.
(Note that too many countries have pledged to stand toe-to-toe with the
US while they march off to make war on somebody they can't figure out
who it is yet.  If you live in one of those countries, you may
suddenly find that your own crypto regs have been sneakily altered.
Take care that each useful package has maintainers and distribution
points in diverse countries.)
I haven't kept close track of which packages are in danger.  I
suggest that people nominate packages on this mailing list, and that
others immediately grab mirror copies of them as they are nominated.
And that some of those who mirror them keep quiet, in case hysterical
governments make a concerted effort to stamp out all copies and/or all
major distribution sites.  If you aren't the quiet type, then *AFTER*
IMMEDIATELY PULLING A COPY OF THE CODE OUTSIDE US JURISDICTION,
announce your mirror on this mailing list.
We freedom-loving US citizens have had to rely on the freedom-loving
citizens of saner countries, to do the work of making strong
encryption, for many years.  We had a brief respite, which we will
eventually resume for good.  In the meantime, please let me apologize
for my countrymen and for my government, for asking you to shoulder
most of the burden again.  Thank you so much.
PS: Companies with proprietary encryption packages might consider
immediately open-sourcing and exporting their encryption add-ins, so
their customers can still get them from overseas archives.  Or taking
other actions to safeguard the privacy and integrity of their
customers' data and their society's infrastructure.  I also advise
that they lobby like hell to keep privacy and integrity legal in the US.

Reply-To: cypherpunks
2001 September 12
An Open Letter on Privacy and Anonymity
Fellow Citizens of the United States of America:
I am moved to write as a founder of a movement that, far beyond my own efforts, has eloquently expressed an ideal, the ideal of privacy in society.  Privacy is not uniquely American, yet it is at the core of the American ideal, at the core of free speech that enables human connection, at the core of free association that builds society up from a savage state, at the core of liberty.  I helped to start cypherpunks, a movement for privacy in the digital world.  Cypherpunks is a diverse movement with no explicit doctrine, yet with a deep shared desire for human liberty.
Let none who call me friend say that the events of September 11 are anything other than a dark day upon humanity.  In the midst of the violence, I see a thirst for the taste of the blood of vengeance in the mouths of many of my fellow citizens.  I see that destruction will ineluctably ride upon the opponents of the country of these my fellow citizens.  So be it.  I do not seek here to forestall or to avoid the violence directed toward the perpetrators of these deeds.
I write as a citizen of the United States that our country may avoid a self-inflicted wound against liberty.  The terrorists have struck a blow against liberty, it is said.  The terrorists will strike again, it is said.  I say to all, let us not strike the second blow against ourselves.  Today we are seeking an enemy unknown, an enemy who is hiding, as well they ought to.  The thirst that drives our country forward now cannot be slaked without the apprehension of those responsible, and we have yet to identify or find them.  We now have a great temptation before us, to lash out at those amongst ourselves who may be thought to have given succor to our enemies, at those amongst ourselves who may be thought to still provide them solace and deception, and at those amongst ourselves whom some dislike for unrelated reasons.
I wish to repeat again the words of Governor Davis of California, who spoke yesterday that "we are all Americans."  We are all Americans, and we should not attack ourselves.  We are all Americans, and we should not fight each other in the streets.  We are all Americans, and we should not turn our law enforcement apparatus and our national security infrastructure against the very liberties that we all hold dear.  The goal of these terrorists is to restrict freedoms in America, to steal its essence and to weaken it.  I shall pray we do not cooperate with this their goal in a hot-headed rush to immediate results.  Let the anger of this country be cold and calmly directed, that the accompaniment of wrath be precision.
The terrorists are cowards, it is said.  Shall America be a coward to itself?  We have an excess of strength to expend upon our opponents, be they external or internal.  We will find that there are internal champions of liberty that have without conspiracy or knowledge furthered the plans of our opponents, who have taken advantage of the liberties that America offers all who enter her shores.  Many of these champions I know personally, because cypherpunks have enabled liberty on-line to all takers, without discrimination and without distinction.  Let the prevailing wrath be directed not against those to promote liberty, but those who consciously seek to destroy it.
We need not curtail our liberty in order to save it.  The message is seductive that we may more effectively fight for liberty if we limit our freedoms for a time whose end has yet to be announced.  Yet this is not the message of America, but of several of its vanquished enemies.  For liberty is not fair-weather clothing that may only be worn when the weather is good.  Liberty is rather the jewel in the locket, the most prized possession short of family and life itself.  We diminish ourselves if we rationalize our freedom away in an evanescent fog of rhetoric about efficiency.  Liberty is not efficient; it is expensive and tortuous, and as an American people we desire it before most everything else.
As we enter a new century, let us demonstrate the true strength of an open society -- that it can withstand the threat of demagoguery even as it remains a powerful actor against an external threat.  This is the ideal that our strength may manifest, that a democracy may express its power as a democracy itself, and not as a police state masquerading as one.
I stand with the Federal Congress and sing "America, my home, sweet home."  For I live upon this land and soil, with other people who have set their lives along the course of freedom.  I pray that we may all pass through this dark time with the dignity of our own ideals intact, that we may pass through to the other side with renewed vigor to pursue the cause of freedom over all the earth.  My heart grieves with those who have lost, yet it also rejoices that we might yet undergo this ordeal as a country and emerge stronger and more faithful to our own nature.
May peace be with you all, with the fullness of your existence in tow.
Eric Hughes

Office of the Spokesman
Worldwide Caution
September 12, 2001
The events of September 11 at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and
Somerset, Pennsylvania, serve as a cruel reminder of the continuing threat
from terrorists and extremist groups to Americans and American interests
worldwide. This situation remains fluid and American citizens should be
aware of the potential risks and to take these into consideration when
making travel plans. The Department will continue to develop information
about potential threats to Americans overseas and to share credible threat
information through its Consular Information Program documents available on
the Internet at As the U.S. Government has reported in Public Announcements over the last
several months, U.S. citizens and interests abroad may be at increased risk
of terrorist actions from extremist groups. Most recently, we advised that
we had unconfirmed information that terrorist actions may be taken against
U.S. military facilities and/or establishments frequented by U.S. military
personnel in Korea and Japan. In addition, we continue to be concerned about
information we received in May 2001 that American citizens may be the target
of a terrorist threat from extremist groups with links to Usama Bin Ladin's
Al-Qaida organization. In the past, such individuals have not distinguished
between official and civilian targets. We take this information seriously.
In light of the above information, U.S. Government facilities worldwide
remain at a heightened state of alert.
U.S. citizens are urged to maintain a high level of vigilance and to
increase their security awareness. Americans should maintain a low profile,
vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail and packages
from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. American citizens are also urged to
avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar objects, and to report the
presence of the objects to local authorities. Vehicles should not be left
unattended and should be kept locked at all times. U.S. Government personnel
overseas have been advised to take the same precautions.
U.S. citizens planning to travel abroad should consult the Department of
State's Public Announcements, Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets,
and regional travel brochures, all of which are available at the Consular
Affairs Internet website  at
 We will continue to provide updated information
should it become available. American citizens overseas may contact the
American Citizens Services unit of the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate by
telephone or fax for up-to-date information on security conditions. American
citizens in need of emergency assistance should telephone the nearest U.S.
Embassy or Consulate before visiting there. U.S. Government facilities have
and will continue to temporarily close or suspend public services as
necessary to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy. In those
instances, U.S. Missions will make every effort to provide emergency
services to American citizens.
In addition to information on the Internet, U.S. travelers may hear recorded
information by calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive information by
automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from their fax machine.
This Public Announcement supersedes the Public Announcement - Worldwide
Caution of September 7, 2001, to inform U.S. citizens of of our continued
concern about safety and security overseas in light of the events of
September 11. This Public Announcement expires on March 12, 2002.

According to some teenagers "reportedly cracked an encryption technology called Data
Encryption Standard (DES)".  I'm skeptical, but I thought I'd toss it out.  Anyone have any details?

@_subject: The tragedy in NYC (fwd) 
[I sent this originally yesterday, but the, er, problems our mail
server in downtown New York suffered for a while caused some
delay. Another copy was published on Dave Farber's interesting
people. Several people wrote me afterwards vilifying me. Ah well.
The list is now running on a new machine in Virginia, which
should be safe even as more buildings collapse and burn.  --Perry]
In the wake of the tragedy in NYC today, I was asked by someone if I
didn't now agree that crypto was a munition. At the time, I thought
that a friend of mine was likely dead. (I've since learned he escaped
in time.)
My answer then, when I thought I'd lost a friend, was the same as my
answer now and the answer I've always had.
Cryptography must remain freely available to all.
In coming months, politicians will flail about looking for freedoms to
eliminate to "curb the terrorist threat". They will see an opportunity
to grandstand and enhance their careers, an opportunity to show they
are "tough on terrorists".
We must remember throughout that you cannot preserve freedom by
eliminating it. The problem is not a lack of laws banning things.
I know the pressure on everyone in Washington will be to "do
something". Speaking as a New Yorker who dearly loves this city, who
has felt deep shock throughout most of the day, watching the smoke
still rising from the fires to the south of me, listening to the
ambulances and police cars continuing to wail about me, let me say
this:    I do not want more laws passed in the name of defending my home.
   I do not want more freedoms eliminated to "preserve freedom".
   I do not want to trade my freedom for safety. Franklin has said far
   more eloquently than me why that is worthless.
If you must do something, send out more investigators to find those
responsible for this and bring them to justice. Pass no new laws. Take
away no freedoms. Do not destroy the reason I live here to give me
"safety". I'd rather die in a terrorist attack.

* PGP opens up complete encryption source code
September 7th, 2001
One of the first encryption products is made available to all.  PGP
Security -- a division of Network Associates that has been criticised in
the past for being too proprietary -- has made available the electronic
distribution of its complete source code for the PGPsdk, its cryptographic
toolkit. PGP, which was one of the world's first encryption products and a
de facto standard for encryption, is the foundation of all PGP Desktop,
Wireless and Server products.  The release of the source code will provide
academic researchers and cryptographers the ability to review every detail
of PGPsdk's cryptographic features. The move comes a short time after the
US government recently relaxed export regulations on cryptographic source
code, Santa Clara, California-based PGP Security said. All of article.
* Quantum Crypto to the Rescue
September 7th, 2001
This week has been big for cryptography.  It's seen both technical and
theoretical advances in next-generation quantum crypto systems and
technology.  It's seen a prototype enter its testing phase that could send
secret crypto keys through open air to a satellite or across town.

considered bad form, logically speaking.
As to the point, if nations can't participate in terrorism then exactly
what is it that Afghanistan is being theatened with for harboring the

War - conflict by force of arms, as between nations
Terrorism - calculated use of violence, mayhem, and murder to inspire
            terror.
It's a question of scale, not participants. A nation can engage in
terrorism (eg Syria, Libya).

Considering your logic so far, this doesn't surprise me.
Exactly, and you ASSUMED A PRIORI that I would accept your definitions
without stipulation.
Since you're the representative of the 'government' and are making the
prooposal it is standard practice that the 'opposition' get to question
the definitions for relevency.
I did, you lost. Your definition of 'war' and 'terrorism' are inaccurate.
The claim that there is some 'legal definition' that prevents 'nations' or
'states' from participating in 'terrorism' is inaccurate. Even the US
(whose laws I'm ASSUMING you're are refering to) recognizes 'state
sponsored terrorism'.
In short the very pillars of your argument have been demonstrated to be
false. Your argument failed.
In responce you're not ingaging in straw man and ad hominim hoping that
nobody will notice.
Come back when you can play with adults.

Reply-To: InfoSec News BY WHITFIELD DIFFIE AND SUSAN LANDAU
For more than two centuries Americans have prided themselves on
protecting their freedom by limiting the concentration of power. With
its famous balance of power, the U.S. Constitution divides federal
power among the three branches of government, while the Bill of Rights
provides other checks all of which have served the country well.
With new threats have come new protections. In the nineteenth century,
corporations grew and multiplied, and some amassed the kind of power
we had always sought to limit in our own government. Anti-trust laws
were passed to guarantee that commercial power would be distributed
among competing companies in every sector of business.
These protections have also served us well.
But now a new threat has arisen that may be less obvious but more
While computer and communication technology have enhanced our lives in
many ways, they have also caused fundamental changes that make
protecting ourselves from the concentration of power more
difficult--in part because these technologies have made it feasible to
build organizations that are larger and more globally-distributed than
ever before. The result: we need to be more alert to potential abuses
of power.
The fact that everything is interconnected makes it possible to
concentrate power in a new way. A business that holds a monopoly in
one area may be able to use its influence to extend its monopoly in
entirely new ways. This is what is happening as Microsoft attempts to
extend its monopoly over personal computer operating systems into the
Internet world.
Microsoft .NET (pronounced dot net') is a far-reaching project to
channel the personal information of all customers who browse, shop,
and congregate on the Internet into Microsoft or Microsoft-controlled
companies. It is made up of components: Passport establishes an
individual's identity on the Internet .NET My Services collects
various pieces of private information--including .NET Contacts, .NET
Location, .NET Inbox, .NET Documents, .NET Devices, and .NET Wallet.
The control over computer software that Microsoft has achieved through
its dominance of operating systems has limited competition and
innovation throughout the computer field.  Through .NET, it is
attempting to exert the same control over all Internet commerce. Just
as kings got to grant or deny royal charters to businesses, the
Redmond giant, if successful, may be able to say who can do business
on the Net and who can't.
But there is another and more immediate problem with .NET--something
that could evolve from a problem to a national crisis even if
Microsoft is well behaved or well regulated in the use of its new
powers.  That is the problem of security, as opposed to privacy.
What is the difference? If Microsoft knows everything about
everyone--and the information being collected by Passport and My
Services make that look quite likely--the company could still be
constrained in how it uses that information by laws or corporate
privacy policies. That presupposes, however, that Microsoft is
actually in control of the information it has collected.
Microsofts security record is nothing to brag about. Windows is the
most widely used yet one of the least secure operating systems around.
Microsoft programs have shown themselves vulnerable to worms, viruses,
and break-ins, on Microsoft's own computers and on everybody else's.
The Melissa virus spread through Microsoft's word processing and
e-mail programs, sending itself to the first 50 people in each of the
infected machine's address lists. A year later the ILOVEYOU virus
infected the Web through a different part of Microsofts e-mail
package. More recently Microsoft's own internal systems were hacked,
and the intruders spent over a month accessing system source code,
likened to Microsoft's crown jewels, before their unlawful entry was
Why should Passport be any different? Early security analyses show
that compromises made for the sake of universal availability make
Passport less secure than it might have been, less secure than it
should be, and perhaps just plain insecure. The My Services databases
will be a particularly ripe target for hackers. (Since all users of
Microsoft's free Hotmail service have Passports, many unknowingly,
there are already 160 million Passport users.)
Remember, Willie Sutton used to rob banks because that's where the
money is.
Suppose that in a year or two Microsoft has succeeded in funneling the
lion's share of information about people's identities, preferences,
financial assets, and shopping habits to itself and putting them all
in one big database. If Microsoft can't protect its own systems: what
hope is there for Microsoft databases that will contain the credit,
locations, and private files of millions upon millions of users?
Suppose somebody breaks in. Everyone's personal and financial
information would suddenly be in the hands of the intruders. Or
worse--they could be scattered about in a series of resulting
malfunctions. The extent of the financial, social, and political
disaster that could result is hard to imagine.
If history has shown us anything, it's that the best protection lies
in decentralizing power and promoting competition. We need to take the
same approach to our digital identities and make sure that who and
what we are is not held captive by a single entity.

An OS without a computer is worthless. What drives the architecture of
OS'es (other than mental mastrubation) is applications and applications
environments. In the very late 60's there was a growth in the
computers::person ratio coupled with a great increase in  as a
whole. This led to a problem of scale and scope. Problems that Unix was
able to resolve in a usable way (as 30 years of use will attest). Most
other OS'es weren't. Not that Unix was the only alternative (eg C/PM).
However, the sorts of problems used in a day to day business/activity
creates a 'natural' schism. That is based around the distinctions between
design/engineering and business-home/industry. Unix found a first home in
the first. The 'smaller' OS'es found homes in the second. Each expanded
into the others realm until today. Whence we have several set of originaly
niche market solutions. These solutions have now saturated the market.
However, there are forces that are changing the market radicaly. Moving
from a real 'network is the computer' model. The reality is that the four
horsemen of the network (software, hardware, infrastructure, law) are
going to be replaced in the next 5 or so years with an almost completely
different model. These differences will serve to amplify the current
stresses and schisms in our societies.

@_subject: Re: [9fans] What makes Plan 9 unique? (fwd) 
Reply-To: 9fans
Why Plan 9?
Why Plan 9 indeed.  Isn't Plan 9 just another Unix clone?  Who cares?
First, Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface.  Once
you've settled in, there are very few surprises here, whereas Windows
still surprises me once in a while (though, to its credit, not as much
as older versions did).  After I switched to Linux from Windows 3.1, I
noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior in Windows 3.1 that Linux
did not have.  Switching to Plan 9 from Linux highlighted just as much
in Linux.
One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the
luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and
features added where they belong, rather than where they can be.  For
example, there is no tty driver in the kernel.  The window system
handles the nuances of terminal input.
If Plan 9 were just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth
using, or it might not.  The neat things start happening with
user-level file servers and per-process namespace.  Recall that in
Unix, /dev/tty refers to the current window's output device, and means
different things to different processes.  This is a special hack
enabled by the kernel for a single file.  Plan 9 provides full-blown
per-process namespaces.  Thus, in Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the
current window's output device, and means different things to
different processes, but the window system (or telnet daemon, or ssh
daemon, or whoever) arranges this, and does the same for /dev/mouse,
Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers the
kernel need not know about things like DOS's FAT file system or
Linux's EXT2 file system or NFS, etc.  Instead, user-level servers
provide this functionality when desired.  In Plan 9, even FTP is
provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server
appear in /n/ftp.
We need not stop at physical file systems, though.  Other file servers
synthesize files that represent other resources.  For example, upas/fs
presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox.  This models
the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.
As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file
system, one file per track.  If it's a writable CD, copying new files
into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories creates new audio or
data tracks.  Want to fixate the CD as audio or data?  Remove one of
the directories.
Finally, Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment.  Since files
or directory trees can be imported from other machines, and all
resources are files or directory trees, it's easy to share resources.
Want to use a different machine's sound card?  Import its /dev/audio.
Want to debug processes that run on another machine?  Import its
its /net.  And so on.

No Open Source license has that big a penetration into the market when
compared to non-Open Source. Half a smidjen and a smidjen, when faced with
a dump trunk...
In addition, the Open Source movement is less than 20 years old, approx.
ten years old with respect to providing real alternatives to closed
source. That's a pretty short period as things go to be making claims of
stability of any sort, including licenses.
No, they're concerned with making money. They have to live with licenses.
Sure didn't slow down the Open Source folks.
By this argument you should be a real proponent of the Closed Source model
ALL license speak to ghosts in the closet. If somebody didn't have some
sort of goal involved they wouldn't license the software in the first
place (it wouldn't even be written). The distinction between some group of
teenagers or college kids and your favorite corporation is specious. The
only difference is the number of marbles in the bucket.
Which is a major disadvantage in my book.
But it doesn't preclude them via other channels. To say that simply
because the water got dirty when we washed the baby we shouldn't keep the
baby just doesn't work for me. Hint, the software is not the point, ever.
The reality is that simply because the 'standard corporate model' doesn't
work with Open Source is an obvious consequence of understanding the
intent of Open Source and should surprise nobody.
Which simply demonstrates why these failed efforts simply support the
rule. Open Source is a totaly different head.
No users, no point in doing the software. I have to disagree. Irrespective
of intent or scale the customer must come first in all situations.
Developers don't buy products (or services as a consequence of use) at
anywhere the scale of consumers. Developers also don't do service.
Of this I agree.
That's fine if you can deal with the 'inertia' of the 'escrow'...it's
actually counter productive to all concerned in the vast majority of
cases. One of the hopes (admittedly not realized to a great extent to
date) of Open Source was one of innovation. Of providing a forum for
experimentation that was low cost but high quality.
For users the compatibility they care about is, will the product co-exist.
Outside of that most users couldn't care less. Distributors want to sell
whatever will solve customer issues and increase their ROI, $.
If you want to understand a situation; follow the $$$, not the lawyers.

No, such a policy is nothing more than 'might makes right' and 'mob rule'
in the worst sort of way. What makes your 'oppression' any diffrent than
theirs?      When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
     people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them
     with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the
     separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of
     Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
     mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
     them to the separation.
     We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
     pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments
     are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
     consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government
     becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People
     to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
     its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
     such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
     Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that
     Governments long established should not be changed for light and
     transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that
     mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
     than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are
     accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
     pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce
     them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their
     duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for
     their future security....
That's an assertion not a 'fact'. I look forward to your 'proof'. You
might start with Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and work from there.
Somebody around here doesn't understand the concept of 'freedom of
choice'. It is based around a incorrect understanding of 'citizen' and
'government'. To say 'all government' is abusive is to state in equivalent
terms 'all people' are abusive.
You make a distinction between 'people' and 'government' that is not
warranted by the facts.

Hardly. I just happen to be the Mongoose in a pit of snakes, so it should
surprise nobody (especially the snakes) if they all hiss.
The bottem line is you say 'fair' is whatever the two parties 'agree' to.
All you've done is shift the focus from 'fair' to 'agree'. And that shifts
the focus of the question as well. What does it mean to 'agree'.
And to answer another question 'is' means 'equivalent to' or 'identical
with' depending on context. Both acceptable here.
This is especially enlightening coming from a group (CACL, not Cypherpunks
per se) who claim that 'free markets' are the epitome of utopian
strategies (and 'free' most definitely has a significant and particular
meaning in this context - and it doesn't support yorur view). You're only
proving my point. Thank you.

Actually it makes perfect sense, if you understand how a farm works. The
farmers are competing against the environment, their own limited knowledge
and resources, and time.
Do you seriously want to propose that a chicken craps a combine? That the
seeds for the various crop rotations simply drop from the sky like manna?
That it'll always rain just enough, and therefore there won't be a need
for irridation ditches down to the local crick? And what about all that
animal feed? And the wood for the fence posts and the wire for the wire? Now, how many people does that one person farm now need to hire in order to get
all the infrastructure and support services running, before we even get
around to feeding ourselves?
A self-sufficient farm is either a very low-tech endeavour (which reduces
your needs) or else it grows according to economy of scales.

They're not contradictory because the market they exist in now isn't
'free'. Just another example of your poor reasoning. Telling somebody
'quite taking advantage of that person' is not the same thing as 'give
that that or else'.
What is contradictory is to say one believes in a 'free market' and then
actively support a non-free market by such commentary as you provide
above. "If they don't like it, they can leave."; never mind they can't
leave. Very convenient that.

Then you agree that their conditions aren't reasonable.
As to 'economic growth', that implies you have either the time or the
place to look for alternatives. These are not universal, especially in a
market where some parties act with intent to restrain other parties.
Read the first two para's of the DoI as to why this isn't as big an issue
as you might think, provided you get out early enough.
Yeah, like keeping them around just one more year so we can put just that much more in the treasury.
Historically dictators and such have not(!) acted to improve their
citizens lot in life, if the citizens get any improvement it's because
the powers that be recognize the situation and are hoping to stabilize it (so that their income streams are stabalized). They're not doing it for
the people, it's self-preservation.
No it isn't. It's about getting the fundamental government-corporate
rights and civil liberties infrastructure in place in these countries.

And they can be 'free' ONLY if all parties act fairly. A player in a game
most certainly does NOT have a 'free' choice if one or more players are
The bottom line, a choice can only be called 'free' if it is
unconstrained. That means that the party making it not only is
unconstrained but is informed of all(!) potential choices and outcomes.
Unfortunately the world isn't that clear, so we get constrained choices.
The question then becomes are they 'internal' or 'external' constraints.
If they are external then they are not 'fair' and the choices made under
those constraints can't be called 'free' under any rational definition of
'free' or 'rational'.

'agree' is synonymous with 'free' in this case. All you're doing is
playing word games and hand waving.
What does it mean to 'agree'? Is an agreement that one can backout of with
no consequences the same as an agreement where they break your leg if you
don't? Are those agreements the same? No.

Computers intended for single-user interactive processing. When looking at
cost/performance/feature for the OS'es current in the late 60's none were
really effective (I'm excluding Language-in-ROM machines - not that any of
them were stellar in performance). What would one day become engineering
workstations and personal computers (which are the same thing today).
A new class of machines was coming out (my first machine was a PDP 8e
running BASIC) and while there were plenty of tools they tended to be
vertical in intent or else not general purpose enough for this sort of
computing. Look at the first couple of years of Byte or Dr. Dobb's for
more specific examples (remember Godbout?) in the personal computer
Which happens to be one of the primary reasons Unix was developed, there
were no realistic choices in the market for this paradigm. So a solution
can trotting along.
We're facing the same sort of thing today with respect to 'grid computing'
and such. All the current OS'es (Linux incl.) are focused on the old style
of solutions. We'll also find that our current views of what IP means will
be found to be as antiquated.

This entire view misses the(!) one most important component of Unix's (and
Linux's) success, they were first.
There was NO credible competition. The same thing can be said for Apache
and BIND and many other apps. It isn't that they were the best, they were
simply the first - and get to reap market inertia as a result.
However, and it's a doozy, this won't last. As the Open Source market
expands and takes over pretty much completely you'll see this dominance
begin to decrease.
Why? Because of the component nature of the software.

Right, that's why there are so many of them out there...
Interaction between licenses for who?...
You're using a flawed model. There are three 'roles'; author, distributor,
user. Any license must interact with all three roles. The fact is that the
license doesn't effect the developer nearly as much as the distributor and
the end user. You're only looking at a single layer of interactions.
There is another aspect you're completely ignoring, unless one license
prohibits(!) use with another license the interaction (outside of "Can I
make money off it?") is nil - both for developers and users.
Utility, which license brings the maximum benefit to all three roles.
Yes, it is.
One shoe doesn't fit all.

It has two advantages over a strict free market model however. The fist
is the market is larger with respect to ability to cover damages because
it spreads the cost out over a larger group. This has two effects. First
it lowers the average cost per user and second during critical
emergencies you can raise larger sums of capital by increasing the
average payout. Especially damages that accrue all at once outside of
'normal' statistical expectations. A sequence of man made and natural
disasters would be one example. The flip side is to realize that this
works for transient spikes only. Otherwise it's simply robbing Peter to
pay Paul (ie Communism).
The second aspect is that the market players are likely to be more stable
from a total lifetime perspective. In some cases this accrues from the
stability of the government, in others this economic breadth stabalizes
the government.

@_subject: [psychohistory] A Terrorist's Nursery (fwd) 
Reply-To: psychohistory
The following article appeared in the INDEPENDET and, in IMO, presends well
the Psychohistorical case of the 'making of terrorists'.
I make some comments at the bottom of the message.
Robert Fisk: As the refugees crowd the borders, we'll be blaming someone
'It is palpably evident that they are not fleeing the Taliban but our bombs
and missiles'
23 October 2001
Mullah Mohammed Omar's 10-year-old son is dead. He was, according to Afghan
refugees fleeing Kandahar, taken to one of the city's broken hospitals by
his father, the Taliban leader and "Emir of the Faithful", but the boy -
apparently travelling in Omar's car when it was attacked by US aircraft -
died of his wounds.
No regrets, of course. Back in 1985, when American aircraft bombed Libya,
they also destroyed the life of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's six-year-old
adopted daughter. No regrets, of course. In 1992, when an Israeli pilot
flying an American-made Apache helicopter fired an American-made missile
into the car of Said Abbas Moussawi, head of the Hizbollah guerrilla army in
Lebanon, the Israeli pilot also killed Moussawi's 10-year-old. No regrets,
of course.
Whether these children deserved their deaths, be sure that their fathers -
in our eyes - were to blame. Live by the sword, die by the sword - and that
goes for the kids too. Back in 1991, The Independent revealed that American
Gulf War military targets included "secure" bunkers in which members of
Saddam Hussein's family - or the families of his henchmen - were believed to
be hiding. That's how the Americans managed to slaughter well over 300
people in an air raid shelter at Amariya in Baghdad. No Saddam kids, just
civilians. Too bad. I wonder - now that President George Bush has given
permission to the CIA to murder Osama bin Laden - if the same policy applies
And so the casualties begin to mount. From Kandahar come ever more frightful
stories of civilians buried under ruins, of children torn to pieces by
American bombs. The Taliban - and here the Americans must breathe a
collective sigh of relief - refuse to allow Western journalists to enter the
country to verify these reports. So when a few television crews were able to
find 18 fresh graves in the devastated village of Khorum outside Jalalabad
just over a week ago, the US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld could
ridicule the deaths as "ridiculous". But not, I suspect, for much longer.
For if each of our wars for infinite justice and eternal freedom have a
familiar trade mark - the military claptrap about air superiority,
suppression of "command and control centres", radar capabilities - each has
an awkward, highly exclusive little twist to it. In 1999, Nato claimed it
was waging war to put Kosovo Albanian refugees back in their homes - even
though most of the refugees were still in their homes when the war began.
Our bombing of Serbia led directly to their dispossession. We bear a heavy
burden of responsibility for their suffering - since the Serbs had told us
what they would do if Nato opened hostilities - although the ultimate blame
for their "ethnic cleansing'' clearly belonged to Slobodan Milosevic.
But Nato's escape clause won't work this time round. For as the Afghan
refugees turn up in their thousands at the border, it is palpably evident
that they are fleeing not the Taliban but our bombs and missiles. The
Taliban is not ethnically cleansing its own Pashtun population. The refugees
speak vividly of their fear and terror as our bombs fall on their cities.
These people are terrified of our "war on terror'', victims as innocent as
those who were slaughtered in the World Trade Centre on 11 September. So
where do we stop?
It's an important question because, once the winter storms breeze down the
mountain gorges of Afghanistan, a tragedy is likely to commence, one which
no spin doctor or propaganda expert will be able to divert. We'll say that
the thousands about to die or who are dying of starvation and cold are
victims of the Taliban's intransigence or the Taliban's support for
"terrorism" or the Taliban's propensity to steal humanitarian supplies.
I have to admit - having been weaned on Israel's promiscuous use of the word
"terror" every time a Palestinian throws a stone at his occupiers - that I
find the very word "terrorism" increasingly mendacious as well as racist. Of
course - despite the slavish use of the phrase "war on terrorism" on the BBC
and CNN - it is nothing of the kind. We are not planning to attack Tamil
Tiger suicide bombers or Eta killers or Real IRA murderers or Kurdish KDP
guerrillas. Indeed, the US has spent a lot of time supporting terrorists in
Latin America - the Contras spring to mind - not to mention the rabble we
are now bombing in Afghanistan. This is, as I've said before, a war on
America's enemies. Increasingly, as the date of 11 September acquires iconic
status, we are retaliating for the crimes against humanity in New York and
Washington. But we're not setting up any tribunals to try those responsible.
The figure of 6,000 remains as awesome as it did in the days that followed.
But what happens when the deaths for which we are responsible begin to
approach the same figure? Refugees have been telling me on the Pakistan
border that the death toll from our bombings in Afghanistan is in the
dozens, perhaps the hundreds. Once the UN agencies give us details of the
starving and the destitute who are dying in their flight from our bombs, it
won't take long to reach 6,000. Will that be enough? Will 12,000 dead
Afghans appease us, albeit that they have nothing to do with the Taliban or
Osama bin Laden? Or 24,000? If we think we know what our aims are in this
fraudulent "war against terror", have we any idea of proportion?
Sure, we'll blame the Taliban for future tragedies. Just as we've been
blaming them for drug exports from Afghanistan. Tony Blair was at the
forefront of the Taliban-drug linkage. And all we have to do to believe this
is to forget the UN Drug Control Programme's announcement last week that
opium production in Afghanistan has fallen by 94 per cent, chiefly due to
Mullah Omar's prohibition in Taliban-controlled areas. Most of Afghanistan's
current opium production comes - you've guessed it - from our friends in the
Northern Alliance.
This particular war is, as Mr Bush said, going to be "unlike any other" -
but not in quite the way he thinks. It's not going to lead to justice. Or
freedom. It's likely to culminate in deaths that will diminish in magnitude
even the crime against humanity on 11 September. Do we have any plans for
this? Can we turn the falsity of a "war against terror" into a war against
famine and starvation and death, even at the cost of postponing our day of
reckoning with Osama bin Laden?
Historicaly reprisals of a 10-fold of a 100-fold magnitude never worked in
the favore of those commiting them. Making a 'little' New York every day in
Afganistan, or anyware for that matter, just guarantees the creation of more
willing to die terrorists.
Of course 'our' governments already know this, thus an issue arrises: What's
in the long term agenda, if anything? The rhetiric and the 'official'
reasons given, ie. hunting down terrorists, retaliation to the patrons of
the Sept 11th events, punishing the guilty have only a short term value,
even without the cosideration of 'collateral damage', and will ultimately
lead to the creation of more willing to die terrorists. (Due to a mechanism
I call the "remaining leaven" - No matter the terrorists' death toll even
a - statisticaly expected - tiny bit of terrorist "yeast" will produce the
nesecary "leaven" that will fuel their future moves.
So, I speculate that there might be something more in it all...

It's a false distinction. What it boils down to is two or more groups
taking up arms to control all groups. One can eulogize about ethics and
morality until the cows come home. Won't change the basic fact that any
such conclusions are not only arbitrary but transient. There is no
absolute right and wrong outside of human psychology. The American
colonist certainly qualified in the 'terrorist' department with their
burning of warehouses and physical assaults on British sympathisers. At
the same time they were sitting in various political offices and economic

This advice to journalists might also be helpful to
A Yugoslav Journalist's Advice to U.S. Media Jasmina Teodosijevic-Ryan, TomPaine.com
November 7, 2001
How and when does journalism become propaganda? As a
writer, broadcaster and media analyst from the former
Yugoslavia, I have observed the process first-hand. It
starts slowly, then spreads like a stain. The transformation from objective journalism to
propaganda begins with the addition of adjectives when
referring to the other side. The "enemy" becomes
"merciless" or "hate-filled". Then comes the shaping,
cutting and editing reports to benefit one side. "Our"
victims have names, faces and grieving families; they
must be avenged. "Theirs" do not exist. When
journalists say "we" to refer to "their" side's
military force, they've crossed the decisive bright
line into nonprofessional territory. I analyzed both Serbian and Kosovo Albanian media for
the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting
during the months of high violence in Kosovo in
1998-1999. Most striking was the similarity of
language and models that the biased media of both
sides were using to demonize and dehumanize the
"others." "Murderers", "death squads", "terrorists"
and "zlocinci" (evildoers) were always on the other
side. One of those media was Radio-Television of Serbia,
which strongly supported the policy of former
president Milosevic, and helped him remain in power by
falsifying the news and manipulating public opinion.
Their studios were bombed during the NATO air-strikes
on Yugoslavia in 1999, and 16 young staffers died
there. International organizations protested NATO's
hitting this seemingly-civilian target. NATO's
officials responded that Radio-Television of Serbia
were a part of Milosevic's war propaganda machine, and
as thus, a legitimate military target. One wonders how
would NATO have reacted if Milosevic had the power to
rocket Fox News or CNN. We usually connect propaganda to totalitarian regimes
and undemocratic societies. But recently, when major
American broadcast networks decided to edit bin
Laden's statements in response to a government
request, I saw U.S. media abandoning the main
principles of journalism. Until then, I had explained
away the unprofessional mistakes I'd observed as
understandable outbursts of emotion in the aftermath
of September 11th. But then I read CBS president
Andrew Heyward's explanation about the decision to
censor bin Laden: "Given the historic events we are
enmeshed in, it's appropriate to explore new ways of
fulfilling our responsibilities to the public." Farewell to the media responsibility to fully and
impartially inform the public! Who really believes
that the government instruction to reduce coverage of
bin Laden was for the public benefit? I think the
government's main concern was not that bin Laden might
send "secret messages" through U.S. television, but
that his arguments were more complex that the
caricature they wished to sell to the public. In times of turbulence and war, when passions and
emotions prevail over reason, journalists are
pressured from all sides, even by their own emotions.
Slowly and imperceptibly, they can slide from
professionalism into political marketing. Aware of
that, I developed a set of simple reminders for
myself, that might be useful to other colleagues when
navigating in these choppy waters. -Always remain a third party. No war is "your" war. - Resist free advice from the government. Preserve
your skepticism. -Treat the victims on all sides with respect. All
human beings have faces and families. No one should be
dehumanized as "collateral damage." -And, finally, in whatever ways you can manage to,
observe propagandist media on the other side. Do you
look like them? Have you become a soldier of your own
propagandist army? It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them. -- Alfred Adler

@_subject: States Rights & National ID's 
It has been posited that the fed's would allow the states to form a
compact with respect to sharing data between states, basically because the
Republicans believe in states rights.
This doesn't hold water.
When one speaks of 'states rights' it references the ability of the state
to act autonamously and decide their own policies INTERNALLY; not to act
as a parallel federal agency. This is clearly not an internal issue. Further, a considerable percentage of Congress and the President have come
out (lukewarmly) against the idea.
When coupled with the growing concern over the abandonment by the
executive of current legal process (eg military trials for civilian
crimes) and the fact that Congress has not declared war the
Executive/Congress will find it harder in coming days to see 'eye to eye'.
This will make it even harder for an agreement to be reached.
 Personal prediction: Ashcroft will be history within 12-24 months. He
 will either step down because of a 'or else' situation or he will be
 found in contempt of Congress for refusing to provide the requested
 information and justification. The Executive is NOT the primary authority
 at the federal level, the Congress is. The Executive seems to have
 forgotten that.
 It would not surprise me if within 5-10 years we don't see a new
 Amendment better defining these relationships.
 Last nite on PBS there was a show where a congressman and an executive
 representative discussed the current situation. The congressman actually
 quoted the 6th. The reaction of the executive rep was stone faced silent
 anger. The congressman basically ripped him a new butthole. I only got
 to see about 10 minutes of it and I don't know the shows name.

@_subject: The times, they are a changin'...and so is SSZ...Open Forge? 
Just a heads up on some basic changes that will significantly effect each
and every one of you. We are undergoing a fundamental change in direction
and goals. We are going to start a Linux/Plan 9 based source forge which
includes hardware as well as software. The tools will be Open Source. We
will offer closed source licenses as well. We will continue the on-site
service, still 24*365 (at varying rates), and development services. A
fundamental change will be the majority of SSZ services will move to
open-forge.org or open-forge.com. We're also adding visual graphics arts,
focused on web pages and limited length animations. Club Inferno, The CDR,
& Austin Cypherpunks will not move from ssz.com however. Our other mailing
lists will move to open-forge.org in early Jan. 2002.
The network will be more complex than my current single site. It will
consist of three (3) seperate physical sites (N. Austin, C. Austin,
Elgin). The N. Austin site will host a T-1. This will be fed by ISDN to
the current SSZ site (about 10 miles away). Elgin (about 30 miles away) will consist of a ISDN link to the T-1 site as well. There is a potential
for a site in Leander (about 20 miles) sometime next year - no promises.
We will build a Plan 9 based network for Hangar 18 that will be available
for public use.
This means that sometime in mid-Dec. of this year we'll be moving to a
T-1. There may be a few of days of flaky service and then we should have
it worked out. We apologize for any problems or inconveniences this may
cause. We won't drop the current ISDN link until the T-1 is working so we should at most have a day or two of downtime (hopefully I can do the
swap in a couple of hours).
These sites will offer 802.11a/b wireless acess as well as 56k dial-in
services. The dial-in services will not be offered to the clients or
Hangar 18 (we're not a ISP, sorry). The wireless resources will be
accessed through accounts setup under Hangar 18. We currently have a
single AP up on N. 183 behind Target (irrelevant to non-Austinites) but it
is not set for outside access at this time.
More to come, I promise...

fact, over the next couple of years you'll see the recognition of computer
code in all forms recognized as 'speech'. You will also find that the IP
problems we're currently facing will be found to be unworkable and a more
liberal mechanism will be instituted. In parallel with this will be the
growth of both wireless and private networks that will further complicate
attempts by any party to snoop without permission (crypto will be a major

QUANTUM ACOUSTICS.   The flatland world of electrons
[SSZ: Text deleted]
SINGING LIKE A CANARY requires little thought, but simple
actions, to yield complex vocal physics, researchers have found,
yielding potential insights into how humans generate speech
sounds.  Human speech and the songs of many bird species share a
central similarity: the skills are not present at birth, but are only
learned through early-life experiences.  To determine how brain
activity leads to the production of sound, scientists strive to
understand how much of the sound comes from complicated
instructions from the brain and how much comes from complex
physics of vocal organs.  Now, a US-Argentina research
collaboration (Gabriel Mindlin, University of Buenos Aires,
Gabriel has designed a simple physical model
that accurately reproduces notes of a canary song.  The researchers
modeled the canary's vocal organ, called the syrinx.  According to
previous experimental evidence, the syrinx generates sound
through vibrations of its labial "folds"---flaps of tissue which open
and close the air passage between the throat and the lungs.  In their
model, the researchers make the key assumption that these labial
folds behave like a simple spring, moving back and forth to change
the size of the air passage.  They further assume that a canary
controls its vocalizations through two actions: changing the
pressure of the air from the lungs and using muscles to modify the
stiffness of the folds. By varying these two parameters, the
researchers found that the spring-like labia could produce faithful
recreations of three canary notes.  Therefore, simple changes to a
basic system, rather than sophisticated instructions from the brain,
can reproduce the rich, complex vocal physics which give rise to
complicated sounds. (Gardner et al., Physical Review Letters, 12

One can define the 'price' and how it gets there from two perspectives.
The first is the seller, the second in the buyer. The sellers position as
to why they accepted a particular prices is actually much easier to
analyze then the purchasers rationale (the reason is there are
non-economic issues involved).

HIDDEN OBJECTS REVEALED WITH QUANTUM
HOLOGRAPHY. Second sight and remote viewing are terms used
to explain charlatans' supposed psychic ability to see hidden
objects in terms of pseudoscientific gibberish. Quantum
holography, on the other hand, is a method firmly grounded in
modern physics that permits the imaging of hidden objects with
entangled photons. Of the quantum entanglement phenomena that
Einstein described as "spooky action at a distance," quantum
holography may be the spookiest to date.  Researchers at Boston
University's Quantum Imaging Laboratory (Bahaa Saleh,
617-353-7176, besaleh propose to create holographic
images of objects concealed in a spherical chamber. Ideally, a
small opening in the chamber wall permits light to enter, but lets
no light out. The photons in a beam of light directed through the
hole scatter from the enclosed object, and ultimately strike the
inner wall of the chamber (see figure at
  According to the scheme, the inside
of chamber would be designed to detect the time when a photon
hits the wall but not where it hits.  Classically, there is no way to
generate an image of an object with this sort of configuration.
Quantum mechanically, however, it's possible to build a hologram
of the hidden object provided that the photons in the illuminating
beam are entangled with photons in another beam.  Each photon in
an entangled pair has properties (such as momentum or
polarization) that are unknown until a measurement is performed
on one photon or the other. When a property of one of the photons
is measured, corresponding information about its entangled mate is
instantly determined. That may seem spooky enough, but in
quantum holography, things get spookier still.  Holograms are
typically constructed with interfering beams of light, which
provides more information about a subject than simple
illumination can. The additional information helps build a three
dimensional image of a three dimensional object.   In quantum
holography, the researchers measure the simultaneous arrivals of
an illuminating photon that is sent into the chamber and a
companion photon in the other entangled beam.  This measurement
tells the researchers about the interference of various possible
paths that the single photon inside the chamber could travel. And
it's the interference of the possible paths that encodes the
holographic image of the hidden object. Very spooky indeed.  For
the moment, quantum holography exists only on paper. But the
researchers assert that there are no technological obstacles to the
proposal, and they hope to begin building an experimental system
soon. (Ayman F. Abouraddy, Bahaa E. A. Saleh, Alexander V.

Hello coder,
I've developed a small mailinglistmanager called ciphermail that works
with gnupg to encrypt and pseudo anonymize all communication between the listmembers and ciphermail.
it's not much code (yet) and it's written in perl with crypt::gnupg and
mime::lite, so it needs a cryptographic filesystem for /tmp because of
the created temporary files created by these modules.
There are a bunch of ideas out there what ciphermail should do in the
next release, so we need some help to implement and improve it ;)
Maybe someone has some spare time to commit a patch or two...
i've set up a webpage under
 with more information
about ciphermail, so maybe you're interessted in.
Hmm. I hope my english is not to bad to get my intention for this mail

Travel Warning
United States Department of State
Bureau of Consular Affairs
Washington, DC  20520
November 6, 2001
The Department of State urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Turkmenistan
at this time.  While the Department of State has authorized the return of
embassy personnel in non-emergency positions and family members of embassy
personnel effective November 6, 2001, the September 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States and the proximity of Turkmenistan to Afghanistan have
raised ongoing concerns for the safety of American citizens in Turkmenistan.
Afghanistan is the site of military operations and continues to harbor
international terrorist Usama bin Laden.  The U.S. Embassy in Ashgabat will
continue to employ heightened security precautions.
All American citizens in Turkmenistan are urged to review their personal
security situations and to take those measures they deem appropriate to
ensure their well-being.  The Government of Turkmenistan has taken steps to
increase security throughout the country.  Nevertheless, the current
situation in the region requires that all Americans in or traveling through
Turkmenistan evaluate carefully the implications for their security and
Americans who decide to remain in or visit Turkmenistan should exercise
caution and take all appropriate measures to ensure their personal safety
and monitor the local news.
U.S. citizens in Turkmenistan are strongly urged to register and obtain
updated security information at the American Embassy in Ashgabat.  The U.S.
Embassy is located at 9 Pushkin Street, off
Maqtymquly Street.  The telephone number is 993-12-35-00-45, fax number
For further general information regardinq travel to Turkmenistan, U.S.
citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet
on Turkmenistan, available via the Internet at This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning of September 19, 2001 and
alerts Americans to ongoing security concerns in Turkmenistan and to the
discontinuation of the authorized (voluntary) departure status of
non-emergency personnel and family members of U.S. Embassy personnel.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 563  October 30, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein, and
James Riordon
WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE? This may seem to be more of a question
for psychologists than physicists. But two researchers (Joseph
Wakeling, jwakeling now at the University of
Fribourg, Switzerland, and Per Bak, Imperial College, 011-44-20-
7594-8528, p.bak argue that intelligence is not an abstract
concept, but must be considered as a physical phenomenon. Any
definition of intelligence, they say, cannot ignore a living being's
environment, including its very own body. In their view, an organism
is only intelligent relative to how well it solves the problems that its
surroundings throw at it. This runs counter to many historical ideas,
including the concept that the mind is separate from the body, or that it
is possible to build a desktop computer that thinks like a human
without having the same physical environment or body. To explore the
idea of intelligence, the researchers ran computer simulations of
artificial neural networks called "minibrains." In the simulations, 251
minibrains each attempted to pick the less popular of two choices, 0
and 1, analogous to 251 motorists all trying to pick the less congested
road.  This "Minority Game" would be repeated over many successive
rounds. Each minibrain consisted of three layers of "neurons": "input
neurons," which dictated how many past rounds it could remember,
leading to an intermediary layer, which then led into an "output" layer
that determined what choice was made. If the minibrain ending up
making an incorrect choice, it would reduce the strength of the
connections between neurons supplying the "wrong answer." The
researchers were in for a surprise when they endowed all of the
minibrains with equal abilities, which would be analogous to a bunch
of motorists with the same amount of decision-making skill. In this
situation, no minibrains correctly guessed the minority choice with
even a 50 percent success rate, which is what you'd get by making the
choice with a random flip of a coin. Even an E. coli bacterium, which
searches for glucose by moving in random directions in its
environment, is seemingly more intelligent than this. Only when the
researchers introduced a "rogue" minibrain with more intermediate
neurons to analyze the past rounds did it attain more than a 50 percent
success rate.  Their simulations suggest that intelligence often hinges
on how much one can make use of the data in its physical
environment. (Wakeling and Bak, Physical Review E, November

He was against more than 'planned economies'. Apparently you didn't read
the books as well as you believe, or else you only remember what serves
yoru personal goals. Either way, it's a skewed perspective.
Sticks and stones.
It's interesting that in lambasting me for 'knowing what Hayek would say'
is EXACTLY what you're doing. At least I back my hubris with quotes from
Hayeks works.

No, Hayek wouldn't have. Otherwise he wouldn't have been an apponent of
regulated economies (in particular both socialist and fascist). Why was he
against regulated economies? Because they don't offer the same
opportunities to ALL the members of the market (buyer
and seller alike).
If Hayek were alive today and you asked him,
"Do you support a business in a free market refusing to sell to Jews?"
His answer would have been decidedly in the negative. Hayek supported
'free choice' for both buyer and seller. Applying a condition of sale to
only a segment of the market, as opposed to the whole market (ie "No
shirt, no shoes, no sale" versus "No shirt, no shoes, and your ugly, no
sale") violates all three of the standards necessary for a free market.
Hayek understood something you don't, a business is a public trust. It is
not a pure expression of individual freedom. Why? Because it involves more
than one party.
One has the right to do as you want, UNTIL it effects another. Then they
have a say.
A business market with only one party is no market.

Yes, there is.
The panel antennas I've seen actually used (they are used in motels and
such to 'beam' the sensitivity down the central hall) are lucky if they'll
hit the other end of a football field.
Yagi's might make it to 3-5 miles, no more.
Yep, and illegal as hell if you hook them to a 802.11 anything.

ONLY with a high gain parabolic. Not with a omni. Further, all it takes to
find the other dish is look down that line of site.
They're cheap cards, less than $100 each. The 802.11a, which are higher
frequency, higher bandwidth came out last month. The AP's are supposed to
hit the street on or right after the 15'th of this month.
I'm going with 802.11a myself. The 'b' stuff seems a tad to kid toyish to

Not with 802.11 anything will it be 'clear across town'. A few hundred
yards w/ 802.11b and maybe a mile with 802.11a. Now if you're talking
directional then it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to ask "Where does
that nifty parabolic point? Why, at that other nifty parabolic. Well,
gentlemen, how's 'bout we take 'em both down?"
If you want distance you'll either have to add an illegal final or else
use packet or some other mechanism (probably illegaly as well).

Of course people want to take advantage of others. This realization is
what is behind the CACL objection to 'government' (which after all is an
emergent behaviour - ponder that one for a moment and your thrill may fall
away quickly). Their failure is recognizing that the 'government' is
itself an emergent behaviour (albeit an intentional one now - one can't
really speak to how they first came about, it very well could have been
very ant-like with respect to large family groups).
Actually it isn't a well made point at all. To compare programmed
behaviour and biological caste systems to a bunch of humans with
self-referential views is the worst case of begging the question. He's
certainly made a hypothesis, no evidence has been forthcoming for it and
there is a very large body that would argue against it.
In addition, emergent behavior may or may not actually help the individual
components of the population. Remember the concept of 'evolution'. To get
the ants and bees we have now required a bunch of ants and bees which
didn't survive because their programming didn't work. It's also worth
noting that the understanding we have of emergent systems are for
reletively simple systems. Something that can't be said about any group of
humans irrespective of size. This 'evolution' argument could actually be
used against CACL theories because governments didn't always exist, at
some point they emerged.
Sunders comparison is fundamentaly flawed, the only thing he hit on the
head was himself.
Altruistism is cloaked self-interest. The only reason one helps another is
because at some level it helps themselves (you can talk about % of genes

Hypocrite. In 'making your own decision' you in effect remove any moral or
ehtical framework from your decision. In fact you are acting upon
'freedom for me, but not for thee'. Why? Because you have set yourself up
as the decider of another fate. Your feelings about letting others make
those sorts of decisions for you are clear.
Or do you hold that 'self-defence' applies only to libertarians?
No, the only solution in Faustines 'survival situation' is to create a
neutral 3rd party that is responsible to all participants. It is not
ethical, or workable, to allow each and all to go their own way.

Everything is a 'survival situation', some are just easier to resolve than
others. False distinction on your part.
Everybody with half an interest in surviving the 'survival situation' most
certainly cares about 'human society'. They have a primary goal.
AVOID DOG-EAT-DOG.
However, CACL doesn't provide a process to do that. When faced with a
crisis situation it jumps right to the 'worst case' result.
The reality is that 'survival situations' are why peoople build societies.
It happens to be why ALL social animals adopted that strategy, by sharing
and cooperating it becomes possible to maximize the number of survivers.
Something that CACL philosophy couldn't care sot about.
The reality is that by refusing to force others to share you in fact
exacerbate your survival situation. You claim that if somebody forces you
it is wrong, yet you seem to believe it's ok to force others.
So much for doing away with 'coercion'. At most CACL philosophy buys a
level or two of indirection with regard to blaim. However, that doesn't
remove the responsibility (re my Hayek quote on that topic a few weeks
CACL, as you clearly demonstrate by your responce, is focused on the 'I'.
Perfect example of why you tend toward CACL philosophy.
And by the way, with no 'human society crap' there isn't any such thing as
'stealing'. There is 'taking' and 'taking against anothers wishes' but
neither of these are 'stealing'.
But you just did with your previous example. It's a perfect example of the
CACL 'Freedom for me, but not for thee'.

You're going to learn something else. Once squirrels grow up they don't
look to 'other' squirrels for behaviour. It's already set.
Squirrels can't learn to solve problems by watching other squirrels.
Outside of birds and people, there aren't a lot of animals outside of
primates and cetacians that do learn by observation (and this can be, and
has been, proven by observation).
At most a given squirrel is doing a correlation analysis on whether they
(and I challenge you to demonstrate a squirrel has an 'I', which is
necessary before they can have a 'they') see a problem or not. After
enough false alarms the squirrel HABITUATES and ceases to respond to that
call FOR A SHORT TIME PERIOD. You can also find may studies on this
involving Meerkats and Chimps (there are lots of studies of chimps - three
calls - snake, cheetah, bird).

If you use the work 'reputation' to mean that the past behaviour is a
reasonable indicator of future behavior (as most CACL use it) then it is
most certainly a shared hallucination.
In fact it's not even 'economic', it's 'emotional' in nature.

Actually it isn't 'across the board', there is a bail out clause.
No particular one, let's just say that 20 years ago when I was a lot
younger and sillier I did some extensive social experimentation.
And no bitterness at all; just clear rational observation (it's also based
on the biology but that's a seperate and less fun issue).

     No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any

     absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection Laws: and the
     net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on
     Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the

Fact is, this is revisionist crap.
They closed the original list. Members (none of the original founders
including Timmy) decided that this was not acceptable so they fixed the
problem of having any one person in charge of the list. In the process the
new lists decided to broaden the topics to crypto, civil liberties, and
economics since these topics have always been hot on the list.
Rich, motivated guy like yourself could start their own Cypherpunks list
with no hassle and minimum cost. It's interesting that you bitch about
what other people do with their list but you don't have the gumption to do
anything about it (just like when the original list you helped found
floundered because of incompetent handling).

Looking at  it appears they provide anonymous
encrypted services including email, instant messaging (chat), and server
based file storage. Their client code is open source Java. They appear
to use standard algorithms. They are based in Canada. The services are
free at small volumes (supposedly suitable for ordinary personal use)
and for fee at higher volumes.
I only know what I see on their website. Has anyone else heard of these

@_subject: What is a 'right'? 
A 'right' is an activity that any individual could engage in (at least in
principle) while 'in a state of nature'.
So what does 'in a state of nature' imply? It implies human activity a
priori to the concept of 'civilization'.
What are the limits of such activities? Isolation, sharing, and force.
The concept of 'force' is required because not all individuals want to
Isolation allows an individual to engage in any desired activity for the
simple reason there is no potential interference.
Sharing, such as in a family group, such that resources are distributed
but at the same time have more persons active in its 'management' (I draw
a distinction here becuase of such things as Clovis Point behaviour).
And finaly, force. The ability of one individual to significantly impact
anothers physical being directly.
Why do people institute 'civilization'? Because we can't live in
isolation. There are groups greater than families. And finaly, because not
all individuals will use force in the same manner.
The concept of 'right' is intimate and irremovable from the concept of
'coercion through physical force'. Why? Because one can't have a 'right'
unless one also has the ability to use force to defend it.
What does it take to use 'force'? Existance and motivation/desire,
irrespective of whether we talk of 'a state of nature' or 'civilization'.
One can not remove the concept of 'right' from 'force'. They are not
seperate concepts or entities (similar to momentum).
The only way to mitigate the use of 'force' is to mitigate 'desire'.
The only way to mitigate 'desire' is to use 'force' (or at least make it
clear that if a behaviour is engaged in force will ensue).
To do this we institute a (hopefully) common system whereby the inter play
between 'force' and 'desire' are hopefully balanced.
Note that there is nothing in nature which implies that force and desire
will be mitigated in and of themselves (so much for CACL philosophy). In
fact, if one looks at game theory it becomes abundently clear, even given
the utility of game theoretic concepts, that the best strategy is not to
play by the rules given a choice (this helps explain why non-sentient
biological activity conforms to game theory in many cases).
This of course destroys any concept of 'utopia' where everyone plays by
the same rules all the time without exception.

Arguments over 'property' are irrelevant. The issue is 'respect',
'polylateral representation', and 'universal accountability'.
Dogs (and most other 'higher' animals) have an understanding of 'property'
and 'self defence' deeper than most people do (especialy sunder and most other CACL's). If you don't believe it then try to take their dog bone

Sorry about the long mail list.
I would like to request you to contact your State Representative,
Senators and the Federal Communication Commission Officers about a
issue that is causing ALL UNIX/Linux and Apple users a problem.  It
seems that the FCC has chosen to exclude all NON Microshaft NT/95
users from being able to use their Internet Universal Licensing System
which they have requested FCC Licenses holder to use for license
renewals.  The problem is that it requires a JavaScript Plug-in that is a
Microsoft product only.
Simply go to " and then select "ONLINE
FILING".  I believe this to be the complete path to the failure.  Which is "This plug-in only runs on Windows NT/95".
We need to protect the finest operating system from being excluded
from the United States by our Government Officials.

thank you for the kind consideration of our work.
How many images are posted to Usenet every day? I'd say around 50,000
a day, including GIF images and other image file types that we did not
look at [1].
Which USENET archive that stores a full feed from the time before
steganography suddenly hit the limelight of the press would you use?
We had access to a couple of Terra bytes accounting for a few months
of Usenet activity.  Thats what we looked at.
You might have heard that Usenet traffic is mostly for binary data.
That is correct but most of the binary traffic is not in images [2].
If you have any suggestions on how to increase the scope of our
analysis, I would be glad to hear them.  Alternatively, you might
conduct a study yourself as I just released most of my tools.  It
would be interesting to see something more "statistically significant" ;)

Censorship is not strictly limited to government...
Censor -
Official who examines anything to be read, heard, or viewed, in order to
suppress some objectionable feature on moral, political, or military
Note it does NOT require government membership to be an official.
Everybody self-sensors, all day, every day. Nothing wrong with it since

Digital Bearer Settlement List , dcsb
  Daily Briefing  November 26, 2001
Cybersecurity chief pushes early-warning system
By Bara Vaida, National Journal's Technology Daily
The top priorities for the White House Office of Cyberspace Security
include the creation of both an early-warning network for cyberattacks and
an analysis center that would help the government target the most
vulnerable points in the nation's critical infrastructure, the office's
chief said last week in an interview with National Journal's Technology
Richard Clarke, special adviser on cyberspace security to President Bush,
said the early-warning network, called the Cyber Warning and Information
Network (CWIN), would at first be a voice system that would link major
computer-network operation centers and the information-sharing and
assurance centers (ISACs) that represent critical infrastructure sectors,
such as financial services, telecommunications and transportation.
CWIN would be modeled after the existing National Operations and
Intelligence Watch Offices Network, which connects senior officials at the
Pentagon, the National Security Agency, the White House, the State
Department and the CIA by phone within 15 seconds.
"Let's say someone [in the private sector] sees 'Nimda' [a computer virus]
spiking," Clarke said in describing how CWIN would work. "They can pick up
the phone and get most of the people that need to know right away.
"This is a case where the government doesn't know best or first," he added.
"So you need a public-private partnership to reach out to these nodes in
the private sector ...that see viruses first, that see the tsunamis of
denial-of-service attacks first."
Clarke also is working on building the National Infrastructure Simulation
and Analysis Center authorized under the section 1016 of the anti-terrorism
law that Bush signed into law last month. The center was authorized to
receive $20 million through the Defense Department and would create a
simulated model of the Internet, the nation's telecom system and its
physical infrastructure. The goal is to enhance understanding of how the
systems interact and to mitigate vulnerabilities.
"There really is no place today where there is a live model of the
Internet, and we want to model the interactions and interdependencies
between the Internet, the telephone networks, the electric power grid,"
Clarke said. "The way I describe it is [that] we need an 'acupuncture map'
of the U.S. You know, where are the pressure points?"
Developing a model also may help Clarke to articulate his message that
private-sector companies need to analyze their computer-security
"The lesson I'm trying to get out to people ... is that we need to
understand what the worst-case scenario is and then do prudent risk
management so that you mitigate those possibilities," he said.
In addition, Clarke said Bush supports legislation by Sen. Robert Bennett,
R-Utah, that would exempt businesses from the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) when they share computer-security information with the government.
Clarke said he has talked to lawmakers on the issue.
On encryption, Clarke said he has no plans to change current U.S. policy,
though some people on the Hill wanted to reopen the issue after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.

Bullshit, you're playing word games. Get your dictionary and educate
yourself on this point. You're using the word in the fist case to mean
select individuals as sub-optimal. Then when you're called to the carpet
on your logical inconsistency you all of a sudden change your word usage
to mean 'select', which ain't the same thing at all in the context of your
original usage. Discriminate as you use above is almost exclusively a
technical application, which isn't applicable to the social application
we're actually discussing. Why? Because in your first usage you were
applying a measure of 'merit' whereas in the above usage you are drawing a
simple distinction. Not the same beasty at all - Choate Prime or not.
1. To observe or mark the difference between
2. To show partiality because of race, nationality, or class prejudice
You really should be more consistent in the way you use words.

Actually 'merit' isn't. Merit is measured in a meritocracy by the efficacy
of the solution. That's a TECHNICAL measure, not emotional or social.
Discrimination is inherently ILLOGICAL (ie emotional), which puts it in
direct odds with the concept of 'merit'.
Further, a meritocracy makes judgements about worth based on the solution
not the source. Source filtering is inherent in discrimination, hence they
can't be synonymous or layered.
Doh indeed.

Trying to pitch AP as if only certain classes of people are at risk is

Your assertions of 'how it will be' and 'how it should be' are no more

at what actually happened).
No, the current bitching over crypto and IP will be resolved in the next

That's where 'press' comes into play. The 1st provides two protections.
The first is to have an opinion and to express it, 'speech'. The second is
'press' which guarantees the right to share with other humans. Speech that
is not shared, after all, is no better than speech not uttered. Now this
explicitly protects the hardware and 'non-human' mechanisms that humans
use to distribute their speech. The courts will eventually find that the
sharing of speech, irrespective of mechanism, is protected. To deny an
individual a mechanism to share their speech is in fact a violation of
their speech. In addition the first does NOT draw ANY distinctions about
what sorts of speech are or are not protected, it simply says 'speech' is  --

Hate to break it to you but Freud <> Psychology.
I still havent read that part of AP Jim appeals to nothing more than his own vanity.
What the fundamental flaw is to expect individuals to use AP to protect
themselves while at the same time expecting those attacked through AP to
do nothing other than lay down and take it.
If fundamentaly mis-understands that two wrongs don't make a right (even
if one is done in self-defence) and that when you attack a person their
reaction is to act in self defence.
It's just another example of the CACL failure with respect to the human

Actually this isn't the 'only' way. ALL (!!!) that is required to keep the
security of the email traffic is that it is source encrypted for the
destination; it's gibberish to all middle-men. What the remailer chain
does is break the causal connectivity, it provides plausible deniability.
Now, with respect to middle man routing, if each middle man routes to
another layer randomly then it addresses the exact issues of a 'turned'
remailer. In addition, with the current 'ad hoc' key management mechanism
getting intermediate keys isn't that hard (just pose as a remailer
operator and they'll gush into your keyring). A solution to this problem,
that you won't accept but 'oh well', is to create the network using 'small
world' approaches so that the remailers have a 'back channel' to
continously validate the 'reputation' of the next stage remailers (ie ala 'igor') while at the same time not even knowing what other remailers out
there might exist in the 'remailer cloud' (and more importantly not
This approach has a couple of additional advantage; it doesn't require the
user to understand some hard to comprehend syntax for the remailers, and
it doesn't require the user to keep all this evidence around a priori to
their actual use of the remailer chain (ie they don't have to d/l a key
from anywhere mecessarily) - traffic analysis.
At no point can anyone other than the recipient 'read the message', unless
it was sent in the 'clear' in the first place (silly thing to do).
ROTFLMAO. ONLY(!!!) if the source didn't destination encrypt to begin
with. A critical step you seem to not quite 'get'.

Plan 9 OS:
Hangar 18 Distributed Computing Co-Op:
A Plan 9 based tool we hope to have available this summer;
A remailer for Plan 9
One of the primary values of the Internet is email. It provides a reliable
and consistent link across time and space. It is the proto-typical killer
app. However, to use email effectively there should be two additional
features. We don't promise more don't exist. The first feature is the
ability to reflect or remail a single email to many recipients. The second
is to strip identifying header information from the sender prior to the
subscriber getting it.
igor does not use 'embedded routing commands' like many other anonymous
remailer packages. We believe that tampering or altering the body of the
email is simply wrong. We offer two way to input data into igor. The first
is through Subject: line escaped commands and the second is through
additional header files. An example of each is,
X-igor: some_commands
This allows the first remailer to strip the command data out and then
process the email as if igor had never been involved. igor supports limited
routing selection, which is intended to make traffic analysis harder. igor
sends individual emails embedded in igor-specific header info to eliminate
as much interaction with the email itself. All inter-igor traffic is
encrypted with PK's managed by the Evil Geniuses.
Route Commands (ie igor: * * ...):
strip			Strip the From: header
zombie			Strip the From: header and replace with
route#			Route the message through # other igor nodes,
cover			Provide cover traffic for each outbound email by
subscribe $		Subscribe to mailing list $
who $			Who is subscribed to list $?
info $			Provide info on list $
help			Request an info-help file
igor Configuration Parameters (igor.conf):
MyPubKey		This remailers public key, non-traffic related
MyOwnKey		This remailers private key, non-traffic related
MyPubRing		My public key ring, this contains a mapping of each
MyOwnRing		My private key ring, this contains a mapping of each

[EDITOR'S NOTE:  In honor of the approaching election year, we take this

Vanguard of the Revolution
ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES:  or, How to
Advance Your Beliefs By Helping a Candidate
by Rod D. Martin
© 27 March 2001
    Conservatives forever complain about their political leaders.  But they
don¹t do a lot about it.
    Liberals (or more precisely, Leftists) are quite different.  Coming as
they do mostly from distinct interest groups possessing activist political
cultures and a sense of victimization (be they unionized workers, civil
rights activists, feminists or whomever), leftists grow up on a steady diet
not only of ideas, but of the strategies and tactics necessary to win.  From
cradle to grave, they look to the state as a sort of political savior, and
they learn early how to get from it what they want.
    By contrast, conservatives do not and never have thought in these terms.
Generally, conservatives just want to be left alone, and see government as a
necessary evil, nothing more.  Their lives focus elsewhere:  business,
church, family, civic groups, almost anywhere but politics.  They see
political activity not as a perpetual opportunity to gain advantages, but as
an arena where (every so often) they must defend themselves from the latest
government encroachment.
    This difference in culture is staggering, and accounts for much of the
Left¹s success in the 20th Century.  Conservatives do not think politically;
Liberals do.  And while the Left hones its strategies and tactics year after
year ­ spread across millions of individual people and thousands of
institutions ­ conservatives wake up periodically, notice there¹s an
election, expend a little half-hearted effort, and go back to sleep.
    Because of this relative detachment, conservatives demonstrate a
remarkably persistent naiveté.  Not only do they rarely understand the
system (or what the Left has done and continues to do to them); they also
subscribe year after year to the Sir Galahad theory of politics:  "our ideas
will win because our hearts are pure."  This foolishness costs their
movement not only elections but innumerable volunteers (and donors) every
year, good men and women who cannot understand why their sheer rightness has
not persuaded and conquered all.  Meanwhile, the Left marches on.
    The hard truth is, however wonderful our ideas may be, it is not those
ideas but the actions they inspire which have consequences in the real
world.1   And all those whiney conservatives, waiting for Trent Lott (or
whomever) to effortlessly give them their hearts¹ desires, are getting
exactly what they deserve.  The concept is as old as the Bible:  those who
do not work, shall not eat.
INFLUENCE AND POWER
    At times almost despite themselves, conservatives over the past
generation have come to hold tremendous influence.  They have also held some
power.  The confusion of these concepts has lead to much needless
    In Morton Blackwell¹s words, "Power means you can make things happen.
Influence means that those with power will return your telephone calls and
seriously consider what you suggest. Only those with power govern."
    The aim of any political movement is power, power for the purpose of
implementing the movement¹s beliefs.  All the influence in the world will
not replace this power.  In the 1990s, many conservatives became highly
disillusioned with their leaders, who seemed to constantly compromise.  They
failed to understand that though Republicans held the Congress,
conservatives were still a minority.  They had gained tremendous influence,
but only a share of the power.  Having a seat at the table, they could
dicker, but they could not dictate.  They needed numbers.
    There¹s only one way they will ever get those numbers:  they must elect
more conservatives.  Not Republicans; conservatives.  This is no slap at the
Republican Party:  it is simply a recognition that the two ideas are not
synonymous, however much overlap there may be, and that if conservatives
want that to change, they¹ll have to work for that too.  Furthermore, it¹s a
statement that the party primary often matters a great deal; and that ­ as
the Left has always known ­ the political cycle is year-round, every year.
In that never-ending fight, it is the candidates who go out to do battle,
who bleed and sweat and die for your beliefs.  And at the end of the day,
they ­ and only they ­ will have a chance to make and execute the laws.
    Most people will never be candidates.  At most they will only have
influence (which is certainly not to be despised), and many won¹t even have
that.  But they can give their ideas power ­ and exercise a measure of power
themselves ­ by working hard for a candidate who shares their views.  In
fact, there is absolutely no more effective way than this by which the
average person may bring about meaningful political change.
SO WHAT CAN I DO?
    The question for many, therefore, becomes:  "So what can I do?  And what
could I possibly offer."  The answer is, "Quite a lot!"  For all the talk of
big money in politics, the truth is that most campaigns are run on
shoestrings, with the lion¹s share of what cash there might be going to
television ads at the very end, leaving all the real work to be done on
almost nothing.  Nowhere is this more true than in a challenger race, where
a (usually semi-unknown) candidate tries to make headway against everything
the other party can throw at him, and often everything his own party can
throw at him too (this is not a criticism:  parties shouldn¹t just give away
their nomination, after all).  This is usually your candidate (we¹re trying
to gain seats, after all):  tired, broke and pummeled from all sides.
    Yes, there¹s quite a lot you can do for this candidate.  Even a handful
of truly faithful people could change his world, and the outcome of the
    Speaking as a former (and future) candidate for the U.S. House, I submit
the following items you can and should do for the standard-bearer of your
choice.  The list is not exhaustive, but it will keep you both busy and
1.  PICK A CANDIDATE.  With all due respect to those wonderful men and women
who yearly work in support of every candidate in sight, there remains great
wisdom in Christ¹s words that no one can serve two masters.  The average
volunteer has neither time nor mental energy for more than one race, at
least not beyond a superficial level.  Hence, if you don¹t pick one
candidate on whom to focus, you will do a bad job for everyone, and advance
the cause very little.
    Picking a candidate is a matter of taste:  who excites you, who believes
most like you, who is running for an office you care about, who is running
against someone you really want defeated.  The issue is not whether you
throw yourself wholeheartedly into a campaign for Congress or for Justice of
the Peace; rather, the issue is whether you pick one and follow through.
    Finally, make your choice early and stick like glue.  The early phases
of a campaign are generally its most tenuous, with limited support, little
or no money, and the most overwhelming task of all:  getting noticed and
breaking out of the pack.  Likewise, later on, the campaign will certainly
face any number of challenges, from run-away success (which often leads to
complacency and defeat) to persistently low polling numbers (which are often
misleading, but run away crucial support) to crippling allegations (which
may or may not be true) to internal incompetence or strife among the
volunteers or staff.  Murphy¹s Law was specifically written for political
campaigns, and you need to be there through thick and thin, working like
everything depended on you.  When the smoke clears, and hordes of others
have fallen away, it may just turn out that everything did.
2.  PICK THE RIGHT CANDIDATE.  Since you¹re going to be working so hard and
so long for this person, you really need to pick well from the start.
Again, this is a matter of taste; and yet most conservatives have very
specific ideological views they want their candidates to share, and insofar
as possible this should be determined up front.
    This is not to say that the candidate owes you limitless time; neither
is it to say that you have a right to treat him rudely or "examine" him like
a professor.  But if he¹s written extensively (and some candidates have),
read what he¹s written.  Call him on the phone or email him:  some
candidates respond very well to this.  If he¹s reasonably accessible, feel
free to ask him to dinner (and buy his dinner:  he¹s broke.  He¹s giving up
all his time, income and personal savings to work around the clock for you).
Don¹t get offended if he¹s not available, either (and expect to be passed to
a scheduler):  he has a family, possibly a job, and literally thousands if
not millions of other people also seeking his time.  If worse comes to
worst, you can usually speak with him at or after political meetings or
    But somehow, get to know him, not necessarily like you know your best
friend, but well enough to determine whether you think he¹s a good guy,
whether you trust him, and whether you want to see him win.  When the chips
are down, these feelings and impressions may make the difference between
victory and defeat.
3.  CUT HIM SOME SLACK.  Once you¹ve picked him, remember that the candidate
is human, just like you.  You make mistakes, you sometimes fail to think
before you speak, you don¹t always know everything about everything, and
every now and then you do something really wrong.  So does your candidate.
Take it for granted.
    Now admittedly, if the candidate turns out to be an axe-murderer, you
might want to re-think your support.  But short of that, it¹s important to
be very realistic:  just as when you married, you picked this guy for better
or worse, and you know on the front end he¹s going to have unseen warts.
Bailing at the first sign of trouble ­ or at the first policy disagreement ­
is not only bad form, it¹s cowardly.  And if you¹re looking for a candidate
who perfectly reflects your own views, go run yourself.
    Now of course, you may certainly seek to educate your candidate:  maybe
he just doesn¹t understand, or hasn¹t ever thought about what you believe,
or is getting bad advice.  Look for an opportunity to politely, concisely
and effectively present your side.  But don¹t take it personally if you fail
to convince him:  you may well do so later, and even if you don¹t, if you
picked him in the first place, chances are that disagreements on one or two
issues are nothing compared to all the things about which you agree.
    4.  GIVE MONEY, EVEN IF IT¹S ONLY A LITTLE.  No matter what you can or
cannot give, this matters, more than you know.  And the earlier you give,
the more it matters.
    Everyone knows that campaigns run on money; what they don¹t always grasp
is that a successful candidate must spend at least half his time just
raising that cash.  Challengers have a special problem, in that the people
who can most help them judge their viability by how much they raise early,
and from how many different donors they raise it.  Your $25 check is a vital
part of building the support your candidate needs from so-called "major
donors", from the party committees in Washington, from potential endorsers,
and from the media.  It will also buy about 167 desperately-needed bulk-rate
    Obviously, it is essential that you give as much as you can.  Far fewer
people are giving than you think, and your candidate is spending enormous
time (and money) reaching them.  Your early help will make his work easier,
more effective, and more concentrated on actual campaigning.  Oh, and one
other thing:  if a candidate tells you he¹s in a financial crisis, don¹t
just assume it¹s a sales pitch.  It¹s almost always true.
5.  LET THE CAMPAIGN KNOW YOU¹RE AVAILABLE, AND FIND OUT WHAT IT NEEDS.  As
important as money is, nothing you can give is so valuable as your time; and
the campaign could never pay enough people to replace its better volunteers.
Be one.
    How do you do this?  Call the campaign and let them know you want to
help.  Below I will give some specific ideas which you should offer (the
campaign does not always know what it needs, since it¹s almost always
understaffed and under-funded); however, you should also make yourself
generally available, and be open to the specific requests the campaign may
    Who do I mean when I say "the campaign"?  There¹s no one answer.  It
could be a campaign manager, a volunteer coordinator, a scheduler, the
candidate himself, or any number of other people.  And it may well shift
from week to week.
    Don¹t let this daunt you.  Just go with the flow, and be patient.  If
you¹ve offered yourself and the campaign hasn¹t gotten back with you,
politely offer again, and again:  chances are, you¹ve gotten lost in an
almost impossible shuffle (and if you have time and organization ability,
this may be your cue to volunteer as an office manager).  Don¹t be foolishly
offended by the chaos that characterizes every campaign.  Instead, view it
as an opportunity to make a desperately needed difference.
6.  HOST AN EVENT.  More than anything else, candidates need exposure and
money.  Kill two birds with one stone and host a coffee (or something
    Nothing is as important as these events, whereby you bring your
candidate and your friends together.  The friends will come for your sake;
the candidate will gain credibility with them because of you; and if you
pass the plate, you¹ll raise some money, all for the cost of some Folger¹s.
    Many successful candidates learn to book three to five of these a day,
which should tell you how vital they are, and which should also tell you how
many people are going to have to agree to host them.  Don¹t wait to be
asked:  volunteer early, and often.
7.  MAKE PHONE CALLS.  Phone banks cost a lot of money, but are a
phenomenally effective tool, for polling, fundraising, getting out the vote
and a thousand other things.  You can save the campaign tons of cash by
being a phone volunteer.  It¹s not the most pleasant work you¹ll ever do,
but it can be very rewarding, and is vital to the effort.  Make sure the
campaign provides you a script, and practice it a few times before you start
your calls.
    Separately, you can and should use your phone to help the campaign in a
very obvious and simple way:  talk to your friends about how wonderful your
candidate is, and how proud of him you are.  This sort of casual,
day-in-day-out effort ­ no different from talking about how excited you are
about your favorite team ­ is the stuff of great victories.  When people
start talking like this, a certain "win psychology" develops, and real
momentum builds:  momentum money could never buy.
8.  USE EMAIL EFFECTIVELY.  At least as powerful as personal phone calls,
personal emails to friends are taking a greater and greater role in
campaigns.  Spread the word to your friends, by forwarding campaign emails,
news stories, and your own personal thoughts to your personal address book.
You send all those people lame jokes:  why not the good news about your
candidate (and your worldview)?
    Moreover, it may be that you are specially talented with email or the
web and wish to help in a more formal way.  Most campaigns need quality
people who can create and maintain an online presence, be it a website, an
email list, a chat room, or a prayer team (and just for the record, no one
has used the internet more effectively than Pat Buchanan¹s Linda Muller,
with Jesse Ventura¹s team running a close second).  If you¹d like to help
this way, you¹re needed.
9.  WRITE LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.  Everyone talks about this, but no one does
it.  No one except winning campaigns, that is.
    The truth is, everyone reads the letters to the editor, and much of the
word-of-mouth side of the campaign develops there.  What¹s more, this is
absolutely free media, and being from "regular" people, it is far more
persuasive than a campaign news release (which few ever see anyway).
    A smart campaign will organize a large number of people to regularly
write letters to the editor, and mail them to all the local papers.  Don¹t
wait to be contacted:  call the campaign yourself, preferably the press
secretary.  If possible, write about the message the campaign is focused on
that week.  And if you¹re a good writer, find some of your friends who would
be willing to sign a letter but are afraid to actually write one, and draft
letters for them as well (be sure to collect them and mail them too:  people
promise, but often forget).
10.  STUFF ENVELOPES!  No part of the campaign is so important, especially
in an under-funded race where most or all of the direct mail has to be done
in-house.  At the same time, stuffing and addressing envelopes is some of
the most tedious work you can do, and people hate it.  It¹s not sexy, and
it¹s not fun.  Volunteers tend to flee.  You can not only make an enormous
difference but prove your value and loyalty as well by always being
available for this duty.  You can often save the campaign hundreds or
thousands of dollars through your work, and candidates remember their
envelope stuffers more fondly than anyone else (very important later when
you want to "educate" them on the issues).
11.  HELP WITH THE SIGN EFFORT.  Obviously a crucial part of the campaign¹s
advertising, the need is not so much for you to put up a sign in your own
yard (which of course you should do), but to help put signs up all over your
candidate¹s district.  Ideally, your candidate will want to put a sign in
every available yard, all on the same night.  Anything you can do to find
willing property owners or physically put up signs will make a huge
12.  GET OUT THE VOTE.  Conservative candidates have an alarming tendency to
run winning campaigns, only to lose on election day.  This is because the
Left is extremely effective at getting out their voters, while we generally
are not.  One reason for that effectiveness is that Left-leaning labor
unions teach and encourage get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts.  Conservatives
have no similar resource.
    Talk to the campaign about what you can do.  Hopefully, they will have a
carefully laid out plan, which will probably include early canvassing, an
absentee ballot effort, poll watching, phone banks, and any number of other
things.  Be flexible and pitch in.  If you don¹t, you may throw away a
couple years¹ work.
13.  PRAY FOR AND ENCOURAGE THE CANDIDATE.  As noted at the outset of the
article, conservatives complain a lot, and never more than in a campaign.
But campaigns run on morale, and complaints are among the most
self-destructive things under Heaven.  And it¹s not just the other campaign
workers and volunteers who need a lift:  it¹s the candidate himself.
    The candidate ­ if he¹s worth supporting ­ is killing himself.  You may
at times think he¹s arrogant, and sometimes he may be; but he runs on
adrenaline and supports himself with brave words that rarely resemble his
fears, and from early in the morning till late at night, he has to sell a
million skeptics ­ from CEOs to coffee shop clerks ­ on himself as a person
and his ideas as a program.  He is the ultimate "man in the arena", facing
every manner of outrageous attack and betrayal every day, working himself to
the bone, trying to juggle finances and family and every aspect of this
small industry the product of which is himself, all in pursuit of a goal far
greater than he.  The smallest word of encouragement at the right moment can
be that one thing which allows him to go on.  In point of fact, it often is.
    Likewise, no one needs your prayers more than your candidate and his
family.  The Bible clearly commands prayer for our leaders, but most people
forget to do it.  You mustn¹t.  He needs you.  And more than anything, he
needs the grace of God.
14.  UNDERSTAND THAT WINNING ISN¹T EVERYTHING.  Finally, it¹s well worth
remembering that most candidates lose, and often lose several times, before
they win.  This dispirits lots of volunteers (and even more candidates), but
it shouldn¹t:  it¹s just the way of the world.  The early races are often
learning experiences and opportunities to build an organization and the
candidate¹s name ID.  This is a good thing, no matter how much more fun it
might be to win every time.
    The wise volunteer will work as though victory is just a matter of doing
that one additional thing within his power; but he¹ll also know when to take
his co-workers and his candidate aside, place his hand on their shoulder,
and tell them it¹s all going to be okay, we¹ll get em next time.  That wise
volunteer will also follow through on his words, and stay the course for
round two.  Few decent candidates come out of a well-fought but losing race
weaker; most are in a better position than they¹ve ever been in their life,
if they¹ll learn from their mistakes and move on.  You can be the person who
gives them the strength to do it.  And in so doing, you will advance your
cause concretely, genuinely doing the hard work of freedom.

@_subject: A risk with using MD5 for software package fingerprinting (fwd) 
The cryptographic hash function MD5 is often used to authenticate software packages, particularly in the Unix community. The MD5 hash of the entire package is calculated and its value is transmitted separately. A user who downloads the package computes the hash of the copy received and matches the value against the original.
Putting aside the question of how the the hash value can be safely transmitted separately, there is a potential attack on this method due to the 128 bit length of the MD5 hash output.
If all the individuals having input to the creation of the original software package are trustworthy, then 128 bits would appear to provide adequate security. A man-in-the-middle attacker would have to solve a 128 bit problem to create a Trojan horse infected package that passed the hash verification. That is considered computationally infeasible, at least until the advent of quantum cryptography.
One might think the above argument proves MD5 is sufficient, since if an attacker had an agent working inside the organization that produced the package, the agent could simply insert the Trojan software patch in the original package. However such an insertion is very risky. A sophisticated software company would likely have code reviews that would make introduction of the Trojan code difficult. In an open source model, anyone could detect the insertion. The insertion would then be foiled, the agent would be uncovered and the technical means that the Trojan employed would be compromised.
A safer attack would be for the agent to insert an apparently innocent modification to the package selected so that the MD5 hash of the package with the Trojan code matches the hash of the original package. Since the attacker controls the Trojan code, calculating the value of this modification is subject to the birthday paradox and presents presents a 64-bit problem. Solving such a problem is within the means of a well-funded attacker today.
The modification could be designed to get past code reviews in a number of ways. For example, 64 low order bits in a JPEG icon might be altered. The agent would have to be in a position to make the last modification to the software package prior to release and to send a final pre-release version of the package to the attacker, but those are hardly insurmountable hurdles.  In the open source model, where new releases can be frequent, it may suffice to carry out this attack only occasionally, say to recover private keys.
The obvious solution to this problem is to use a wider hash. For example, SHA-256 would present an group using this attack with a 128-bit problem. Even SHA1 would be preferable, making such an attack an 80  bit problem.  The cost of using a wider hash in this situation is trivial. It would seem the prudent thing to do.

@_subject: Re: [ISN] What Billg's new security effort will cost (fwd) 
cryptography
A serious attempt to address the many security flaws in current systems
will result in major changes to Microsoft software or its culture.
Microsoft has always been a features oriented company.  In the early days,
this orientation served the company well.  Microsoft achieved its early
successes by selling software to the corporate market.  This market is
characterized by a desire to have company wide standard software packages
to minimize support costs, and maximize the ability to transfer information.
When a company was deciding which package is to be anointed the corporate
standard, one of the measures used was a feature comparison chart.  The
chart was used to ensure the chosen package has the features needed by all
the users in the company.  Unfortunately, in general the people who
selected the package did not know which features would be required in
obscure corners of their company.  As a result, they tended to pick the
package with the most features.
Being the "firstest with the mostest" provider established Microsoft
products such as Windows, Word, and Excel in the corporate market.  When
people purchased computers for their homes, they tended to buy what they
knew from work, and these packages then migrated to the home.
Now Microsoft is attempting to make security a new feature of their
software.  However, security is different from all the other features they
have implemented.  It is not about what you can do, which can be
implemented and demonstrated, but about what you can't do, which is usually
the absence of implementation, and ducedly hard to demonstrate.  It is not
about showing there is a path to achieve a result, but about showing that
no such path exists.
One of the things that makes security assurance much harder is having a
complex set of features, which interact to effect the security of the
system.  There are many more possible paths, and much more code where a
flaw can bring the whole system down.
Microsoft can chose to simplify by removing features, which will require a
tidal shift in their culture, or they can make drastic changes in their
implementation strategy in an attempt to maintain their feature set.  My
bet is they try to maintain their feature set.
The first step is to attack the easy problems.  Bruce Schneier and Adam
Shostack, in their paper, "Results, Not Resolution, A guide to judging
Microsoft's security progress" came up with an excellent list of areas to
address first.  Presumably Microsoft will also address the simple coding
problems, like buffer overruns, with improved languages or development
procedures.  Even with these changes, they will still have a system where a
bug in one feature can still break the security of the entire system.
To maintain its feature set, and have a reasonable degree of security,
Microsoft will have to adopt architectures where bugs in most of the
features can not effect security.  These architectures will need much
smaller and more flexible security compartments than systems such as
Windows and Unix provide.  These compartments need to isolate the
privileges given to feature implementations from those given to the users
and those given to other parts of the application system.  This kind of
compartment supports the principle of least privilege, which is the best
path to limit the effect of bugs.

Man, decrease the dossage. You're hallucinating like hell.
I NEVER(!!!!!) EVER(!!!!!) said a damn thing about giving up...
What I DID(!!!!) say was, in different words, was:
That the suggestion that running a simple numerical ecology experiment on
a home computer and then trying to extrapolate that to a real world
application is a complete and utter waste of time. There is no model,
there is no data. This was within the context of (H)ADD (that's me in
spades) being an (mal)adaptive character. Of course it is. If you have to
think more than a few seconds about basic biology to understand that then
go immediately to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200. Every
characteristic of the environment as well as the organism is a
responce to evolutionary forces (re Gaia Theory). Even in the case of
'neutral genetic trait' approaches (which I happen to agree with as well)
it is clear that while a particular character may not be relevant today,
that does not include the past or the future. The fact that (H)ADD are the
thrill seekers means they were probably the ones leading the expansions of mankind in our pre-history. It also probably included those 'psychotics'
who don't have 'feelings for society'. I bet they are one mother of a
Mastadon killer. Probably don't live long but what the hey. As evidence
from not only Homo Sapien but back to Neandertal there is evidence of
helping the injured [1]. I've postulated (half seriously) that this
explains the bloody Aztec and Mayan approaches to civil service. Makes a
lot of sense if you think of them coming from a group of psychopaths in
their distant past :)
Such an extrapolation is also akin to taking the approaches that work with
a 2-body problem in mechanics and then trying to extend them to 3-body or
greater problems (they're insoluble in principle not just fact). It also
has some similarities with graph theory (graphs are a great tool for
demonstrating the connections in an ecological model). There are aspects
of any cliological model that can be considered workable which would have
tremendous impact on other areas (eg cryptography). These signatures
simply aren't there. Signature analysis is your friend.
(H)ADD is an alternate wiring schema for the human brain. It is genetic in
basis. (H)ADD is strongly connected with above average performance,
increased thrill seeking, and unconventional modes of thinking (eg
images & dyslexia). If left to itself one would expect this character to
increase (which it apparently is). The political, educational, and social
views of the status quo find this unsettling. I suggest they change the
way they do school and stop drugging perfectly normal human beings. (H)ADD
is a perfectly normal evolutionary experiment. The 'old' model is being
found wanting by the environment. The current attitudes about (H)ADD are
nothing more than open, socialy supported, bigotry.
With kudos to Rudy Rucker:
There is a better way.
You can do it!

cryptography
Community feature: SILC, a new generation secure chat protocol
Saturday January 26, 09:05 AM EST    [ Open Source ]
- By Pekka Riikonen -
Have you been looking for a secure place to talk? A place where you can be
sure that the message you send to a person really goes to that person, no
one else is able to see the message, and no one is able to alter the
message? More and more people answer yes to the question, but where to find
such a place? The answer comes in the form of new generation chat protocol
called Secure Internet Live Conferencing, or just SILC (casually pronounced
as silk).
Security is the key
Security has been the primary design goal in the development of the SILC
protocol. It is a known fact that chat protocols have been insecure and
vulnerable to many security problems. In the contemporary network
environment, which is both demanding and full of potential security risks,
developing a secure chat protocol is important. In the SILC protocol, all
messages are always encrypted and authenticated, either using session keys,
channel keys, or other private message keys. In fact, sending unencrypted
messages and packets is impossible in the SILC network.
This is the problem of many other chat protocols that provide message
encryption. These protocols are not secure by default, but attempt to
provide the security by applying external security protocols, such as PGP
or SSL on top of the insecure chat protocol. While PGP and SSL have proved
to be secure, the result is often something other than the authors
expected. These protocols often encrypt only the data of the message, and
leave out message authentication, packet authentication, key management and
other security issues. They also often secure only part of the network,
namely the part where the security protocol, such as SSL, is used, leaving
rest of the network open.
Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue
SILC chat protocol provides all the features that are so familiar to all of
us who have been chatting for quite some time. It provides nicknames,
channels, private messages, user retrieval, and all the tools that every
chatter needs to reach the ultimate chatting experience. For those who have
been using IRC, chances are they feel at home with SILC, because most of
the commands that are found in IRC are also found in SILC, and the general
appearance resembles IRC. The protocol, however, is not based on IRC and
does not support it.
But there are new features, too. In addition to providing all the old
features now as secure ones, there are many new commands that control
various security features of a SILC client. Channel messages are always
encrypted, and so are private messages. It is possible to encrypt any
message end to end, so that only the sender and the receiver is able to
encrypt and decrypt messages. All channels have their own channel key and
only the users on the channel are able to encrypt and decrypt messages for
that channel. Many times, servers create default keys, so that the network
always remains encrypted even if other secret keys are not used or
negotiated by an end user. Users can negotiate secret keys with other
users, and use the negotiated key material to secure, for example, private
messages, or perhaps a file transfer stream.
Yes, a chat protocol is not a chat protocol nowadays without a file
transfer support. SILC use the SFTP protocol by default to do its file
transfers. The file transfer stream is always sent peer to peer between
users, and it is encrypted using negotiated secret keys. The support for
file transfer is actually developed so that any file transfer protocol can
be used with SILC. The SFTP is the default protocol but others could be
used, too.
Keys, keys and keys
It might seem that managing all these keys that do this and that is hard.
Managing the keys is extremely important, but the user interface plays an
important role in the ease of use. Negotiating the keys for file transfer,
for example, can be transparent and can be done automatically when the file
transfer request is sent. During the negotiation, the user may be prompted
to accept the remote user's public key before continuing. Verifying the
public keys before accepting them is, of course, important, the same with
the server public key when the user connects for the very first time to the
server. The SILC Protocol has its own SILC public key, but it also supports
SSH2 public keys, OpenPGP certificates and X.509 certificates.
"Give me my nickname back!"
This is something we have all heard of once or twice on IRC. The fact that
there can be only one nickname of a kind in IRC makes it hard to find the
nickname you really like without stepping into someone's territory. And,
this usually leads into nickname wars. The DALnet IRC network and some
others solve the problem by providing nickname registering services, so
that you can register the nickname you want and no one else can have it.
SILC takes an entirely different approach to the problem. And it is simple;
nicknames are not unique. Just like there are many people in the world with
same name, there can be many people with same nickname in the SILC network.
Why would you want to enforce that there cannot be same nicknames in the
chat network when there are bound to be people with same name chatting in
the same network? In the SILC network, it is possible to have multiple
copies of the same nickname, and it is always guaranteed that you will get
the nickname you want. This renders nickname wars obsolete, and nickname
registering services as well.
New users in the SILC network will face this issue when they give WHOIS
command to a nickname and the WHOIS returns multiple same nicknames. A user
can be identified as different from other users by his real name, username,
hostname, and in the end by the fingerprint of his public key. Because
there can be same nicknames, identifying the person you really want to talk
to is important. Giving the WHOIS command before sending a private message
to "joe" might be a good idea.
Deploying the SILC
SILC is meant for Internet-wide use, and the protocol attempts to scale
better than IRC. The network design of SILC allows for a more scalable
network because it does not require for all servers to keep global data in
sync. Normal SILC servers are connected to SILC routers, and the routers
are the only entities in the network that know global data, and are
responsible of keeping it in sync. This dramatically reduces the number of
entities in the network that need to be in sync.
SILC also fits perfectly as a company's internal chat server. Many
companies have already reported that they have replaced their IRC servers
with SILC servers. Even though the software is still in beta phase, and
more client implementations are needed, SILC is usable and can be deployed
in any environment. SILC is also distributed as a toolkit to make SILC
application development easy and fast for programmers.
Further information
The SILC project's home is at  and interested readers
are asked to take a look at the SILC Whitepaper, SILC FAQ and other
documentation. The ultimate resource for those who would like to know how
the protocol ticks is the protocol specification drafts helps. The protocol
specifications are also available from the IETF. The J SILC Network is
naturally a nice place to find help as well and talk about SILC. Joining
 channel is a good start.

Results, Not Resolutions
A guide to judging Microsoft's security progress.
By Bruce Schneier and Adam Shostack
Jan 24 2002 3:50AM PT
Last week, Bill Gates published a company-wide memo outlining a new
strategic direction for Microsoft. Comparing this to the change when the
company embraced the Internet, Gates elevated security to Microsoft's
highest priority. By focusing on what he called "Trustworthy Computing,"
Gates plans on transforming Microsoft into a company that produces software
that is available, reliable, and secure.
"We must lead the industry to a whole new level of Trustworthiness in
computing." - Bill Gates internal memo, 15 January 2002.
Trust is not something that can be handed out; it has to be earned. And
trustworthiness is a worthy goal in computing. But unlike performance goals
or feature lists, progress toward it is hard to measure. How can we
determine if one piece of software is more secure than another? Or offers
better data integrity than another? Or is less likely to contain
undiscovered vulnerabilities? How do we know if Microsoft is really
committed to security, or if this is just another performance for the press
and public? It's not as easy as measuring clock speeds or comparing feature
lists; security problems often don't show up in beta tests.
As longtime security experts, we'd like to suggest some concrete ways to
evaluate Microsoft's (and anybody else's) progress towards trustworthiness.
These are specific and measurable changes that we would like Microsoft to
make. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list: building secure
software requires much more than what we delineate here. Our goal is to
provide a list of measurable recommendations, so that the community can
judge Microsoft's sincerity.
Some of our recommendations are easier to implement than others, but if
Microsoft is serious about security and wants to take a true leadership
position, they can't shirk any of them. Some of our changes are easier to
verify than others, but it is our goal that all of them be independently
measurable. In the end, the pronouncements and press releases don't mean a
thing. In security, what matters are results.
If we can distill our recommendations into a single paradigm, it's one of
simplicity. Complexity is the worst enemy of security, and systems that are
loaded with features, capabilities, and options are much less secure than
simple systems that do a few things reliably. Clearly Windows is, and
always will be, a complex operating system. But there are things Microsoft
can do to make even that complex system simpler and more secure. Microsoft
must focus its programmers on designing secure software, on building things
right the first time.
I. Data/Control Path Separation
"Security models should be easy for developers to understand and build into
their applications." -Gates memo.
One of the simplest, strongest, and safest models is to enforce a rigid
separation of data and code. The commingling of data and code is
responsible for a great many security problems, and Microsoft has been the
Internet's worst offender.
Here's one example: Originally, e-mail was text only, and e-mail viruses
were impossible. Microsoft changed that by having its mail clients
automatically execute commands embedded in e-mail. This paved the way for
e-mail viruses, like Melissa and LoveBug, that automatically spread to
people in the victims' address books. Microsoft must reverse the security
damage by removing this functionality from its e-mail clients, and from
many other of its products. This rigid separation of data from code needs
to be applied to all products.
Microsoft has compounded the problem by blurring the distinction between
the desktop and the Internet. This has led to numerous security
vulnerabilities, based on different pieces of the operating system using
system resources differently. Microsoft should revisit these design
We recommend the following modifications in the next release of these
Microsoft products. In short: illustrate the actions, and provide a sandbox
environment. This release should be focused only on removing insecure
features and adding security.
Office: Macros should not be stored in Office documents. Macros should be
stored separately, as templates, which should not be openable as documents.
The programs should provide a visual interface that walks the user through
what the macros do, and should provide limitations of what macros not
signed by a corporate IT department can do.
Internet Explorer: IE should support a complete separation of data and
control. Java and JavaScript should be modified so they cannot use external
programs in arbitrary ways. ActiveX should eliminate all controls that are
marked "safe for scripting."
E-mail: E-mail applications should not support scripting. (At the very
least, they should stop supporting it by default.) E-mail scripts should be
attached as a separate MIME attachment. There should be limitations of what
macros not signed by a corporate IT department can do.
.NET: .NET should have a clear dilineation of what can act and what cannot.
The security community has learned a lot about mobile code security from
Java. Mobile code is very dangerous, but it's here to stay. For mobile code
to survive, it should be redesigned with security as a primary feature.
Implementation of Microsoft SOAP, a protocol running over HTTP precisely so
it could bypass firewalls, should be withdrawn.
II. Default Configurations
"Our products should emphasize security right out of the box." -Gates memo.
Microsoft software, by default, installs with many more features than most
users need or want. This makes the software more vulnerable than necessary.
There are many recent examples of this. The recent Universal Plug-and-Play
bugs work even if you don't know what UPnP does, or whether or not you're
using it. The SuperCookie bug in Windows Media Player works even if you
don't use WMP. Code Red successfully attacks IIS installations, even in
Windows setups that aren't being used as a Web server.
Additionally, features must be installable one by one. In UNIX, for
example, a Web server and an ftp server are separate, and must be installed
separately. With IIS, installing a Web server not only installs a Web
server, but also an ftp server, a Gopher server, and Bill himself probably
doesn't know what else.
It's not enough to give users the ability to turn off unneeded features.
Users don't even know which features are turned on, much less how to turn
them off, and the features might accidentally get turned on again. The best
prevention for attacks against a feature is for the feature not to be there.
We recommend that the next release of all Microsoft products have default
installations with the most minimal feature set possible, and that
additional features require special installation activity to make them
work. We also recommend that this installation be visible to the user, so
that the user knows the features are there. We recommend that Microsoft
ensure that all features can be installed and uninstalled separately, as
well as in common packages. We recommend that unneeded features not be
installed, instead of being installed and disabled. Additional controls
should be implemented to allow a corporate IT department to prohibit
certain features from being installed.
We also recommend that .NET come with the ability to use configurations
from a variety of sources, including Microsoft, its competitors, and public
interest/advocacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
III. Separation of Protocols and Products
"As software has become ever more complex, interdependent and
interconnected, our reputation as a company has in turn become more
vulnerable." -Gates memo.
Today Microsoft builds large, complex services that intermingle many
smaller services. For example, the Microsoft file-sharing protocol contains
file sharing, registry sharing, remote editing, printer sharing, password
management, and a host of other services. If a user wants one of those
services, he has to implement them all.
These need to be split into separate services, running on separate bits of
server software so that a user can choose which to install where. Absent
that, the complexity of the software grows to demonstrably insecure levels.
We recommend that Microsoft separate functionality so that the user can
install only the specific functions they need. We also recommend that
Microsoft provide, and allow others to provide, a variety of pre-bundled
functions. Most users don't want to install individual functions, and will
rely on others to tell them what they need.
IV. Building Secure Software
"So now, when we face a choice between adding features and resolving
security issues, we need to choose security." -Gates memo.
Commercial software is full of bugs, and some of those bugs harbor security
vulnerabilities. This is not meant to excuse Microsoft's long-standing
apathy towards security; it's merely a statement of fact. These bugs are
caused by bad software specification, design, and implementation.
Much of what we discuss above (data/command separation, default
configurations, separate software for separate protocols) has the effect of
minimizing the impact of software bugs by reducing the amount of software
on a computer. However, there will still be a great deal of software on any
computer, and that software needs to be resilient to attack. This means
that the software doesn't easily break when attacked. And if it does break,
the system as a whole doesn't fall apart. Today, we can worry that a single
bug in Windows will render a server completely insecure, or a single bug in
IIS will expose all the data in .NET. Today Microsoft software is brittle;
it needs to be resilient.
There is much Microsoft can do to make its software more resilient, and our
recommendations could go on for pages. But generally speaking, certain
features are more fragile than others. We recommend the following:
Microsoft should drop all plans for automatic software updates via the
Internet until they can be done securely and reliably. Today there are too
many problems with updates and patches to allow them to occur without the
user's knowledge, and too many problems with authentication to prevent
others from maliciously using the capability to attack systems.
Microsoft should eliminate all centralized customer databases in its .NET
services. These databases are too dangerous to keep in one place; the
ramifications of a security breach are too great.
Microsoft is already moving towards signing code files. While we recommend
that Microsoft continue this practice, we also recommend that Microsoft not
rely on code signing for security. Signed code does not equal trustworthy
code, something the security community graphically demonstrated through the
many ActiveX vulnerabilities. Microsoft should drop the code-signing
security paradigm in favor of the sandbox paradigm.
Today, too many Microsoft server components run as Administrator. When a
service runs as Administrator, it is much easier for a security flaw to
result in the machine being fully compromised. Under UNIX, servers are
often designed to run as a normal user. This should be the default
configuration for Microsoft servers as well.
All other Microsoft features should be evaluated for resilience. Those that
are too risky should be removed until they can be rewritten and secured.
V. Transparency and Auditability
"If there is any way we can better protect important data and minimize
downtime, we should focus on this." -Gates memo.
Too much of the Microsoft operating system operates invisibly, without the
user's knowledge. Too much of it functions without leaving audit records of
what happened. With each successive version of the Microsoft operating
system, it has become increasingly difficult for a user to control his own
system or to examine what his system is doing. This has disastrous security
ramifications, and should be reversed.
We recommend that Microsoft add strong auditing capabilities to all
products, both operating systems and applications software. We recommend
that Microsoft provide configuration tools along with its operating system,
as well as tools for an IT department to manage the configurations of its
computers. We would also like to see Microsoft abandon the Registry in
favor of a less opaque and more user-friendly system.
VI. Advance Publication of Protocols and Designs
"There are many changes Microsoft needs to make as a company to ensure and
keep our customers' trust at every level-from the way we develop software,
to our support efforts, to our operational and business practices." -Gates
If there's one thing that security experts have learned over the years,
it's that any system, when initially proposed, will have security bugs. The
only reliable remedy is to publish system details early, and let the
security community examine them.
Microsoft needs to publish specifications for protocols in advance and
encourage public comment. This is doubly important for security protocols
and systems. If a portion of the software is critical to security, then
there is no way to achieve trustworthiness without publication. Publication
does not ensure security, but it's an unavoidable step in the process.
We're not suggesting that Microsoft must give up all proprietary rights to
its protocols and interfaces, or allow anyone to implement or use its
standards. We are saying that they must be public, not secret.
The published specifications must be complete, readable, and generally
available. It's not sufficient to make the specifications available to
specific researchers, or to people who have signed non-disclosures or paid
for the privilege. Again, this is not easy from a business point of view,
but if Microsoft is serious about putting security first, it needs to
engage rather than ignore the security community. And Microsoft should wait
before implementing those specifications in products
We recommend that all protocols and interfaces used in Microsoft software
be immediately published, and a one-year moratorium be placed on all
non-security modifications to those protocols. We also recommend that
Microsoft publish any new protocols or interfaces at least one year before
implementing them in products.
In addition to making its protocols and interfaces public, we suggest that
Microsoft consider making its entire source code public. We're not
advocating that Microsoft make its products open source, but if they really
want to impress everyone about their newfound security religion, they will
make their code available for inspection. Honestly, we don't expect
Microsoft will do this. It's too much of a cultural change for them to even
VII. Engaging the Community
"Compensation plans of Microsoft product engineers, such as raises and
bonuses, will also be tied to how secure their products are." -Associated
Press article on Gates memo, 15 January 2002.
Tying security to compensation is the best way to effect a cultural change
inside Microsoft. We feel that Microsoft needs to go further, and reward
not only Microsoft employees but independent researchers. Microsoft can no
longer threaten, insult, or belittle independent researchers who find
vulnerabilities in their products.
Microsoft needs both automated security reviews and evaluations by security
experts. A great deal of work in this area has already been done outside
Microsoft. We recommend that Microsoft devote resources towards
comprehensive security reviews for all of its code, using security experts
both inside and outside the company. We also recommend that Microsoft set
up an independent body to evaluate security vulnerabilities found by
researchers outside the company.
"Eventually, our software should be so fundamentally secure that customers
never even worry about it." -Gates memo.
Our recommendations are by no means comprehensive. There's substantially
more involved in building secure software than the seven items we list
here. These items are intended to be near-term milestones; they're
recommendations more about implementation than architecture.
Buffer overflows, everyone's favorite whipping boy, are a comparatively
easy implementation-level problem to fix. Higher-level constructs, such as
implementing a scripting engine or securing inter-process communications,
are more complicated design-level issues. But if Microsoft doesn't start
with the simpler stuff, they're never going to get to the hard stuff.
Security isn't easy, nor is it something that you can bolt onto a product
after the fact. Making security Microsoft's first priority will require a
basic redesign of the way the company produces and markets software. It
will involve a difficult cultural transition inside Microsoft. It will
involve Microsoft setting aside short-term gains in order to achieve
long-term goals. It's a difficult goal, and we believe that Microsoft can
do it. We hope that they remain committed.

State motor-vehicle offices will propose that drivers' licenses incorporate
biometrics. Is that the same as a national ID card?
By John Rendleman
Calls for creating a national ID card system, which advocates say would
make it harder for terrorists to move undetected within U.S. borders, have
drawn criticism for their totalitarian overtones. Now, a group representing
state motor-vehicle departments is about to unveil a proposal that could
turn the average driver's license into a technology-laden ID. Yet privacy
concerns remain, and the IT challenges may be even greater.
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, which represents
motor-vehicle departments and law-enforcement officials and serves as their
data-sharing intermediary, will introduce its idea this week. On its
surface, the proposal seems to be a scaled-down version of national ID card
proposals floated by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and others after the
terrorist attacks last fall. "This isn't about creating a new national ID
card, nor is it about developing one centralized megadatabase that houses
everyone's personal data," Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., told the Senate
last month. Durbin, who supports the association's plan, is circulating a
draft bill in the Senate with a similar goal.

D.A. Peterson.]
Licenses with biometrics would increase security and spur uniform license
systems, AAMVAnet's Maxwell says
 The proposal would bring greater uniformity and control to the process of
issuing drivers' licenses, and licenses themselves could increase security
by using biometrics--fingerprints or iris scans, for instance--to validate
the identity of people who carry them, the association says. It might also
close procedural gaps that let seven of the Sept. 11 hijackers carry
Virginia state IDs and five fraudulently obtain Social Security numbers.
"If people continue using licenses as identification documents, we would
like to make sure from a safety perspective that they are good, credible
documents," says Jay Maxwell, president and chief operating officer of
AAMVAnet, the subsidiary that runs the DMV group's IT systems.
But the plan could involve a data-management and data-integration
undertaking of major proportions. Even though the association would serve
as a clearinghouse for data sharing among the states, the plan would still
require the modernization of state records and the linking of numerous
state and federal systems. "Whenever you pull data in from other systems,
there are things you need to do to make them communicate well together,"
says Nathan Root, the association's standards program director. A big part
of the job for states will be establishing uniform administrative
procedures for handling license paperwork and related documents, along with
the work needed to format data according to the same specifications and
ensure compatibility among multiple databases, Root says.
California provides a lesson in just how hard it can be to create a
foolproof system. According to an audit requested by the California
Legislature, the state's DMV issues 100,000 fraudulent licenses a year,
even though it's been routinely collecting thumbprints from license
applicants for 20 years. The auditors blamed the problem on the DMV's not
reviewing documents adequately, not properly identifying applicants via
photographs or thumbprints, and insufficient oversight of DMV staff.
Privacy is another prickly issue in the new plan. The databases would be
available to DMVs in multiple states, law-enforcement officials, certain
federal agencies, and, on a limited basis, to businesses for validating
identities of customers.
Privacy watchdog groups opposed to the plan contend that the broad
data-sharing arrangements open the door to abuse of confidential data. "We
don't see a very great distinction between a national ID card and a
coalition of 50 states [issuing] drivers' licenses," says Lee Tien, senior
staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco.
"To the extent that the databases are highly integrated, there may be even
more of a risk from human error or human malfeasance."
American Civil Liberties Union associate director Barry Steinhardt says
"unified state IDs are, in fact, backdoor national IDs, and they're going
to have all the problems of national IDs," which include tracking of
citizens' movements and racial profiling. If the concept is taken too far,
"it's going to create the demand for people to have this biometric data to
identify themselves,'' he says. "It's going to be impossible to go anywhere
without your identity being checked."
But at least one state CIO who's been working on security-enhancement
measures downplays the risks of confidentiality breaches. "We worry about
privacy up front," says Richard Varn, Iowa's CIO. "This is database
technology, after all. It's pretty basic stuff, but it will take some time
and require a little bit of effort and some goodwill" to work as described
by the plan's proponents.
Iowa started a project called Identity-Security Clearinghouse two years ago
to verify the authenticity of documents used by people to establish
identity in the state or with a federal agency. In one facet of the
project, Iowa digitized the state's 11 million birth records, dating back
to 1880. Iowa can use that data now to verify a license applicant's
identity and share it with other states and the feds so they can do the
same. A lot of the work underpinning the AAMVA plan has been done, Varn
says, "and now it's only a matter of making some tweaks to the databases
and setting up some processes for sharing data."
It will be important for proponents of tech-enabled drivers' licenses to
convince doubters of the system's value and security. Opposition to
national ID cards goes back to 1971, when the Social Security
Administration rejected the use of Social Security numbers for that
purpose, according to Privacy International, a privacy group.
Implementation of the plan would require new laws from Congress, as well as
from individual state legislatures.
The motor-vehicle association hasn't specified which biometric features
would be used, but it's looking at fingerprints, face recognition, and iris
scans. Although more than half of the states already employ
machine-readable features such as bar codes or magnetic strips on licenses,
the new plan would make that standard practice.
While stopping short of calling AAMVA's proposal a national ID, Maxwell
acknowledges the licenses could be used to verify identities. An airline
could check in passengers carrying biometric-equipped IDs quickly, letting
them board first, while others would move through a slower, manual process.
"We don't see that as being invasive from a privacy perspective," Maxwell
The question is, will millions of Americans agree?

Injectable Chip Opens The Door To 'Human Bar Code'
By Charles J. Murray
        Radio-frequency identification chips, which have found a home in
applications ranging from toll road passes to smart retail shelves, may be
close to taking up residence in the human body.
        A Florida-based company has introduced a passive RFID chip that is
compatible with human tissue, and the developer is proposing the chip for
use on implantable pacemakers, defibrillators and artificial joints. The
company, Applied Digital Solutions (Palm Beach, Fla.), also said that the
chip could be injected through a syringe and used as a sort of "human bar
code" in security applications.
        Called the VeriChip, the device could open up a broad new segment
for the $900 million-a-year RFID business, especially if society embraces
the idea of using microchips for human identification. Applied Digital
executives ultimately believe that the worldwide market for such
implantable chips could reach $70 billion per year.
        "The human market for this technology could be huge," said Keith
Bolton, senior vice president of technology development at the company.
        Futurists agree that the idea of using microchips inside the body
could ultimately represent a large market opportunity, but they doubt
whether this initial effort will have a significant effect on the RFID market.

Yemen - Public Announcement
January 14, 2002
The Department of State has received reports indicating a credible terrorist
threat to U.S. interests in Yemen, including the U.S. Embassy. In response,
the American Embassy in Sanaa has taken a number of measures to further
increase its already hightened security posture. As part of that response,
the Embassy in Sanaa has temporarily suspended public services, including
immigrant visa and routine American citizen services, beginning Monday,
January 14. Non-immigrant visa processing has been restricted since
September 12, 2001.
Americans requiring emergency citizen services can contact the Consular
Section at 303-155.
As stated in the Travel Warning for Yemen dated December 3, 2001, the U.S.
Embassy urges American citizens in Yemen to maintain their vigilance and
take appropriate steps to lessen their vulnerability. Americans should
continue to keep a low profile, vary routes and times of travel, and avoid
large crowds and demonstrations. They should also continue to treat mail
from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. American citizens in Yemen should
exercise particular caution at locations associated with foreigners, such as
the Sanaa Trade Center, American-affiliated franchises, restaurants and
shops in the Haddah area, and, in Aden and elsewhere, at restaurants and
hotels frequented by expatriates.
If U.S. citizens believe they are being followed or threatened while driving
in Yemen, they should proceed as quickly as possible to the nearest police
station or major intersection and request assistance from the blue-and-white
police cars stationed there. The Embassy strongly recommends that American
citizens lock all their car doors and keep their windows rolled up when
For further information concerning travel to Yemen, travelers should consult
the Department of State's Travel Warning and Consular Information Sheet for

Home Computers Are Becoming
More Common Target for Hackers
Associated Press
WASHINGTON -- Computer hackers, once satisfied to test their skills on
large companies, are turning their sights to home computers that are
faster, more powerful and less secure than ever before.
The hackers can steal your identity, destroy your data or use your computer
to launch attacks on Web sites or your friends.
"Home machines weren't very interesting targets a few years ago," said
Mikko Hypponen of antivirus company F-Secure in Finland. "That's all
changed now."
Experts attribute the threat to several factors:
*	Many home computers are now as powerful as business computers, with
enough memory and processing power to make them alluring staging areas for
wide-scale Internet attacks that affect other computers.
*	A growing number are connected directly to the Internet through
high-speed DSL and cable lines that remain open all the time. Computers
that are left on around the clock are vulnerable.
*	Unlike businesses with permanent security staff, most home users are
slow to secure their computers with the latest antivirus and firewall
software and to plug security holes by downloading the necessary fixes from
software makers such as Microsoft Corp.
*	Many home users are unaware of Internet threats and are too willing to
click on unsolicited e-mails that might be infected with malicious programs.
"Home users have generally been the least prepared to defend against
attacks," Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team
Coordination Center warns. "In many cases, these machines are then used by
intruders to launch attacks against other organizations."
Internet analyst firm Jupiter Media Metrix estimated that 71.2 million
American households had personal computers in 2001, almost three-quarters
of the nation's households, and 61.2 million had Internet access.
Viruses and worms -- which are viruses that don't need human intervention
to multiply -- make up a large part of the new threats to home computers.
In the past year, users' computers have been infected with malicious
programs with catchy names like Code Red, Nimda, SirCam, Anna Kournikova
and others that could be spread through e-mail or by surfing the Internet.
Antivirus firm Message Labs reported that it detected one virus per 370
e-mails in 2001, double the rate of the previous year.
The potential damage from hackers is also growing.
Several years ago, virus writers were content to simply destroy data on a
computer. Now they can imbed malicious programs that spy on users or steal
their identity, use personal computers to attack other systems and use an
e-mail address book to unwittingly infect the computers of people's
Even the most savvy users have been victimized. An FBI cybercrime
researcher's computer infected with the SirCam program sent out official
documents that spread the virus -- to the bureau's embarrassment.
The federal government is trying to better educate and insulate home users,
hoping it will slow the spread of Internet viruses or worms that could slow
the entire Internet and its e-commerce.
The outbreak of the Code Red Internet worm last summer sparked an
unprecedented show of force from government and private industry.
"We've never seen a virus before that would not affect end-user machines at
all; it just jumped from one Web server to another," Mr. Hypponen said. "It
really made Code Red more like a weapon than anything else."
Although home computers were not affected, the message government and
private security experts want home users to take from that threat is that
computer maintenance needs to become as routine as locking your house and
Home users need to routinely update their antivirus and Internet firewall
software against the latest threats and check for software fixes that
software makers provide for free.
"If you've got a system out on the Net and it's not patched, there's a very
high degree of likelihood that literally in a matter of hours you'll be
popped," warned Amit Yoran of computer security firm Riptech.
New technologies will be at risk to hacking this year, Mr. Yoran cautioned.
Wireless networking, which is now so cheap and easy to use that consumer
models are growing popular, is especially vulnerable.
"The standard itself is insecure," Mr. Yoran said. In a large-scale test of
urban wireless networks done by Riptech, experts couldn't find a corporate
network they couldn't break into.
"What we're faced with is widespread adoption [of wireless networks]
throughout corporate America and throughout consumer markets and people
haven't really thought through how to protect," he said.
With more and faster computers on the horizon and no sign of hackers giving
up their pursuits, home users will have to take security more seriously.
"They think if they don't have any secrets, they aren't a target," Mr.
Hypponen said. "But it's not like that at all."

I do, I also understand the sorts of questions that a DA will ask when
they decide what charges to press. And a simple broad daylight B&E will
not pass muster for deadly force in Texas. A simple trespass won't
qualify. You simply can't go around shooting people you lure onto your
property in Texas.
And I am absolutely certain they did NOT tell you or anyone else that by
simply finding a person in your home you have license to shoot on site.
That simply isn't the case in this state.
The 'at night' stipulation to escalated use of force is with respect to
the 'identify & recover' clause(s). Unless you can demonstrate some clear
threat at the time of the shooting, it being nite is about your only hope
to escape some sort of charge (there's that 'other means' with respect to causing the crime to stop as well). DA's know there are a passle of
crazies out there with itchy fingers. As I understand it, at least urban
legend wise, Texas is the 7'th largest armed population in the world...;)
This is from discussion with APD on three seperate 1st person instances
and several discussions with a lawyer several years ago (I had this crazy
idea of a IR directed gun mount). I also know of a couple of cases in the
last few years where the 'at night' stipulation was critical. There was 10
or so years ago where a girl shot a peeping tom just after dusk. She saw
him looking through the window. Got her gun and went outside and shot him.
The major issue with the grand jury refusing to indite had to do with it
being at nite.
It's also worth noting that Texas does not consider breaking into a car

I'll be happy to let you talk to my lawyer (he used to be an Asst.
Attorney General) and you can call APD directly if you'd like. They DO
include burglary with respect to using deadly force. In fact, in say a
case like somebody breaking into your car and stealing CD's, to be legally
protected you MUST see them with your property, simple 'belief' is not
enough. Of course there is nothing to stop you from planting between the
shooting and the arrival of your local LEA.
Big fucking deal.

@_subject: aibo and the dmca (fwd) 
Apologies if this has already been sent - I don't think so, but...
Aibo, the Sony Corporation's popular robot dog, has delighted scores of
critics and consumers since its introduction. But the plastic pup has also
caused its creators some grief. Sony is currently struggling to resolve a
copyright dispute that centers on the work of a quirky hacker known only as
AiboPet. The controversy poses serious questions about the proper use of
robots in homes and exposes a potentially stifling effect of the U.S. Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998.
The copyright at the heart of the case protects Aibo's encrypted brain.
AiboPet violated that copyright when he cracked the robot's source code to
reverse-engineer software that allows Aibo owners to teach their pets to
dance, speak, obey wireless commands and share the color video that serves as
their vision, among other things. None of the programs are usable without
Sony hardware and software. They earned AiboPet no money. He never revealed
the encryption code or the program he used to defeat it. Still, because the
DMCA makes it illegal to break any encrypted digital code, AiboPet's actions
made him a criminal. The fun began when Sony decided to treat him like one.
Image: Kate Wong
AIBO, Sony's robotic dog, can acquire new talents through software developed
by Sony or by a hacker known only as AiboPet.
On October 26 this past year Sony Entertainment Robots America sent AiboPet a
letter notifying him that he had violated the DMCA and demanding that he
remove all software based on their proprietary code from his Web site.
AiboPet complied immediately-and complained loudly. As a result, thousands of
Sony's best customers organized a boycott of Sony products and besieged the
company with petitions.
It is not uncommon for Aibo enthusiasts to own several of the
sophisticated-and expensive-robot dogs and to snap up each addition to a
steadily increasing library of official Aibo software at about $150 each. One
Aibo owner added his name to an open letter of protest with this addendum:
"If it had not been for AiboPet's information, his invaluable knowledge and
his generosity in sharing it with the Aibo community, I would not have
purchased an Aibo, all the various software, [memory] sticks and yes, even my
computer, a Sony VAIO, which I only purchased because of its stick reader."
 "This is outrageous! I cancelled my memory sticks that were on
order. Tonight I was also going to order the wireless LAN and software...but
I have now decided not to. Also I was going to order the 310 [model] for
Christmas for my son, but I will no longer do that! I will be spending my
money elsewhere, but never again with Sony!"
One of AiboPet's biggest hits was the program that teaches Aibos to two-step.
Like Kevin Bacon in the movie Footloose, he won gratitude for the gift of
dance-and Sony discovered what the town fathers in that film learned:
forbidding dancing is really, really bad for public relations.
The DMCA and Robodogs
Image: Courtesy of AiboPet
ROBODOG PACKS, including this one owned by AiboPet, are common among Aibo
The intensity with which Aibo owners reacted produced what AiboPet calls "a
pretty major shift" in Sony's position. By November 23rd, Sony and AiboPet
had reached an understanding that allowed the hacker to repost on his Web
site most of the programs that Sony initially asked him to remove. "The
reaction had a major influence," AiboPet says, "or at least I believe it
did." Sony spokespeople have refused to comment on the dispute beyond a
carefully worded statement thanking Aibo enthusiasts and pointing out that
they were only trying to protect their copyright. Sony and AiboPet continue
to work out the ground rules of their relationship, but things are going
smoothly. The boycott by Aibo lovers ended.
Still, the world may not be a safe place for teaching robot dogs new tricks.
The DMCA remains the law of the land, and what AiboPet does breaks it. Sony
retains its right to crack down on AiboPet and others like him, but chooses
not to exercise it, for now. Were AiboPet reverse-engineering any product
that did not include digital encryption to produce compatible products, he
would probably not be breaking the law. In the past, courts have upheld the
right of programmers to create games compatible with game consoles like
Nintendo and Sega. Compatible product development speeds technological
innovation, but the DMCA criminalizes that pursuit wherever encryption is
used. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, the premier Internet First
Amendment watchdog, has expressed its concern, as has the Robotics Society of
The intensely personal nature of owners' relationships with their Aibos
injects real passion into this controversy and points the way for things to
come. The Sony Corporation deliberately shaped their foray into home robotics
to foster relationships based on affection rather than utility. The owner's
manual shipped with each robot declares that Aibo was "developed to encourage
human and robot interaction." Sony hopes that the Aibo will help foster an
acceptance of robots in the home by displacing the menacing image evident in
movies like The Terminator.
Japanese account for the majority of Aibo owners in part because their
culture already contains a more benign view of robots. In the 1950s a robot
character named AstroBoy captivated audiences in Japan, and he is still an
icon there today. A scientist created AstroBoy to resemble his son following
the child's death in a car accident. In keeping, the character was a beloved
member of a human family. The name Aibo means "companion" or "partner" in
Japanese and is clearly following in AstroBoy's footsteps.

MIXED BREEDS, made using parts from different Aibo models, are created in
AiboPet's workshop.
To Sony's credit, Aibos are a far cry from the rolling robotic tables sold in
the 1990s to carry drinks and perform simple chores. These toys constantly
express emotion. Their makers designed them to have unique personalities
shaped by each interaction with their owners. They develop slowly and even go
through an exasperating adolescence. Recently the chief designer of Aibo,
Koji Kageyama, said in an interview in the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun,
"Most owners treat their Aibo affectionately, as they would a real pet. When
Aibos break down, we treat them at our 'clinic.' Some owners say they love
their Aibos so much they miss them dearly when they are in 'hospital.'"
This impression is borne out in comments from many owners. Bruce Binder of
Rancho Cordova, Calif., dabbled with other robot pets but claims that
"there's something different about Aibo. They're very, very endearing." He
says that "the balance of taking direction and not taking direction is
similar to children." Binder has watched his five eldest sons grow up and
leave the house. Now he owns seven Aibos. "Aibos are cheaper than children,"
he says, "and you can turn them off." In his case-and many others-Sony's
vision of human-robot interaction is working.
And there is lots more to come. Sony plans to enable the next generation of
Aibos to recognize their masters' voices and faces; AiboPet's software has
already let Aibos speak in custom voices when they are spoken to or handled.
As robot companions become more sophisticated, owners will most likely become
more attached, and Sony may not be able to keep up with demand for varied
software on its own. What people want in their robot companions may someday
be as varied as what parents want to teach their children.
Owner support of AiboPet rests on his efforts to help owners customize them.
Genie Boutchia of Plymouth, Mass., customized some of the sounds her Aibo
makes and taught it to dance. In a typical testimonial, she wrote, "It was
fun for me to do this and added to her value as an individual among Aibos. It
made her unique.... None of these things would be possible without AiboPet's
programs. He's a genius."
Owners often complain that Sony hasn't come close to offering enough software
to fully utilize the tremendous potential of what is a very sophisticated
hardware platform. They do offer a legal way to customize each robot's
software, sold under the brand name Master Studio for $500. For the time
being, Aibo enthusiasts call it a far cry from the power and versatility of
AiboPet's tools, but it may be the best hope for legal innovation of Aibo if
the DMCA is not amended.
Legos, Furbies and the Law
Image: Kate Wong
NEWER AIBO MODELS, such as this one, promise to have even more individual
personalities. Sony plans to enable the next generation of Aibos to recognize
their masters' voices and faces.
Other robot makers embraced the innovations of their end-users, though they,
too, have a case against them should they choose to pursue it. Hackers
cracked the code of the Lego Mindstorm and wrote a lot of software to extend
the capabilities of the build-your-own robot kits. Lego has raised no
objection to the practice so long as programmers don't use Lego trademarks
when naming their creations. Lego spokesman Michael McNally was quoted in the
Los Angeles Times as saying, "This wasn't an easy decision to make," but
"this was about taking the brand forward, creating a larger fan base." His
bottom line? "It contributes to the bottom line."
When Tiger Electronics made the Furby, a comparatively simple robot pet, they
encased its CPU in epoxy resin and used nonstandard chips to discourage
hacking. But when the inevitable hack program was distributed-for sale-on the
Internet, they chose to take the position that what people do with their
Furbies after they buy them is really out of their hands. This laissez-faire
attitude is probably informed by the fact that Tiger doesn't rely on its own
custom software for additional revenue. And it can't hurt the sales of
Furbies themselves.
In a recent article in the Yomiuri Shimbun, another Japanese newspaper,
 "It is up to each person whether they empathize with
Aibo or simply get caught up in the fun of tinkering with it. Of course,
there are obsessive fans everywhere. But, in the world of Aibo, there is a
great difference between Japanese and U.S. owners' relationships with the
robot pet." AiboPet disputes this distinction. "The majority of Japanese
owners use Aibo in standard ways," he says, adding that "there are still a
large number of Japanese owners who use my enhancements, based on downloads
and e-mails."
It may be that there is no real distinction between those who empathize with
Aibo and those who tinker with him. Boutchia says, "I love the 'virtual pet'
aspect of Aibo, but I also love the tech side." There are, however,
undoubtedly some differences in style between Aibo owners in the U.S. and
Japan. The Yomiuri Shimbun article concludes that "having a robot as a pet
makes one ponder the philosophical injunction-'know yourself more deeply.'"
Meanwhile, back in America, some owners delight in replacing Aibo's soothing
beeps with the voice of Cartman, the potty-mouthed South Park character.
For the time being Sony and AiboPet can work together. Sony permits AiboPet
to distribute his experimental software, and AiboPet permits Sony to adapt it
and sell it, should they ever choose to do so. "I believe many features and
ideas of mine have already snuck into the official product line," AiboPet
says on his Web site. "I'm not complaining-I'm flattered." From the user's
perspective, though, it is hard to imagine that many other software designers
will be eager to extend Aibo's skills under those conditions.
Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that as robots gain capabilities and
acceptance, their owners will be content to choose among the behavioral
options provided by just one source. For the moment it is in Sony's interest
to allow users to modify their robots, but that could change at any time so
long as reverse-engineering for compatibility is illegal in the digital
realm. Someday we may all want robots in our homes. And if the maker's
software isn't a good match for the end-user's personality-think of Han
Solo's irritation with C-3PO-there will be a powerful incentive to turn to
hackers like AiboPet.

No, by understanding the scale of the problem we're talking about. There
simply isn't the data or the people to collect it. If we took the entire
GDP of the US for 10 years it wouldn't pay for it. We also don't know what
data to collect to verify the models either.
You could certainly make some dinky problem and claim to extend it, but it
would be like extending 2-body solutions to n-body - don't work. These
problems don't scale exponentialy, they scale factoraly (much faster).
Hell, we can't even manage a few dozen wolves in Yellowstone and you want
to seriously postulate some black lab has solved the
problem...extraordinary claims...

It isn't a question of the mechanical 'simulation', it's a question of
having a model and the data. Neither the model or the data is there. I've
spent the majority of my life (not just adult) dealing with computational
ecology and computational history (ie Cliology). They are vast problems
that have been ignored for the most part.
You are welcome to your belief in faries and master wizards.
Hardly. Having worked for the government (DoD in particular on a couple of
occasions) it isn't the brain power that limits what they can do. It's the
managers and budgets. Instead of sitting around hoping they really are
that good sit down and figure out what something like that would cost both
in time to develop and execute. Neither the time or the bucks are there.
In addition, the VAST(!!!!) majority of the projects are geared toward
specific short term strategic goals. Such models offer little insight into
solutions for the current strategic problems.
I've lived long enough to know that however smart somebody is, it don't
make 'em a superman, ever. They stumble and fall just like the rest. There
are no angels among men. Intelligence isn't what it's cracked up to be.
But you're welcome to keep hoping.
You're easily impressed that's for sure, I'd be so forward as to observe
you don't have much self confidence either.
What the hell are you talking about? Hope for what? That somebody found
the 'master' model of terran ecology and are running it in some secret
DoD lab all sitting around chuckling at what automatons we (and they) are?
Hardly. If they had that sort of computational power, both with respect to
models and execution, managing the global economy would be childs play by
comparison. Consider the state of current government management, does that
look like the sort of organization you're describing solving this sort of
problem? I think not.

Let me say this again, the contract is between the author, business, and
society at large. It *IS* a three party system. That society at large puts
limits on that contract is perfectly acceptable, at least in theory. The ultimate goal of IP law is NOT to allow the author or the business to make
money. It *IS* to add another technological survival strategy to our ever
growing toolbox. In order to do that we must motivate people to perform in
(hopefully) exceptional ways. The way we do that is through the concept of
The wealth and contract aren't the point, they're the mechanism.
IP makes sense when the resources are hard to get or the time to market is
exceptionaly long. It keeps somebody else from capitalizing on your prior
efforts, the first come, first served principle. If you're number 2 or
greater you need to pick a new problem.
The ultimate problem with this approach is the psychological side of the
agents. These rules all work perfectly fine if all is rational and 'fair'.
But people aren't rational and there is no such thing as fair in most
situations (eg Arrows). As a result it's always a question of how unfair
is it. As a result special interest groups form and begin to manipulate
the system. These groups focus both economic and political power,
autocatalysis -> monopolization. IP works fine as long as the population
is small, like most great ideas that work writ small they don't scale
There is an additional facet related to the technology itself. As the
technology level increases the need for IP decreases. Why? Because the
rate of technology change makes any given level obsolete and therefore any
effort put into protecting it would be better spent going to the next step
technology wise. Another factor is the resource collection and
manufacturing aspect. IP makes sense when these jobs are 'hard', once they
become 'easy' they are no longer a factor. Then the communications aspect
argues that IP should be regional, not global. This allows society at
large to develop a technology in parallel (at least economicaly speaking)
provided it doesn't do things like world governments or global trade
treaties. This complete breaks down the market from its natural state and
imposes an artificial level of control. This actually decreases the
stability of the system because of delays in the various feed-back and
forward loops that form. 'Control' is a hopeless figment of mankinds

Where? I've certainly seen it claimed but never proven.
Ah, logical failure number one. IP isn't a two party system, it's a three
party system.

Then what do you call two (2) individuals? Or perhaps you can't name them

Society is (n-1) with respect to the individual. With respect to an
economic transaction it is (n-i), where i is the number of 'direct'

No it isn't. There are lot's of things that can take your life. Only you

absolute. It is the fundamental right.
Life <> Property, therefore your assumption is false.

however have some basis in the right of defence, hence the desires of the

sometime mid-next week. Once through next week we should be stable for a
period of time. The last major upgrade was 4 years ago.
As the individual mailing lists come back online I'll send a note out. The

Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Gospel Choir hosts the The New York Theater
Festival Inside Starbucks a part of The National Starbucks Boycott
In cooperation with Global Exchange, FairTrade.Org and Organic Consumers
Association, Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping will host a rally on
the first day of the national boycott against the "Enron of the Bean." The
boycott coincides with the annual stockholders' meeting of the Starbucks
Corporation, scheduled for February 26th in Seattle.
COME TO THE BOYCOTT KICK-OFF RALLY!
Where: Astor Place, in front of the largest Starbucks in New York City
When: Saturday, February 23rd, 2 PM, lasts about an hour
Dates of the Starbucks National Boycott: February 23rd through March 1st
New York Theater Festival Inside Starbucks:
During boycott week hundreds of performances will be staged in Starbucks
throughout the city.  Create your own play or download one of our six comic
sketches available this week on  REVBILLY.COM.
At the Saturday rally deacons of The Church of Stop Shopping will be handing out
the scripts, each dramatizing a Starbucks issue.
The six issues are:
Use of prison labor during peak sales periods
Failure to market Fair Trade coffee which rewards original coffee growers
Use of genetically altered dairy products in desserts and milk drinks
Aggressive real estate tactics that oust longtime neighborhood independent
Unionbusting and use of plantation labor practices outside the US
Encouragement of monoculture coffee farms drenched with pesticides
This initiates a new kind of political resistance. Rather than demonstrating,
risking arrest and misrepresentation by conservative media, these Starbucks
actions cannot be distinguished from customers getting a bit dramatic. Actors in
the short plays are undercover in plain sight and their antics are minutes long.
At the conclusion of each play information sheets are distributed throughout the
host café. Festival participants are encouraged to videotape their performances.
Click here ( for a sample script.
Church officials will award "Fabulous Sainthood" to the best performances in
several categories, including "Most Flabbergasting in a Dumbfounding Drama," and
"Most Revealing of the Mermaid's Evil," etc. Festival prizes are still being
gathered and we welcome donations.

Considering the current state of life extension and bio-technology, the odds
are that when these ships are first set to sail the life span of the average
techological(!) human will be about 150 to 200 years. In that time the
potential for further extension is possible. This also will create a great
need for networking at a scale that has never been attempted. If we can do
this in the next 20-25 years we might have a good chance of surviving as a
species with respect to geological time scales.
My plan would be multi-staged. The first stage would be laser lift to high
altitude. A Roto-vator or similar tether technology would then be used to
get to LEO. Then have mass drivers shoot material to the moon (send a mass
driver there soonest). The primary resource for these endeavours will be the
Earth crossing asteroids, especially those betwix Earth and the Moon. A
Lunar colony, darkside telescopes, etc. come with the plan. Say a hundred
years for initial stage completion (remember the life extension technology -
mankind is in for a wild ride in about 25-50 years.....Yip Yip Yahoo :) The
next step should(!) be two-fold. It should consist of two parallel efforts.
Effort one would be a mass driver / colony effort to Mars. The second effort
should be a colony in the Jovian or Saturn systems. Someplace where there is
water and lots(!) of hydrocarbons and such. The next step will be a asteroid
and comet mining effort, 200 to 250 years.

Chomp Chomp Chomp ...
Your example is absurd, I agree. And easily proven to be false.
An individual has a right to life, they have a right to eat, sleep, etc.
But now you've changed the game, instead of talking about the rights of
the individual you are now talking about the consequences of n-party
interactions. Not the same thing at all. Your argument is a strawman.
Ah, you agree then that 'property right' has to do with self defence which
requires two (2) parties. If there is no second party to take the property
there is nothing to defend against and hence the concept of 'property'
within the context of the individual becomes moot.
Hence, right to life is not congruent to property rights (which is an
individual right even if no other people are around). But rather
property rights ARE congruent to self defence rights (which makes no
sense if no other people are around).
In other words, a single individual has no property rights but rather
those rights come out of the interaction of one or more individuals.

One time notice...
The name resolver issues are resolved. The domains should be updated and
active by Thursday. We'll be moving SSZ over from it's current connection
sometime this weekend. All the current SSZ mailing lists will move with
the exeption of the Cypherpunks related ones and Club Inferno. These bring
me entirely too many subpeonas and visits from 'shady characters' for me
to want to share that privilige with others ;) The Austin Cypherpunks are
expected to be active in projects however (I'm still wanting to build a
radiation based diode RNG, versus a Geiger-Meuller tube). First I need to
get 'igor' (Perl based anon remailer/mail list manager) working and that
isn't really scheduled to even start until something like July (we've got
to finish the initial server farm first).
Stu is working on the physical meeting and we should have something worked
out in the next week or two. We hope to have the first meets the last of
Feb. or first week of March. We hope to have weekly meetings with topics
in a variety of areas. However, we are NOT primarily a support
organization, we are focused on projects and services. The Austin
Cypherpunks will continue with their traditional monthly 'social' meeting.
For more mundane project discussion one of the Open Groups meetings will
be more workable.
The 802.11b's are about 10 miles apart (~183 & ~48th
we'll be adding one in Leander in the near term as well) and will be
accessible only by Open Forge/Hangar 18 participants (to all those local
users groups that declined our invitation - your loss - we tried to be
more liberal and you said 'no'). The proposed site in Elgin was dropped
when the sponsor decided it wasn't worth his time. We are looking for any
potential participants in that area.

If you have access to a "Running Linux" 1st or 2nd ed., look in the
appendix under sites to obtain Linux in the 512 area code...:)
What I discovered is that Plan 9 is a distributed OS, therefore to use it
you need a distributed infrastructure. That implies several machines. I'd
suggest loading a I/O-Auth server and learn the basic sys admin (the first
thing you ALWAYS do with a OS after getting a good load). Then build a
file server, followed by at least two (2) process boxes.
Our current state is that we have the T1 in stalled and two 802.11b
wireless AP's in Austin, Tx. We are currently fighting name resolver
issues under SuSE 7.3, as soon as they are resolved in the next couple of
days we'll link the two sites together (ie ssz.com w/ mansion.org &
open-forge.org/com goes live). Once we have the firewall and routing
issues taken care of we'll be replacing our primary DNS machine with a
Plan 9 box (once we figure out how). The best target for a Plan 9 cluster
of services (ie a I/O/Auth/DNS server, a 80G file server, and at least two
process boxes is July). We stongly(!) invite others to put up resources
sooner. Once the resources are up we've got to figure out a way to control
access (probably a sign-up via webpage).
Hangar 18 (and Open Forge) is not the usual 'user group'. We are a
co-op. This means that if you want to play, you have to provide some sort
of service to grow the co-op.
Rule  No free loaders or lurkers. If you're not working on an active
project you're in the wrong place.
If you just want to munge system resources then you'll have to find a
current co-op member who is willing to give away access gratis. The Open
Forge group doesn't do that. This means that in order to get a reliable
connection to Open Forge through ssz.com, mansion.org, or
open-forge.org/com you'll need to have something to share with the
community. It could be a machine with 24*365 access (part-time isn't
acceptable for servers), program on projects, host a cluster of mail
lists (we're currently at 200+ when we go live). Users will of course be
able to access the 80G file server and a small (maybe 2-4) sub-set of our
planned process cluster. This small set of resources will be available for
anyone to use via Plan 9 (file and process) or Linux and other OS'es (NFS
to the file server only currently). The first time is free ;)
If you'd like more info:
Rule  In general we are NOT working with the Bell Labs organization or
any of their sub-groups or associates.
Consider it a core split of the development community from the get go.
They aren't interested in several of the aspects that Hangar 18 is focused
on and we don't really like their attitude (we do acknowledge their
technical skills and admire them for it). So outside of sharing code we
don't forsee a lot of interaction. Otherwise one of us would have to hurt
the other I suspect ;)
I'd suggest you also take a look at Unununium as well. Very cool
kernel-less design.
That sentence makes zero sense to me, who or what is a 'Maurice Bach'? A
books author? I prefer the O'Reilly sys-admin books for Unix but there
ain't such a beastie for Plan 9. The consequence is read the supplied dox
and peruse the source Luke...

Reply-To: 9fans
Hello 9fans,
Now I am considering about CGI environment of Web server.
Let A be a CGI program that is owned by user alice,
and assume the program needs to read from file B
that must be protected to the accesses from other users.
That is, the permission mode is required to be,
-r--r----- 16 alice alice  .... B
Then how can we design Web server on Plan9?
In case of UNIX, this problem may be solved using SETUID, or
more safely solved using CGI wrapper.
Plan9 does not have such an easy way for `none' to become `alice'.
Authentication must be required.
Public key cryptography may be applied.
Let the Web server start with server mode, then httpd can read  key that is in a file owned by bootes with 400 permission.
User alice encrypts her password using public key and puts it  In executing A, httpd decrypt her key and then become `alice'.
I am afraid this scheem gives too much right to httpd.
We need only a given CGI can read a given file.
Do you have oher solutions?

By Barak Jolish
Feb. 4, 2002 | Here's a tip for Treasury Department agents tracking
al-Qaida's finances: You might want to pay a visit to the volume discount
department at Dell Computer. Al-Qaida, it seems, has been an avid consumer
of computers over the last several years, and is especially fond of
laptops. It isn't hard to understand why. With his hectic, on-the-go
lifestyle, no self-respecting terrorist can function without a computer
that fits comfortably on an airplane tray table. Alleged "20th hijacker"
Zacarias Moussaoui, for instance, used his to research crop dusters, quite
possibly in preparation for a biological attack on a densely populated
American city. Ramsi Yousef used a laptop he accidentally left in a Manila
apartment to plan his extensive itinerary, which included assassinating the
pope in the Philippines, attacking an Israeli Embassy in Thailand, and
bombing the World Trade Center in 1993.
It's not surprising, then, that the seizure of computers has become a
primary goal for U.S. soldiers scouring Afghan caves and ambushing Taliban
and al-Qaida operatives. Ironically, though, winning possession of this
equipment on the battlefield may be the easy part; terrorists today have
the capacity to protect data with encryption schemes that not even
America's high-tech big guns can crack. The number of possible keys in the
new 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), for example, is 1 followed
by 77 zeros -- a figure comparable to the total number of atoms in the
Luckily, not all encryption is hopelessly secure. Ramsi Yousef was careless
in protecting the password to his encrypted files, giving the FBI
relatively easy access to their contents. It took the Wall Street Journal
only days to decrypt files on two Al-Qaida computers that used a weak
version of the Windows 2000 AES cipher in Afghanistan. The U.S. cannot,
however, count on such carelessness indefinitely.
But recent changes in U.S. policy have actually reduced restrictions on the
spread of sophisticated encryption. In January 2000, for instance, the
Clinton administration ruled that "retail products" that undergo a
one-time, 30-day government review can be exported to nearly all countries
(with the exception of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and
Syria) without any government licensing requirement. Revisions published
later that year relaxed even these limitations for products exported to the
15 nations of the European Union and several of their major trading
partners. The practical effect of these reforms has been that the
industrial-strength Windows 2000 128-bit High Encryption Pack is now freely
available over the Internet to anyone, including Hamburg residents such as
presumed Sept. 11 ringleader Mohammed Atta.
Since Sept. 11, some commentators and lawmakers have suggested that the
U.S. reverse itself once again, and redouble efforts to control encryption.
On the surface, this sentiment is understandable -- it is difficult to
argue against any moves that may prevent future terrorist attacks on the
scale of the WTC disaster. This position is, however, dead wrong.
Quite simply, the U.S. regime of strict encryption controls didn't make
sense before Sept. 11, and it doesn't make sense now. The starkest
illustration of this reasoning is the case study of Israel, which is
simultaneously a leader in encryption product exports and a major focus of
terrorist attacks.
Before President Clinton's 2000 reforms, proponents of encryption export
controls were besieged from all sides: on the left and right flanks privacy
advocates argued that strong encryption is vital to protecting individual
liberty against government intrusion. First Amendment devotees launched a
frontal attack in the courts, claiming that encryption code was essentially
speech. Most effective, however, was the carpet bombing of lobbyists and
campaign contributions from the software industry -- the Microsofts, IBMs
and Suns of the world -- who argued that export controls simply drove
customers seeking secure products to companies in other countries -- such
as Israel. These companies estimated their losses in billions of dollars,
and noted the costs to workers as well; even domestic companies were hiring
independent overseas software developers to create encryption products.
Though their agendas differed, the above parties were united in their
claims that the government's policy stood little chance of significantly
controlling criminal use of encryption. First, they noted that producing
encryption algorithms takes few resources beyond advanced mathematical
training. In fact, sometimes even these skills are not necessary; in early
1999 a 16-year-old Irish high school student named Sarah Flannery developed
a new data-encryption algorithm that was 22 times faster than the popular
RSA algorithm used in many business transactions today.
Second, reform advocates stressed that there is no practical way to keep
encryption within or without the confines of physical borders. For
instance, anyone can purchase a copy of the encryption program Crypto II on
the streets of Moscow for $5, and then e-mail it to a friend in New York.
Third, legal controls on encryption will bind only those who decide to
follow the law. Terrorists who are willing to fly a jet into the side of a
building will have no qualms about breaking laws against illegal
encryption. Finally, encryption advocates claim that government control
stifles development of the strong encryption we need to protect computer
networks from attacks by hackers and other criminals, and to secure our
systems for air traffic control, electrical distribution, financial markets
and telecommunications.
But hasn't Sept. 11 changed the equation? Americans have, after all, now
come to accept that they will have to compromise on issues like privacy or
economic growth in favor of increased security.
It is specifically in the aftermath of this trauma that where it becomes
instructive to look at the policy of Israel, a country defined by its
obsession with security. The Israeli predicament is essentially a starker
version of that of the U.S. On the one hand, Israel has faced six wars in
its first 50 years, and confronts terrorist shootings and suicide bombings
virtually every week. Both the Israeli army and the FBI have confirmed that
Hamas and other Islamic militants regularly use the Internet to transmit
encrypted instructions for terrorist attacks -- including maps,
photographs, directions, codes and technical details about how to use
bombs. On the other hand, Israel's economy is among the most reliant in the
world on high technology exports. In fact, the share of Israel's
information technology exports as a percentage of services exports is
surpassed only by Japan. All of this has helped earn a country with few
natural resources other than potash a per capita GDP of $17,500 -- higher
than that of several members of the European Union.
In this context it is significant that in 1998 Israel, too, revised its
rather draconian encryption laws, granting regulators a great deal of
flexibility to permit the export of strong encryption products -- including
a "free means" category for which all license requirements are waived.
These changes were prefaced by a government report that noted the futility
of limiting "the use of means that can be freely obtained from many public
sources," and said that the law should permit Israeli companies to develop
and export "competitive products that can be marketed in most of the
world's countries as off-the-shelf products." In fact, even before the 1998
liberalization, flexible enforcement had allowed Israeli companies such as
Checkpoint Software to dominate the network security field.
The lesson from the Israelis is not how to control terror -- they don't
seem to have better answers than anyone else -- but rather how to live with
it and continue to function with as little social and economic disruption
as possible. If, as President Bush tells us, we're in this war for the long
haul, we simply cannot afford to sap our economic strength to prop up the
fantasy that we can control the actions of terrorists by fiat. There are
some battles we just shouldn't fight.

Where do you get the issue of money being involved? Bail comes BEFORE any
Sending somebody to jail for life for any crime where harm to a person

There is the issue that such 3 strike laws violate some of the basic ideas
of justice and fairness. When a person finishes their term as a
consequence for a crime they have paid their dues. It is even. Coming back
later and trying to hold that against them is simply unconstitutional.
You can't throw somebody in jail for being thrown in jail before and that
is ALL that three strike laws do. Other than increase the cost of the
legal system to the rest of the community.

LIGHT BENDS MAGNET.  Previously, directed light has
produced a magnetic response in metallic materials but physicists
at Ohio State are now the first to produce light-induced magnetization in an organic material.  The material,
tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), was exposed to blue light which
caused the magnetization to increase by as much as 50%.  The new
magnetism could then be undone by green light. The researchers

A mass murder is traveling around the country Anarchia. He is very

How would a CACL based society handle this sort of situation? How would
even the existance of the single murderer be discovered since there is no
heirarchy in which to share and manage criminal investigations. After all
the 'law enforcement' is nothing more than a bunch of loosely organized,

I think there _are_ good business reasons for them not wanting the users to
generate the keys all by themselves. Weak keys, and subsequent compromises, may
give the CA really bad press and resulting loss of reputation (and this business is built on reputation anyway). So: there are good reasons not to
let the CA generate the private key, but also good reasons to not let the user
generate the keys all by himself. So the question is: are there key generation protocols for mutually distrustful
parties, that would give the CA the assurance that the key is generated using
some good randomness (coming from the CA) and would give the user the guarantee
that his private key is truly private. Also, the CA should be able to verify
later that the random data he supplied was actually used, but this should not
give him (too much) advantage to find the private key.
A smartcard based system might be useful here (as suggested by other
subscribers here). But a software only solution is preferred because it would
maker the application area much broader (because the user does not have to be
supplied with special hardware - terminals + smartcards).

You're welcome to your opinion, when you get your node up knock yourself
out. I'll even give you a feed off the backbone.
The reality is that no harm has come to you or any other participant in
this list from the traffic (irrespective of the content). Claiming that
this somehow gives you the right of self-defence is simply bullshit.
Having ones feeling hurt or being exposed to a concept or discussion not
of your interest justifies nothing more than your not participating.
You're a self-absorbed, self-important tyro who is only interested in
their personal goals and desires.
Fuck off and die.
ps Anyone who claims that CACL won't lead to traditional 'anarchy' only
   has to look at comment  above for a clear and present example of why
   CACL approaches to human psychology will never work.

mattd posts drivel, delete it. Jei posts some interesting things.  Either

If a distributed systems is to work then it must deal with these sorts of
issues without coercive violence (or isnt' that the CACL canon anymore)?
This is a PERFECT example of why CACL theology is full of crap, it is
obviously self-defeating and not executable under human psychology for the
simple reason that people, ALL PEOPLE, want to spend their time telling
other people what to do so THEY don't have to do anything.
Grow up and quit being a wimp.

Not yours and not the users of the archive (there only decision is it
relevant to their personal goals).
Which is relevant how? Take my  pointers for example. I get plenty of

a consequence (and it was relevant to cpunks topics to boot). I also
intentionaly use the archives as a storage so if I, or anyone else, can
get back to them easily. It's that community thing. If you are really that
concerned, as an archivist versus a CACL whiner, about the use of
resources then as the owner/operator you are free to filter as you see
You're myopic.
Bullshit. Just plain and simple. A mailing list exists for the use and
utility of its operators and subscribersk, AT THAT TIME. Not previous
mailing lists, or social expectations writ large qualify as a binding
precedence. Talk about somebody in a rut.
As Jefferson said, the world belonds to the living not the dead.
It's not sociopathic in any manner, opportunistic perhaps. In addition
since there is no harm done to anyone it's a little hard to understand
CACL complaints on these sorts of topics.
Just goes to demonstrate my claim that CACL is really socialist at heart
wanting everyone to do the same thing so a small group can benefit.

To hear anarchist/socialists refer to all NGOs as tools of capitalism is
interesting indeed especially in the context of the very specific examples given
below...  My opinion is that you can find examples of rotten policies on a
global scale for anything.  Pick your poison.  The ENDA example below being a
prime case along w/ the ATTAC group policies in light of a few (possibly
necessary diplomatic) public words from a spokesperson being another.  Again the
context of the original words is key and to understand it is beyond most of our
non-political careers...  and available atoms in the universe.
In short the below article may point out valid negative points about specific
NGOs and
such negative things as traditional capital based influences on the WSF-- is
truly pure these days-- but in my opinion it all paints with too broad a brush.
NGOs are in essence social groupings through the globe within existing societies
recognized and sheltered within the existing structures and in most cases there
is quite a bit of latitude- within the context of the applicable laws- on how
such a group is constituted and what it is permitted to do.  And in most cases
their is if not structure at least an agreement on an interface that allows some
level of accountability into that organization.
On another note: one of the issues we've seen recently that is not addressed
well by the militant anarchist/socialist groups is the lack of transparency
within their ranks.  Instead of working to gain more transparency in the groups
that they assemble against (allow for open criticisms and hopefully
amelioration/remediation/explanation such as in the cases below) they have a
strong tendency to internally hold their policies and gatherings in secret- in
fear of infiltration and subterfusion.  Granted if you form a spokescouncil and
agree to membership rules you're allowed fairly deep penetration of
externally hidden strategies.  But...
I fear I paint w/ a broad brush myself when I say that it sounds like a new
religion to me... ;-)  Then again the anarchist goal is the destruction of all
traditional authority structures and that is not predicated w/ any level of
transparency, cooperation, or in some cases accountability.  Maybe I'm still
from influences/shocks of "cult of personalities" during recent events... ;-)
How close to the absolute left is the absolute right.  Yeehaw!

<<<<< snip std forward disclaimer - g >>>>>
[ As many people know, many Brazilian anarchists are organizing events
parallel to the official World Social Forum, as part of their critique of
the WSF-process. Many of these people are very sympathetic to the PGA
network, if not actively involved. The Brazilian trade unionists below
are actually boycotting the WSF, or at least not attending the major
events.  Their critique below is very instructive, and represents, I
think, a clear break from reformist efforts like the Hemispheric Social
Alliance (which is involved with the WSF-process). Just some food for
thought ... J]
Open Letter to the Trade Unionists and Activists Participating in the
World Social Forum 2002 in Porto Alegre, Brazil:
Is it possible to put a human face on globalization and war?
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
  We, the undersigned Brazilian trade unionists, want to open a dialogue
with you. We are living through a terrible situation the world over. The
U.S. government, under the cover of the United Nations, is using the
heinous terrorist attacks of September 11 to intensify a political agenda
of "full-scale, protracted war" -- as Bush himself has stated. It is a war
that started with the bombing of Afghanistan and is far from over.
  In neighboring Argentina, the people -- after years of governments that
had submitted to the dictates of the IMF and applied the politics of
privatization, destruction of workers' rights, and bleeding the nation to
pay back the foreign debt -- took to the streets and threw out the
"center-left" government of Fernando De la Rua. They made it clear they
wanted an end to policies that had plunged millions of Argentineans into
misery and hunger -- all in the name of "modernization," the "exigencies
of globalization," the "criteria" of the Mercosul regional "free trade"
pact, and the preparation of the country for the FTAA!
  In this new situation, the "powers that dominate the world" -- that is,
the multinationals; the financial speculators; the international financial
institutions such as the WTO, World Bank and IMF; and all the governments
in their service -- have declared an economic and political war against
the workers, against their organizations, and against the peoples. Their
aim is to use the tragic events of September 11th to roll back all the
rights and conquests wrested through bitter struggle by working and
oppressed peoples. Their aim is to destroy any and all barriers to their
plunder of natural resources and their unbridled quest for profit and
  The struggles of resistance against these scorched-earth policies cry
out for the unity of working people the world over -- from North to South
and from East to West. It requires the united struggle of oppressed and
exploited peoples to stop this offensive of war and destruction, which is
leading the world to the brink of barbarism. Only through such united
struggle in defense of the rights and gains of working people will it be
possible to chart a way forward for the future of humanity.
  For our part, we are certain that this quest for unity in action to
defend and advance the rights of working people is what has prompted
thousands of unionists and activists from across the globe to participate
in the second World Social Forum (WSF) in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
  But does the reality of the WSF correspond to this expectation? Does the
WSF offer a way forward for this struggle? We want to raise some questions
here about the WSF and invite you, our bothers and sisters, to draw your
own conclusions.
  The Trap of Civil Society
  The WSF has presented itself, since its inception, as a forum for "civil
society." The very concept of "civil society," which is so popular of
late, erases the borders between social classes that exist in society.
How, for example, is it possible to include in the same category of "civil
society" both the exploited and the exploiters, the bosses and workers,
the oppressors and oppressed -- not to mention the churches, NGOs, and
government and UN representatives?
  The organizing committee of the WSF in Brazil includes organizations
such as the Brazilian Association of Employers for the Citizens (CIVES)
and the Brazilian Association of NGOs (ABONG). They are joined in the
committee by other entities, which, to be sure, are connected to the
struggles of the exploited and oppressed -- such as the CUT [Unified Workers
 Federation] and the MST [Movement of Landless Peasants]. Is this
organizing committee itself not an expression of the politics of "civil
society" -- that is, of the attempt to group together in the same camp
interests that are in fact contradictory and diametrically opposed?
  Let's take the example of the campaign in defense of workers' rights
contained in the Brazilian Labor Code which we in the Brazilian trade
union movement are now carrying out. The CUT has issued a call to prepare
a General Strike in March 2002 to prevent the approval of PL 4583 by
Minister Dornelles. It is clear that the CUT is determined to carry forth
with this strike call should the situation require it.
  What do the so-called "progressive bosses" think of these workers'
rights?  What do the NGOs -- which both practice and promote
"volunteerism" and other forms of precarious and unregulated labor --
think about these workers' rights? Don't all the jobs "created" by the
NGOs, in fact, replace jobs in the public enterprises and services, in
line with the policies implemented by [Brazilian President] Fernando
Henrique Cardoso at the behest of the IMF?
  The politics of "civil society" are today officially the politics of the
World Bank. What is the content of these politics? Judge for yourself. The
World Bank's World Development Report 2000/2001 puts it this way:
  "It is appropriate for financial institutions to use their means ... to
develop an open and regular dialogue with the organizations of civil
society, in particular those that represent the poor. ...Social
fragmentation can be mitigated by bringing groups together in formal and
informal forums and channelling their energies into political processes
instead of open conflict."
  Could it be a coincidence that among the funding sources of the WSF one
can find the Ford Foundation -- or that the World Bank's website promotes
the Porto Alegre Forum?
  What is the role of NGOs?
  Hundreds, if not thousands, of NGOs will be participating in the World
Economic Forum of Davos (to be held this year in New York) as well as in
the WSF in Porto Alegre. What is the role that those who control the
commanding heights of the global economy attribute to the NGOs?
  In the official Word Bank document titled "The World Bank and Civil
Society" (September 2000), one can read the following: "[M]ore than 70% of
the projects supported by the World Bank that were approved in 1999
involved non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society in some
  There is a popular proverb that states, "He who pays the piper calls the
tune." The World Bank, as we know, is part of the holy trinity of
capitalist globalization, alongside the IMF and the WTO. Could it be that
these institutions are "neutral" and that they do not express the
interests of global capitalism? Let us look at this one concrete example:
The International Commission of the WSF met in Dacar, the capital of
Senegal, on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 2001. ENDA-3rd World, which is an NGO that has
been actively building the WSF across Africa, hosted and organized this
WSF planning meeting. What are the politics of ENDA?
  According to its own documents, ENDA believes that "to prohibit child
labor is to deprive children, as well as their families, of an important
means of subsistence." ENDA affirms that "it is necessary to take into
account the socio-economic reality and, therefore, to fight for the rights
of child laborers."
  This stance by ENDA is in open contradiction to the positions of the CUT
and the international labor movement -- all of which call for the
abolition of child labor and mandatory education through age 15 of all
children. The place for children is in school! But not only does ENDA
advocate child labor, it is participating directly in the privatization of
the public water system, constructing wells and cisterns and charging the
users a fee for providing the water. (source: "ENDA: Water and Urban Poverty")
  What about the Tobin Tax and ATTAC?
  In the name of James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics and
fervent advocate of corporate "free trade," an Association for the
Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Assistance to Citizens (ATTAC)
was created -- first in France (1998) and then on an international scale.
Among its goals is the establishment of a Tobin Tax, which would create a
tax of between 0.05 percent and 0.1 percent on international financial
transactions. The money collected would serve to create an "international
fund" to help "development and the struggle against poverty."
  As is widely known, ATTAC is today one of the main founders and
organizers of the WSF of Porto Alegre. The Tobin Tax, for its part, has
won the  support of people as "prominent" as the multi-billionaire and
speculator George Soros, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
and others.
  Now, if a tax existed to finance an international "fund" to aid the
poor,  one would think that the greater the financial speculation, the
better --  because such a "fund" would have more resources. This
rationale is not far-fetched.
  Be that as it may, along with the Tobin Tax, ATTAC today is dedicated to
other ventures as well. It proposes to "change the world" under the slogan
"another world is possible" through "better control over globalization."
But is it possible to change the world without questioning the fundamental
relations of production -- without challenging the private ownership of
the major means of production? Is another world possible with a minimal
Tobin Tax helping to "control globalization"?
  Bernard Cassen, president of ATTAC-France and director of Le Monde
Diplomatique, a newspaper controlled by the enterprise group of the daily
Le Monde, declared at the founding congress of ATTAC-Germany (Oct, 19-21,
2001) that, "President Bush has taken steps in the direction of ATTAC's
proposals since September 11, 2001. It is clear that we still have a long
ways to go. But it is necessary to note that ... Mr. Bush is now against
tax shelters. We register this fact. Bush has come closer to our positions
concerning the role of the state, investing US$120 billion in the economy.
... He has embraced our position on the cancellation of the debt, though
he is doing this for his own reasons. The U.S., for example, has just
cancelled Pakistan's debt, which proves that it is possible to cancel the
  Bush has just launched one of the largest-scale offensives against
working people ever, including the massive bombing of Afghanistan -- and
yet,  according to the president of ATTAC-France, Bush is moving closer to
the positions of ATTAC. This is very interesting.
  "A world without war is possible"
  Under this title, a special session of the World Social Forum will be
devoted to a "world without war." According to the proposal from the
organizers, this session "seeks to bring social and/or institutional
representatives of the regions where wars are taking place together with
Nobel Peace Prize recipients in a joint effort to reflect on the nature of
wars and to identify the possibilities of elaborating peace plans." The
following "regions" will be discussed: Palestine, Kashmir, the Basque
Country, Colombia and Chiapas. Curiously, the bombing of Afghanistan will
not be part of the agenda. How is it possible for the "all-out and
protracted" war launched by Bush -- today in Afghanistan and tomorrow
possibly in Iraq or Somalia -- not to be part of the discussion under this
  Palestine -- which currently faces a dramatic situation, with the State
of Israel attacking on all fronts in open war -- will be discussed, with
the objective of "elaborating a peace plan." But what is origin of the
current situation in Palestine? It is the Oslo Accords, sponsored by the
United States (under Clinton) and then legitimized by the UN as a "peace
plan."  These accords created a pseudo-Palestinian "state" (the
Palestinian Authority, whose headquarters are now being bombed), which was
but an  conglomeration of miniscule so-called Palestinian territories
surrounded by the State of Israel.
  Speaking of "Nobel Peace Prizes," it was the Oslo Accords that garnered
that prize for Yasir Arafat and for the Israeli chief of state at that
time: Shimon Peres. As a matter of fact, the Secretary General of the UN,
Kofi Annan, has also been graced with the Nobel Peace Prize, perhaps in
recognition for the role that the UN played in perpetrating the genocide
in Rwanda -- or was it for the embargo that the UN has imposed on Iraq, or
better yet for the cover provided by the UN to the NATO bombers in
  "Participatory democracy" and the "participatory budget"
  The World Bank has just created an international department charged with
overseeing the implementation of "participatory democracy" in 26
countries. It has also translated, published and distributed the book "The
Participatory Budget: The Experience of Porto Alegre," written by Tarso
Genro [former mayor of Porto Alegre] and Ubirata de Souza. Is this simply
disinterested propaganda of the World Bank? Or, on the contrary, do the
"participatory democracy and "participatory budget" processes not, in
fact, embody the above-cited strategy of "channeling energies" to avoid
"open conflict"?
  All the documents which came out of the first WSF of Porto Alegre
discuss the "model" experiences of "participatory democracy" that have
existed in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. The Second WSF continues on
the same line. Among the list of WSF workshops there is one titled "World
  Participatory Budget" (nothing more nor less!), organized by the
Governor of Rio Grande do Sul "in participation with the citizens' movements."
  But how does the "participatory budget" function in reality? In the
unsuspecting voice of its coordinator in the city of Sao Paulo, it is
meant to be a "filter for popular demands"!
  Only one small portion of the municipal budgets -- in the case of Porto
Alegre the sum amounts to 17% -- is earmarked for discussion and
allocation by the assemblies of representatives of popular organizations
  (the council of the "participatory budget"). These assemblies define how
  the priorities should be set for the disbursement of these limited
funds.  (The bulk of municipal budget monies are untouchable, as they have
been earmarked to pay back the foreign debt and other expenses.) As
resources are limited, there is constant in-fighting among activist
groups over how the priorities should be set. The "participatory budget"
councilors are forced to choose which they prefer: the creation of a
school or a health clinic, pavement of the roads, or childcare centers,
etc. This is how the responsibility for NOT meeting the demands of the
population is shifted ... onto the backs of the participants in the
"participatory budget" themselves!
  Now, who participates in the "participatory budgets"? The answer is
"civil society." In the case of a "participatory budget" assembly in the
municipality of Camacua, a businessperson sent "his" representatives as
delegates and won close to 70% of the votes to prioritize the pavement of
a road -- to the detriment of all the other demands!
  Is this, as its supporters claim, "an innovative form of democracy"? Or,
on the contrary, isn't it a trap that seeks to co-opt the popular
movements and associations into the implementation of the city
government's austerity plans, thereby making them responsible for the
"choices" that inevitably do untold harm to the other popular movements
and associations?
  And what conception of society lies behind this "participatory budget"?
It is that of a society without conflicts, without contradictions, based
on "consensus among equals." But is this not the inverse of democracy,
which demands the recognition that contradictory interests exist in
society, as well as the recognition of the right of the exploited and
oppressed to independent organization in the face of the state and the
  What would be, for example, the participation of a union of public
service workers in the "participatory budget"? There are no lack of voices
that say that unions "should learn to function in labor-management
cooperation committees" and therefore should enter in such "participatory"
forums. It is reasonable to expect that the union delegate would seek
improvements in wages and conditions as a priority. But the association of
homeowners may want light in their neighborhood. Instead of directing
their demands for public power and mobilizing to achieve them through
collective action, they will be played against each other in the
assemblies of the "participatory budget." Many of you have participated in
such assemblies.  Is what we are saying not the complete truth?
  Brothers and sisters:
  We, the undersigned unionists, will participate in the Trade Union and
Popular Assembly which the CUT has called in Porto Alegre on February 1st
to discuss and prepare the General Strike next March. But we will not
participate in the panels, workshops and official sessions of the World
Social Forum.
  We will not be there because we are convinced that the defense of the
organizations that workers have created to fight against capitalist
exploitation is contradictory with the politics of "civil society" --
which dissolve the borders of social class. It is contradictory, moreover,
with the politics of "giving a human face to globalization" -- which, as
we know, is not a phenomenon of nature, but rather the product of global
capitalism. "Globalization" by definition necessitates the destruction of
our workplaces, our jobs and our rights. Capitalist globalization has
destroyed nations, democracy, and the sovereignty of the poor. It cannot
be "humanized."
  We, who affirm the need to defend the trade unions as instruments of
working class struggle, deny any legitimacy or authority to the NGOs to
speak in the name of the exploited and oppressed. We do not claim to be
the sole possessors of the truth. We simply want to put forward our point
of view -- which is part of the democratic process. We respectfully submit
these views for the consideration of all our brothers and sisters in
  You can count on us as fighters in the struggle against war and
exploitation; in defense of social and labor rights, against deregulation;
in defense of trade union independence and democracy! You can count on us
in the struggle against the FTAA, and for the withdrawal of Brazil from
the negotiations to implement it! You can count on us in the struggle
against privatization and in defense of public services! You can count on
us in the preparation of the General Strike to stop the destruction of our
labor rights and to impose a defeat on the governments of FHC -IMF!

    Constitutional Convention would be of any real positive value in
    todays political, military, and business environment. So how?
    My answer is to create a new style of political group. The group
    would exist in each state with a central group in the capital,
    ancillary groups in other communities as needed. They would be
    involved in state and local elections to promote specific amendments
    to the Constitution. The specific goal being to get elected
    officials who see the amendments in a positive light. These
    groups would take their direction from a national group who
    acted within the confines of specific 'party platforms'. The
    ultimate goal would be to elect state legislators and executives
    who would be inclined to ratify a proposed amendment. Such an
    amendment would go into effect with no federal intervention.
    In other words, if a proposed amendment were to be on the
    necessary number of state legislators calendars at the same
    time. And the vote could be influenced in a particular way
    the Amendment would go into full force. At no stage of this
    process there be federal oversight or review.

Nobody said it was a panacea, that's why we have a constitution and bill
of rights. Democracy, at least constitutional ones, recognize that people
don't play fair, in particular if they are in the majority. Something CACL
philosophy has no clue on.
Like a football game or changing a babies diaper are entities I suppose.
A business is nothing more than an activity that people engage in. Take
the poeple away and you have nothing.
As individuals, yes. However, they do not have the right to gang up and
use economics in order to give increased weight to their vote. It's that
equal representation thingy...
No, donations should NEVER come from a business, they have zero
representation in a democracy. Money is NOT a measure of value in a
democracy, it is a means to enable that democracy and for INDIVIDUALS to
pursue happiness.
I never claimed that. In fact I claim exactly the opposite. That business
interests DO influence our government in a negative way.
Not if they're buying undue influence it isn't, even you agreed to that.
Which pretty much blows your justification for allowing businesses to
Repeat, a republic is a representative democracy.
I NEVER said 'shunning' shouldn't be allowed on the individual basis (I
don't like you and would shun you) but there is no place for a democratic
socity to shun anyone (whether they be black, poor, or women for example).
A society, at least the American democarcy we live in, is built upon the
concept of us working together in order to defend ourselves. The ONLY way
to do that is to recognize that all people are created equal and that in
order to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness people must be
provided with the basics of sustenance if they are unable to do it
themselves. This does NOT mean they do not accrue a contra coup
responsibility. Charity is not endless. However, if you don't provide
these basics then you create an environment that will lead to your own
destruction. There is a big difference between providing legal, medical,
and basic life sustenance through civil mechanisms and trying to set
everyone up in a mansion. You seem to miss the distinction.
I said that business should not have rules about behaviour UNLESS it can
be shown that behaviour impacts the business. The owners of that business
have a right to protect their pursuit of happiness, they don't have a
right to take their personal philosophy or beliefs and use the business to
'punish' others who hold different beliefs. There is no place for 'freedom
for me but not for thee' in a democracy.
No, stating openly that CACL philosphy has a fundamental flaw in its
concept of self defence and property rights. It's why we have that clause
in the Constitution about recompensation for private goods taken for
public use.
Again, an example of your poor grasp of private property.
Actually it does. See 9th and 10th. At no place does the Constitution
state that the acts of people should be interpreted as people. It ONLY
recognizes people as having rights. At no point do they indicate that the
legislature or other parts or the government should be responsible to
business interests. It simply sais the government should regulate them. A
major difference you seem to completely miss.
I'd go on but I have more productive work to do that respond to this

But unlike all other forms of government, democracy does not even
(strictly) recognize the rights of business (which ARE NOT people and DO
NOT have rights) have input into government. Much of this was changed
after the Civil War, for example the corporation law of 1870.
Playing word games now are we...some problems are insoluble (re Arrows
Impossibility Theorem).
Actually democracy is MUCH more than this. I suggest you re-read the first
two para's of the DoI for an example. For example, in a constitutional
democracy the rights of the minority are protected from the majority. It
happens to be the ONLY form of government that can make this claim.
A republic is a democracy, a representative democracy to be EXACT. Our
form of republic is a constitutional one (you don't need a constitution to
have a republic).
Muddy thinking on your part (and you're not alone so there is some solace
for you - no hope though).
I never said democracy was a silver bullet. I DID say (not in those exact
words but the intent is the same) there are NO silver bullets. Utopias
will always run afoul of the three laws of thermodynamics.
To vote on something you first have to have a right. You dont' have the
right to vote on whether anyone can post here. Your views are really
irrelevant to the issue. To be able to vote on whether somebody can post
here you must first have property rights to 'here'. Since it isn't a
public service or property, and you don't run a node, you're shit out of
luck junior.
This however does exemplify your lack of respect (well exhibited I might
add) for private property. You're really a socialist because you want it
to be reduced to the most commen level.
Why should I? You're so far out in left field your funny.
As any other form of government can. If people don't want to do it, it
won't happen.
Re CCCP.
Democracy (at least the American kind) does offer a solution, again in the
first two para's of the DoI.

best form of government available (utopias are impossible).
All other forms of government require everyone to fit into a single mold
of behaviour. Only democracy represents a priori recognition of the unique
views and needs of the individual. Further socialism, fascism, and anarchy
offer only a single solution to all problems. Democracy offers a plethora
of solutions.

Where's the smart money?
Feb 7th 2002
Money of the future may almost literally talk
AMERICAN banknotes bear the motto "In God we trust". A humorous extension
to this phrase-ascribed, unofficially, to the National Security Agency-is
"All Others, we monitor". That joke, though, may soon pale into reality,
for such a phrase might well be a suitable slogan for the cash of the
Radio-frequency identification tags (RFIDs) are widgets that are used all
over the world for granting access to secure areas. They are also used to
track anything from books to pallets to cattle to Prada handbags. Their
advantage is that each tag (and therefore each object) can be identified
uniquely. That makes them different from, say, bar codes, which merely
identify classes of object. Also unlike bar codes, RFIDS can be read
remotely without having to be in the line of sight of the reader. In recent
years, their manufacturers have been drooling over the possibility of
tagging banknotes. The advantages envisaged are a combination of
authentication, anti-counterfeiting and tracking.
In the money
The guts of a typical RFID tag are a microchip and an antenna (often a coil
of wire). These may be sandwiched inside an encapsulating plastic. There is
no battery. When a tag is "interrogated" by a reading machine operating at
the right radio frequency, the antenna picks up a small amount of
electromagnetic energy that it uses to power the chip. The tag then
broadcasts data in the chip back to the reader.
A new generation of RFID tags produced by companies such as Texas
Instruments in America, Hitachi in Japan and Infineon Technologies in
Germany, has broken through barriers of size (less than 1mm across and
12mm thick), cost, flexibility and durability, to a point where such tags
can be embedded inside sheets of paper, such as banknotes.
The distance from which tagged banknotes could be read would depend on the
exact specifications of the chips that were used. It would probably be
somewhere between 10cm and a metre. One form of the technology can read 30
notes a second, although the tags have to be separated from each other by a
distance of at least 2cm to reduce interference. Initially, therefore,
bundles of notes could not be read; but notes being issued from cash
machines, or passing from customers to tills, could.
The technology remains relatively expensive (20-30 cents a chip), and there
is still work to be done hammering out what people want in the way of
security standards, durability and the amount of information that can be
stored. But Infineon says that these problems could be ironed out within 30
months, and possibly much faster than that. Critics sound a warning,
however, that long delays are likely in reaching an international agreement
on a cryptographic security standard.
One bank, at least, seems interested in the idea. Late last year,
Electronic Engineering Times reported that the European Central Bank (ECB)
was working with "technology partners" to embed the tags into euro notes by
2005-as a means of foiling counterfeiters. The ECB will only say of the
project, "we don't want to talk about this." Nevertheless, two chip
manufacturers, Philips and Infineon, admit to having signed confidentiality
agreements with some firms in the industry. Hitachi says it has been
discussing the issue with European banknote makers.
Obviously, such tags would make counterfeiters' lives far more difficult.
But according to De La Rue, a British firm that is one of the world's
leading "security" printers and paper makers, the ECB is already aware of
many new anti-counterfeiting technologies that would be just as robust as,
and less expensive than, RFID. If this is the case, the additional benefits
of RFID banknotes-such as the greater ease with which cash could be
tracked-are the likeliest explanation for why the technology is now
attracting serious consideration.
RFID-tagged notes mean that it would be possible to gather "real-time"
inventories of notes within banks. And, if cash registers were equipped
with authorised readers (tags can also interrogate reading machines to
establish a reader's "authority" to ask particular questions), details of
the transaction and the notes involved could be collated in a central
Accurate knowledge, and monitoring, of the population of banknotes could be
a powerful tool. The mining of data on how different banknotes move through
the economy would make it easy to spot suspicious transactions-for example,
a large deposit of notes that had been out of circulation for a long time.
There are further possibilities. Known notes could be slipped into the
"informal" economy by law-enforcement agencies that wanted to find out
where they turned up. Kidnappers could no longer insist on unmarked bills,
for there would be no such things. Even the theft of cash would become a
much trickier affair.
Clearly, the technology would have huge privacy implications. On the one
hand, customers of illicit and semi-licit goods and services, such as
recreational drugs and prostitution, would risk losing their anonymity
unless they were careful. On the other, ham-fisted policing might implicate
the innocent in transactions to which they had not been a party, merely
because they once handled suspect notes.
Nevertheless, it is likely that the threat of terrorism and organised
crime, and the precedent of existing methods for tracking money, will be
strong counter-arguments in favour of tracking technology. The relatively
high cost of the tags has led to speculation that they would be practical
only in high-value notes-in the case of the ECB, euro200 and euro500. But
it is just such notes that are of concern to agencies such as Britain's
National Criminal Intelligence Service, which warns that these new
denominations make it easier to move large amounts of currency discreetly
(and possibly illegally) around the world. The global reach of the euro, a
currency that is policed by a fragmented group of authorities, highlights
weaknesses that RFID technology may be well-placed to rectify. For
criminals, money may no longer talk. Instead, it may squeal.

Not quite accurate. What crossing the river did was indicate his desire to
break the Triumvirate with Pompey (Crassus being killed at the battle of
Carrhea). He was off fighting in Gaul when Pompey was elected sole Consul
in 52BC. In 51BC he conquered Gaul and wrote De Bello Gallico (another
western book on warfare). The Senate ordered him to give up his command
and he crossed the river. Pompey fled to Greece. Caesar (not Ceasar) defeats Pompey at Pharsalia in Greece. His real bitch was not to take over
Rome or start a civil war, but to retain his command of his legions.
Unfortunately with the political climate, it was all or nothing.

How so? Representative democracy mediated by a constitution is the most
efficient form of democracy (which is the most efficient form of
government). It describes the duties of the government, the
responsibilities of the agents/representatives, limits the gross authority
of the masses to something less than absolute. Which is critical for any
democracy - something CACL philosophy doesn't do at all since it allows
economic coersion to exist without limit. And protects the individual from

can't claim to work unless people use it (and people don't, which speaks
for itself).
The fact is that the net will not decrease the amount of time and effort
spent on negotiations and working private deals. It may make the
interchange faster but the vast majority of time is spent in discussion,
decision, and execution. None of these are ameniable to the net. They
happen at 'people time' and unless you know a way of jacking up your
nervous system that time frame won't change.

On Saturday, February 16, 2002, at 09:17  AM, georgemw You still are. If Alice encrypts to Bob's public key, and then sends the encrypted message or leaves it on her disk, whatever, then the message is not readable by anyone who does not have Bob's _private_ key.
By contrast, use of a old-fashioned secret key means that anyone who saw Bob giving the secret key to Alice (wiretappers, for example) now has access to all communications using that secret key.
This was all covered in the mid-70s in the seminal Diffie and Hellman papers on how parties who have never met may nevertheless communicate securely without physically exchanging a key. (Interstellar communication being one of the examples...)
There are interesting issues, to be sure, such as man-in-the-middle attacks (e.g., the Rigelians one things one is communicating with are actually Zeta Reticulans who inserted themselves into the link.).
So public key systems have many elegant aspects that go well beyond the "universal phonebook" model.
I agree with the earlier poster (forgotten who) who said that publishing public keys is not at all necessary, or even recommended. I can think of so many reasons why this is so that I didn't even think it was important to voice my support for his or her point.
You'd rather swap secret keys?
Or is your claim that having your name, call it "Blacknet," in a registry means something? Absent a whole infrastructure of biometrics, of certificate authorities, etc., key registries are flawed.
The spoofing or MITM sorts of attacks are never easily solved, anyway.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 582  March 26, 2002   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein,
and James Riordon
MICRO-TESLA MRI was reported at last week's APS March
meeting in Indianapolis by Robert McDermott, a member of John
Clarke's group at UC Berkeley.  The principle behind MRI is
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a process in which a magnetic
field (often a strong one), is used to orient atomic nuclei in space
while a burst of radio waves explores the nuclear energy levels by
charting the frequencies at which energy is absorbed resonantly. In
addition to establishing chemical identity NMR can also be turned
into an imaging method by carefully watching the timing and the
location of the re-emitted radio waves.  A tumor, say, will have a
slightly different water density (as revealed, in this case, by the
presence of protons in the NMR survey) from surrounding healthy
tissue.  Computer processing and contrast enhancement will
disclose the tumor's position to a trained observer. Generally large
magnets are required to produce sharp NMR images, and the
development of a low-field version would benefit medical and
scientific studies.  McDermott reported an experiment in which an
array of four columns of fluid were imaged with a field of 10
micro-Tesla over the period of several hours.  (See also
McDermott et al., Science 22 March 2002.)
    Also at the APS meeting,  Mark Haacke of the MRI Institute for
Biomedical Imaging in St. Louis (314-961-9105,
nmrimaging discussed a new MRI technique called
susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).  The technique measures
differences among brain tissue in its magnetic susceptibility,
essentially its magnetic response to the applied magnetic field of
the MRI machine.  Yielding unique information from veins and
blood products, SWI has already provided more sharply detailed
MRI images of blood vessels in the brain than previously possible
and the presence of small hemorrhages in heretofore unavailable
detail.  SWI can potentially detect angiogenesis, the growth of
blood vessels caused by cancer, and may improve diagnosis of
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, through its ability to monitor
iron deposits in the brain.
ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL LIVING
[SSZ: Text deleted]
ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY YIELDS 3D PROTEIN
STRUCTURE.  Despite its name, atomic force microscopy (AFM)
does not produce atomic-resolution images of proteins or other
large molecules.  When imaging macromolecules, a large region,
about 100 square nanometers, of the AFM tip makes contact with
the molecule.  This region is comparable in size to the entire
molecule and makes the tip a blunt probe by atomic standards.  To
extract more detailed information from AFM images of
macromolecules, one can directly subtract the effects of the tip but
the results are often inaccurate.  At the March APS Meeting,
Steven Eppell and Brian Todd of Case Western Reserve University
(216-368-4067, sje presented a new technique for
obtaining submolecular information about proteins.  Investigating
aggrecan, a cartilage protein important in osteoarthritis, the
researchers used a technique that combined AFM with genome
information and transmission electron microscopy data.  All of the
data were integrated by using a sophisticated image processing
technique to provide a best guess at the 3D structure.  The resulting
refined structure yielded new information on the molecule,
showing distinct locations of kinks as well as regions of
mechanical flexibility.  The researchers hope to combine their
results with AFM-measured force fields around cartilage proteins
to link the biological and mechanical properties of cartilage with
its molecular structure.  This approach has the potential to provide
information on molecular-scale mechanisms for arthritis and lead
to intelligent drug design and other interventions to prevent or
alleviate the disease.

Reality Check on ID Theft
By Sonia Arrison	03/21/2002
Identity theft is a serious concern, but despite calls from regulation
advocates, new privacy laws are not the answer to this insidious crime. As
a new report shows, consumer awareness and better enforcement of existing
laws are the ways to solve this problem.
Advocacy groups such as the San Diego-based Privacy Rights Clearinghouse
estimate that the number of ID thefts - when someone co-opts another
person's identity to commit theft or fraud - is around 750,000 a year. But
numbers from a recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report tell a
different story.
For example, between November 1999 and September 2001, the Federal Trade
Commission's (FTC) Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse only logged a total of
94,100 complaints, a number similar to data from consumer reporting
agencies. This means that the chances of being a victim are less than 0.03
percent - about the same as being hit by a vehicle while crossing the
Responding to concerns that ID theft is increasing, Congress passed the
Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act in 1998. There are also
numerous state laws targeting the crime. With all this legislation, it's
curious that ID theft appears to be increasing.
Many people blame the Internet, because it makes the collection and
transfer of personal information easier. But not only was ID theft
happening long before the Internet became popular, it's also easier for
thieves to obtain data from the trash bin than by breaking into a
business's encrypted online database. This explains why the tips for
avoiding ID theft are mostly low-tech and based on common sense.
One of the best defenses against ID theft is a paper shredder. Destroying
garbage that has tax information (and therefore your social security
number), credit card numbers, and other personal information is a good
idea. Also, don't give your credit card, bank account, or social security
numbers to anyone without knowing who they are and why they want them.
Another way to prevent crooks from snatching your identity is to install a
lockable mailbox - this will prevent thieves from taking your personal
documents before you even see them. Many victims of ID theft do not find
out until months later that their information has been co-opted.
Since businesses collect information about consumers, some regulation
advocates have called for stronger laws governing the collection and use of
that data. But that inaccurately assumes that businesses routinely leak
information. It also threatens consumer convenience and the free flow of
commerce. To meet demand and offer services at the lowest cost, businesses
need information about their customers. So what's the answer?
The key to stopping ID theft may be found by looking at the enforcement
data in the recent GAO report. For instance, in the years 1999 and 2000,
the FBI logged zero convictions for ID theft crimes involving the
fraudulent use of credit cards. This is in comparison to 1996, when they
managed five convictions, and two in both 1997 and 1998.
The Secret Service, another government agency charged with investigating
these crimes, told the GAO that it has "moved away from investigating
street crime level offenders" to targeting large-scale operations. And
local police departments often encounter jurisdictional problems in chasing
ID bandits, which means that even with all the laws against ID theft, few
criminals are brought to justice.
As long as thieves can easily get away with ID crimes, they will continue
to do so, no matter how many laws are on the books. Fortunately, the FTC
has started encouraging law-enforcement over law-creation. But not everyone
has seen the light. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, co-chair of
the National Association of Attorneys General Consumer Protection
Committee, continues to push for more restrictive and costly privacy laws.
That quest comes despite the lack of data showing that the marketing
departments of businesses are responsible for ID theft.
Policymakers and advocates need to recognize that cutting off a business's
ability to market to their customers is not the way to solve the ID theft
issue. A better way to fix the problem is to give police the ability and
incentive to enforce existing laws and to educate consumers on how they can
better protect themselves. That way, consumers will be safe as they shop
both on and offline.

There are several different possible scenarios which fit this description.
My message will overlap a little with the other reply I've seen, for which
I apologize. Here they are in rough order of what I think you're asking.
1) You are trying to distribute an obfuscated binary which
encrypts/decrypts using a secret key, with the goal that the key resist
reverse engineering. The usual application for this is DRM, but you can
also use this to do "public-key encryption" from any symmetric algorithm
(obfuscate the encryption function!).
(disclaimer: I work for ShieldIP, which is a DRM company. All statements
and opinions here are my own.)
There's a recent result showing that there exist some functions which
*cannot* be obfuscated, for several technical formalizations of the notion
"obfuscated." That result is available as:
On the (Im)possibility of Obfuscating Programs
Boaz Barak Oded Goldreich, Russell Impagliazzo, Steven Rudich, Amit Sahai,
Salil Vadhan, Ke Yang
It is important to note that this result doesn't necessarily apply to the
kinds of programs we want to obfuscate in practice. Rather it shows that
there is a large class of "unobfuscatable functions" and builds such
functions through clever means. At least that's my current take; I should
hedge here and say I haven't gone through it thoroughly -- I'd welcome
correction from anyone who's taken more time to map out the practical
implications (for instance, "is it possible that a block cipher could be
Naturally this result hasn't stopped people from trying practical
techniques for code obfuscation. Cloakware ( is just one
of the companies pursuing research into software obfuscation. Doing a
google search for "code obfuscation" provides many links. I don't know
enough to say which of them are any good.
People have also tried to obtain a similar level of protection by
embedding code in tamper-resistant hardware. IBM's ABYSS project was an
early example of this aimed specifically at copy protection. That begat
Citadel which begat 4758 and thus was the begatting begun. As another
message mentions, Atallah/Compaq/HP and Wave Systems today do similar
things. I note that the Intertrust web page mentions a Rights|Chip which
may or may not do similar things. Bennet Yee's thesis, among other places,
is a good place to learn about secure coprocessors.
2) You have an application which uses private keys and you are worried
about writing them to disk. Your adversary is not the user, but someone
who may gain "lunch-time" access to the machine and not plant keyloggers,
bugs, etc, but only transfers files or swap to a diskette. This is kind of
a weak adversary, but it's also about what most co-workers or kid sisters
can mount, and hey we have to protect at least against them...
The best practice here, AFAIK, is to do what PGP does. Encrypt the private
key while it's on disk using some key not on the machine. Then use a
kernel driver to obtain memory which is guaranteed not to be paged to disk
and use that memory for all sensitive operations. Get yourself a copy of
the WinPGP source code and take a look.
3) You are worried about an adversary breaking in and stealing your own
signing or decryption key from your computer. You also just happen to have
a bunch of other computers lying around that are not running the same OS
or same version (so they are unlikely to be cracked at the same time as
your first machine).
Now you're in the territory of "threshold cryptography" and "proactive
security." The MIT Threshold Cryptography page explains it better than I
Dan Boneh's group has put some of these ideas into code:
With "proactive security," you "refresh" machines from time to time so as
to limit damage from machines which are compromised and then renewed.
Here's the abstract from the paper reporting on the IBM implementation.
that paper citation is
B. Barak, A. Herzberg, D. Naor, and E. Shai. The proactive security
toolkit and applications. In Proceedings of the 6th ACM Conference on
Computer and Communications Security (CCS'99), pages 18--27, Kent Ridge
Digital Labs, Singapore, November 1999. ACM SIGSAC, ACM
There used to be an IBM page specifically on the topic of "proactive
security" and they were even going to let people download the toolkit! I
don't think that actually happened. If it did, dude, I'd like to know.

@_subject: Secure peripheral cards (fwd) 
I am searching for some citable references about secure peripheral cards.
Contrary to what I had imagined when I had started searching, I found very
little. I am looking to see what are the peripherals that have
cryptographic capabilities and what are thier capabilities?
The Embassy ( thing seems like a single secure system in
itself, which can run programs and do everything from secure boot to
secure IO. So I imagine that all of this stuff will not be put in the
peripherals. Also in the same vein US patent 6,314,409 talk of a secure
system but in more abstract terms.
Intel's audio players and sigmatels auddio _decoders_ (can be a
comeplte device or a peripheral according to the brochure) seems to calim
Microsoft's DRM compatibility.
I would appreciate some better references.

Reply-to: Zooko List-Help: List-Post: List-Subscribe: ,
List-Id: List-Archive: I gave a talk about my experiences with Mojo Nation at the First International
Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems [1] recently.  Here is the position paper that
accompanied the talk:
"Experiences Deploying a Large Scale Emergent Network"
While speaking in front of this small audience of eminent systems researchers,
and while answering their questions, I realized that a simple hack should
make a
big difference in the overall reliability of the file space:  do not publish
data to a server unless you have seen that server before, more than one
hour ago!
And more generally, use the age and average availability of a server as a
general heuristic for preferring to publish to him.  This was idea was inspired
by a DHT ("distributed hash table") design named "Kademlia" that I really like:
See my paper to understand why this heuristic would make such a big difference.
It is easy to implement something like this using a handicapper, and I
intend to
do it for the next Mnet release.

What works for software is not necessarily extensible to other regimes. A
good example of this is how normal engineering practices are worthless for
writing code. There is zero reason to believe that as a general rule the
process works the other way any better. I'm not sure I'd want to be in a
building built like most software is. You wouldn't even need to hit them
with an airplane to knock them down.
And as somebody that has to deal with his approach daily I can say it
ain't perfect either.
Ask a Booch accolade to define 'simple' and 'complex' sometime. It's
pretty funny.
It's worth the additional insite to realize you're participating in one of
my 'worthless' forwards. As much as you bitch even you must admit (through
your actions if not words, and which speaks louder?) you got sucked into
them...not as worthless as you'd have people believe.

Bankers (at least in the modern sense) don't create 'money', they create
'value'. This 'value' is a function of 'time'. The 'real assets' are
a convenience and a mechanism to guarantee compliance so the banker gets
something out of it for their 'time'.
What a banker 'sells' is 'time'. You can have it 'now' rather than 'later'
by paying me 'interest' over a longer 'time'.

Worldwide Caution - Public Announcement
March 17, 2002
The U.S. Government continues to receive credible reports that extremist
individuals are planning additional terrorist actions against U.S.
interests. Such actions may be imminent and include suicide operations. We
have no further information on specific targets, timing or method of attack.
We remind American citizens to remain vigilant with regard to their personal
security and to exercise caution.
Terrorist groups do not distinguish between official and civilian targets.
The March 17 attack on worshippers at the Protestant International Church in
Islamabad underlines the growing possibility that as security is increased
at official U.S. facilities, terrorists and their sympathizers will seek
softer targets. These may include facilities where Americans are generally
known to congregate or visit, such as clubs, restaurants, places of worship,
schools or outdoor recreation events. Americans should increase their
security awareness when they are at such locations, avoid them, or switch to
other locations where Americans in large numbers generally do not
congregate. American citizens may be targeted for kidnapping. In late
January 2002, an American journalist was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan.
U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a heightened state of alert.
These facilities may on occasion temporarily close or suspend public
services to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy. In those
instances, U.S. Embassies and Consulates will make every effort to provide
emergency services to American citizens. Americans are urged to monitor the
local news and maintain contact with the nearest American Embassy or
The Department will continue to develop information about potential threats
to Americans overseas and to share with them credible threat information
through its Consular Information Program documents. These documents are
available on the Internet at  In addition to
information on the Internet, U.S. travelers may hear recorded information by
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at 202-647-5225 from
their touch-tone telephone, or receive information by automated telefax by
dialing 202-647-3000 from their fax machine.
This Public Announcement - Worldwide Caution supersedes the previous
Worldwide Caution of February 1, 2002 to note the imminent threat of
terrorist actions which may target civilians and include suicide operations.
This Public Announcement - Worldwide Caution expires on August 17, 2002.

Actually not, if the various agents involved act as if the lie is the
truth then at some point their actions will come into conflict. In fact
this sort of behaviour can lead to the failure of various sorts of

not sure the problem applies to somebody who WANTS to be lied to as you
posit by implication with your extension. There is an implicit 'critical'
factor in the original problem as posed, we assume no cooperation between -all- the players, there is at least one 'honest' one.
The game where there is one honest player is -not- the same game as no
honest players.
Changing the rules in the middle of the game will -almost always- allow
one to manipulate the discussion to a desired goal. But then again there
goes that -critical- factor in such a co-operative environment. Thank
goodness this isn't one of those ;)

cryptography
The fastest computer in the world has just gone on line in Japan. Called
the Earth Simulator, makers NEC Corp say the ultra-high-speed computing
system can perform 40 trillion operations per second or 40 teraflops.
The computer is designed to enable environmental research by analysing and
simulating the global environment. To do so it creates a virtual planet
 The aim was to create a computer which could achieve a thousand times
higher performance for meteorological, geophysical and environmental
applications than any other computer.
Until now the world's quickest computer has been the ASCI White made by
IBM. It has an output of 12.3 teraflops and occupies only a fifth of the
space taken up by the Earth Simulator.

Draw a picture. If you don't have a place to post it I can arrange a page
You take three nodes.
Arrange them in a ring/triangle. Each node branches to 295(?) other nodes (making it a member of three 100 node subnets - somehow these numbers
don't add up). It's not clear if those are a 'one to many' branch or if
that node simply has two links to two other nodes in the ring (which has a
total of 100 nodes). And where did the '2 other triangles' come from? We
start with a single triange that is a member of a larger set the nodes of
which are the members of a -two triangle- set? Why is 'our' triangle
Is this a 'big version' of the 'Caveman World'?

The Internet is somewhere around 17/18, I use 20 for estimates of scale.
If you'd like to partake in a wireless - distributed processing experiment
of this sort...
The idea is to get a Plan 9 backbone running with distributed process and
file resources at the nodes. Each node would be distant from the others.
We have two nodes in Austin and one in New York. We're working on Raleigh,
N. Carolina, one potential in Kansas, and two in Cali. Each local node
would become involved in the local 'guerrilla network' scene. It is
supported through a tit-for-tat approach to access.
More info on Plan 9...
No references available at the moment, but there's been a lot of neat work
the last few years on hyper-dimensional networks. The most common variety
is a 4-D cube. The model that I use is the 'Spiney Sea Urchin' model. Each
node has a lot of short range connections, and a few long range
connections. It would be perfectly permissible to raise that to another
level and add a directed dimensionality to it. For example force each node
to have the same number of connections as the number of edges meeting at a
vertex on a 4-D cube.

Sent: 24 April 2002 15:37
...named "McAfee E-Business Desktop".  Just had a talk with our local
sales rep.  From our talk, and from what I can see on the URL above,
this appears to be (or at least incorporate) portions of PGP desktop,
with some restrictions:
- Purchaser must already have at least one E-Business Server license
(PGP Server in conjunction with some other crypto), at $2000 per license
- The product appears to require interaction with the server in order to
function -- no more standalone crypto?
Unknown are:
- whether there is a commandline interface, or if the app is scriptable
- whether there is compatibility with existing PGP keyrings
- key management -- is there a central repository, and how is it
- does crypto occur only on the server, or on the desktop?  If the
former, some interesting security issues
Still awaiting word on:
- whether NAI will still sell us licenses to make more copies of 6.5.8
(so far, answer is "doubtful")
Q.  Why not use 6.5.8 freeware (for which there is source?)
A.  If used commercially, a license must be purchased from NAI -- same
as for commercial 6.5.8
Q.  What about gnupg?
A.  Possibility -- some key compatibility issues exist that may or may
not affect us.  Someone would need to build and own the code.

Gartner supports HK smart ID card use
DOUG NAIRNE
Research firm Gartner has issued a favourable report on Hong Kong's
contentious smart identification card programme, saying the initiative will
put Hong Kong at the forefront of deploying the technology.
Dion Wiggins, research director at Gartner Group in Hong Kong, said the SAR
was continuing its history of pioneering smart card use with its decision
to issue ID cards with an embedded chip to all residents.
"Once implemented, Hong Kong will be well-positioned to deliver efficient
government services as well as provide greater security, community
benefits, access and streamlined secure e-commerce to its entire
population," Mr Wiggins wrote in a briefing paper last week.
"The implementation of the [smart card] project will take Hong Kong a long
way towards its goal of being one of the first truly digital economies."
Australia-based Gartner analyst Robin Simpson said Hong Kong would be the
first government to implement a multi-purpose, multi-application smart ID
for its population.
"One reason that the Hong Kong SAR project is so significant is that for
the first time, smart card infrastructure will be very widely deployed
across the whole geography to service the entire population," he said.
Mr Simpson said other jurisdictions had wrestled with a dilemma where
citizens would not want smart cards unless they could use them everywhere,
but enterprise would not deploy sufficient infrastructure unless a large
number of people had smart cards.
He said the project was also significant because it was the first time a
government had encouraged private enterprise to take advantage of the smart
card infrastructure by allowing certified third-party applications to be
loaded on to the cards.
The new ID card programme will be formally launched in July, and the cards
will be phased in over four years.
They will store data including a photograph and fingerprints, and can
optionally be used as a digital certificate, driving licence and library
Despite government assurances that the information stored on the cards will
be secure, there have been concerns over forgery or theft.
However, Gartner concludes that the existing ID card system, which was
introduced in 1987, is "outdated and no longer able to meet the growing
needs of the . . . Government".
Mr Wiggins said Hong Kong's small population and mandatory identity card
programme made the adoption of smart cards easier to execute.
He said the HK$3 billion programme cost is only 10 per cent higher than the
cost to replace existing ID cards with a non-smart ID.
Gartner concludes that Hong Kong will be one of the few places where smart
ID cards are embraced in the near future.
In the United States, where the Government is pondering a national ID card
programme in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, there has been
fierce resistance to the idea.
Adding smart functions to the cards will make them even less palatable,
Gartner predicts.
The report said: "National identification cards will face a steep uphill
battle that will impede their deployment and acceptance in the US. Through
2007, US-based identification card deployers will encounter substantial
resistance to adoption that will increase with added functionality."

there are some neat tricks in this implementation.  Ben Handley
from the University of Otago in New Zealand worked for us last
winter and spent some time on a fast implementation of the
block Lanczos algorithm with the speed critical sections done
in Itanium machine code.  This was one step towards the goal of
showing that 512 bit keys can be factored without having to use
a supercomputer but can in fact be factored using just what we
had in the office.  The technology is little different from the
stuff done to solve the last puzzle in The Codebook other than
the fact that few offices have quad-processor Compaq Alpha
servers but an increasingly large number have Win2K servers
with Itaniums in them.

if he reads this list so I will forward this message to him in
case he wants to add more.

Exactly, PRNG's -will- repeat in one of these two ways. RNG's will repeat
strictly speakin only for small k-distributions of characters. The smaller
the better.
As to the second, wrong. pi has lots of examples of repeats (visit the Pi
page and see for yourself) at different k-distribution scales. What pi
won't do is repeat the entire sequence; 314159...........314159...
If it did that would make it rational (eg 66666 or 328328328328...328...).
Not the same thing at all.

No, correct. It's called -infinity distribution- and is a -requirement-
for RNG's to be accepted as such.
No, that-s 1-distributed, not infinity-distributed. There are many
k-distributions. This guarangees the -largest- string that will repeat.
Clearly you can't have even a PRNG in this case.
If you have i characters and want a sequence of length greater than i then
clearly 1-distributions must be allowed.
Read Knuth, and quite arguing just to argue.

Actually neither of these are requirement for RNG's. You're fist comment
about 'some method' tends to shoot your argument in the foot right off.
As to the second, no you don't need infinite ram to create a RNG. Please
demonstrate the proof. What you need is -continuity-, not -infinity-.
They're not the same thing. If all it took was infinite memory then a
standard Turing machine could, by your thesis, generate a RNG and we know
from basic principles that isn't possible. Why? Their tape is of infinite
length and zero access time.
Depends on the key, in general the modulus of the PRNG is key dependent.
This is another weakness PRNG's.
In addition, the vast majority of PRNG's have a modulus considerably below
2^256. Most of them I've worked with have had modulus lengths less than a
couple of million.

The fourth release of the Plan 9 operating system from Bell
Labs packages a major overhaul of the system at every level.
kernel, libraries, and applications, almost everything has
been modified and, in many cases, redesigned or rewritten.
The most significant change is that 9P has been redesigned
to address a number of shortcomings, most important, its
previous inability to handle long file names.  Unfortu-
nately, squeezing long names onto the disks of existing file
servers is a messy business that we're still grappling with,
so at the moment fs(4) and kfs(4) can't yet handle long
names, although they do talk the new protocol.  (In fact,
they talk both old and new, as required, to ease transi-
tion.) In the meantime, there is a workaround - lnfs(4) -
and many of the other file servers such as ramfs(4) and
u9fs(4) work just fine with long names.  It's only the stan-
dard disk-resident file servers that don't, and as soon we
have versions that do, we'll release them.
The following is a partial list of the major changes
throughout the system.
* The file system protocol, 9P, has been reworked.  It now
has variable-length names, so it can handle long names but
also is more compact when handling short ones.  It uses a
different format that is easily parsed, eliminating the need
for the old aux/fcall utility, and delegates its authenti-
cation duties to an external agent, factotum.
* Security has been a focus of attention.  A new security
agent, factotum(4), manages passwords and other secrets
and, coupled with a new secure file store secstore(4),
enables secure single sign-on.
* Cpu, import, and exportfs all encrypt their connections
now, and since they use the new 9P they also use new network
port numbers.  A new service aan(1) is used by import to
make its network connections more reliable in the face of
network outages.  The old ports still work, through the
agency of a protocol conversion filter srvold9p(4).
* We are phasing out the IL protocol since it doesn't handle
long-distance connections well (and long-distance networks
don't handle it well, either).  IL is still used by fs(4)
(in time, that too will change) but TCP has become the stan-
dard protocol for all other services.
* The software for the new network-resident secure block
store, venti(8), is included with this distribution.  We
are in the process of reworking fs(4) to use Venti rather
than a WORM as its permanent block repository/backup medium,
but that code is only in the design stage and is not
included in this release.
* The need to handle longer file names triggered a rethink-
ing of the way the system handles strings in general.  The
kernel is now more explanatory when it gives an error mes-
sage and more consistent in how it handles strings such as
commands to devices.  The interfaces to many of the system
calls, such as errstr(2) and wait(2) all had to change as
a result, as did the library interface to read directories,
stat(2) and its relatives.
* The formatted I/O package described in print(2) and
fmtinstall(2) has been redesigned.  Although the basic
interface is unchanged, it now runs without locks and has an
internal buffer management mechanism that means print no
longer needs a large on-stack buffer.  The interface for
writing custom print verbs and custom formatted I/O routines
has also been greatly improved.
* The thread library thread(2) has been completely rewrit-
ten.  The main visible change is that, coupled with the
changes to printing, threadprint is gone; you can just use
print or fprint at will.
* Support for electronic mail has been extended in many ways
and now includes some new spam filtering tools, much better
(and more standard) handling of MIME messages, the ability
to render incoming HTML mail, and much more.
There are so many changes to the programming interfaces of
the system that they are described in a separate document,
entitled Changes to the Programming Environment in the
Fourth Release of Plan 9.  Please read it before you start
updating your own software to run under the new system.
The installation method has also changed and we're moving
towards a new method for maintaining updates.  The Plan 9
Wiki ( and Usenet
group (comp.os.plan9) are the places to visit to learn more
and stay current.  In particular, the installation notes are
now maintained in the Wiki; the traditional papers on
installation and start-up are gone.
There's lots more new stuff.  If you have problems, mail
9trouble or, better, check the wiki
 or ask the Usenet
newsgroup comp.os.plan9.
Good Luck!

@_subject: Re: objectivity and factoring analysis (fwd) 
I'm inclined to agree with you there
Since you mention it, I will make a comment for the purpose of
clearing up a number of misunderstandings about what I said
and the context in which the comments were made.
At the Financial Cryptography 2002 conference a small and
impromptu panel was convened to discuss the Bernstein
proposal.  Since I'm in the business of building hardware I
was asked to comment on the cost of building some of the
hardware described therein.  I limited myself to comments
about the design for the engine that could be used to take
the results of the sieve process and compute values leading
to a pair of roots, and furthermore prefaced and qualified
my comments with strong statements about any numbers being
very rough back of an envelope calculations.  The estimate
of the cost of construction I gave was "some hundreds of
millions of dollars", a figure by which I still stand.
I was then asked how fast this machine would run and I tried
to do the calculation on the spot without a copy of the
proposal to hand, and came up with a figure on the order
of a second based on very conservative hardware design.
This figure is *wildly* erroneous as a result of both not
having the paper to hand and also not even having an
envelope on the back of which I could scratch notes.  The
number was based on a miscalculation of the number of
clock ticks the circuit would need by a factor of 10^11,
which is a vast error that is only slightly moderated by
the fact that on further analysis I concluded that the
hardware could be made to operate on a clock that ran
between 10^3 and 10^4 times faster since the inter-circuit
communication did not need to be as slow as I had originally
thought.  Thus I think that with care a matrix reduction
machine of the sort described could be built to run in a few
weeks or months for 1024 bit keys.
Despite all the qualifying of these statements I felt then,
and still feel now, that if you have keys that you think
rich governments might genuinely be interested in then you
should use ones that are longer than 1024 bits.  If you have
personal information that you want to keep secret from rich
governments for many years to come then you should probably
use longer keys anyway.  After all we can expect on past form
that the security agencies are some years ahead of the
academic state of the art in this field anyway.  On the
other hand if you are moving general commercial data around
on an everyday basis I don't think that there is much wrong
with 1024 bits keys and I would not, and have not, suggested
that there is anything insecure about such key lengths for,
say, electronic banking or e-commerce using SSL.
I have to say that Adam's suggestion that there was some
sort of ulterior motive for my comments is both disingenuous
and somewhat insulting.  In the context of short and impromptu
discussion on a topic which people felt was a live one, I made
a back of the envelope calculation in which I used the "time"
figure as the "cost" figure and came up with totally the wrong
number.  I wasn't expecting that this was going to then be
used as the basis for anything other than maybe an excuse for
looking into the problem a little more deeply.  The critical
problem here seems to be that Lucky then quoted this number on
a mailing list before I'd had a chance to look more closely.
I don't think that there was any conflict of interest involved
at all given both the nature of the discussion and the fact
that these days cryptographic acceleration is pretty peripheral
to the nature of my business.
I agree entirely.  The field of factoring is still moving forward
and with luck Bernstien's proposal will lead to him getting funding,
which will lead to new advances, and this my yet necessitate longer
keys in the future.  The biggest cause for concern with regards to
factoring at the moment is that 17% of the SSL servers on the net
are still using 512 bit keys and in countries like France (which have
in the past had domestic usage controls) the figure is more like 40%.
My research student last winter showed that 512 bit keys can be
factored in a matter of weeks using only the hardware found in a
busy 70 person office.  People tend not to change over existing
keys for longer ones as time goes by and now that 512 bit keys are
low hanging fruit people's inertia and resistance to altering working
server configurations is in danger of becoming a real problem.
I think your suggestion of bias is itself misplaced.  Most of
the comments on this that I have seen have been pretty measured.
Even if your cynicism is well founded in some cases I think that
the real problem here has been people being too swift to quote
and too slow to check with the source.

New tool helps hackers evade detection
By Robert Lemos
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
April 19, 2002, 9:45 AM PT
A new tool for manipulating packets of data that travel over the Internet
could allow attackers to camouflage malicious programs just enough to
bypass many intrusion-detection systems and firewalls.
The tool, called Fragroute, performs several techniques to fool the
signature-based recognition systems used by many intrusion-detection
systems and firewalls. Many of these duping techniques were outlined in a
research paper published four years ago.
Arbor Networks security researcher Dug Song posted the tool to his Web site
this week. Arbor is a network protection company.
"(Some) firewalls and intrusion prevention or other application-layer
content-filtering devices have similar vulnerabilities that may be tested
with Fragroute," Song wrote in a posting to security mailing list Bugtraq
on Thursday.
The new tool tips the arms race between those who look to break in to
networks and those who defend them toward the attackers, at least for the
moment. Any firewall or intrusion-detection system that fails the Fragroute
test is vulnerable attack from vandals using the program.
Song was traveling and could not be reached for comment, an Arbor
representative said, and his company would not comment on the issue.
The Fragroute program is a dual-use program: It illuminates weaknesses in a
network's security--information that can aid a system administrator in
protecting the network or helping a hacker attack the network. The program
exploits several ways of inserting specific data into a sequence of
information to fool detection programs. The methods were highlighted in a
January 1998 paper written by Thomas Ptacek and Timothy Newsham of security
specialist Secure Networks, a company later bought by Network Associates.
The program exploits intrusion-detection systems, which often check the
correctness of incoming data less stringently than the server software that
is typically targeted by hackers. In one version of such "insertion"
attacks, a command sent to a server could be disguised by adding
extraneous, illegitimate data. The targeted server software will throw away
any bad data, leaving itself with a valid, but malicious, command.
However, many intrusion-detection systems don't remove the corrupted data,
so the hostile command remains disguised from the system's recognition
For example, an intrusion-detection system that watches out for a recent
buffer overflow might recognize the attack by the text " appearing
in the incoming data. However, if an attacker sends
" and knows that the "somegarbagehere" portion will
be thrown out by the target computer, then the attack still works.
Moreover, if the intrusion-detection system doesn't remove the same text
portion as the server, it won't recognize the threat.
Marti Roesch, president of security appliance seller SourceFire and the
creator of the popular open-source intrusion-detection system Snort, said
that the majority of the problems exploited by Fragroute have been fixed,
and he plans to fix the rest by next week.
"Dug contacted me about this stuff several months ago, and I fixed it,"
Roesch said.
While he hasn't programmed a defense to every stealth attack that Fragroute
has in its repertoire, doing so won't be hard, he added.
"Many of these take 10 minutes of coding, max, to fix," he said. "It just
wasn't an issue before."
While many of the attacks won't work against Snort if it's configured
properly, Roesch said that the default configuration doesn't detect the
camouflaged data, because such settings produce a far greater number of
false alarms.
Some security aficionados posting to the Bugtraq list concentrated on Snort
as a program vulnerable to the Fragroute program, but Song waved off the
implied criticism on the open-source program in his posting.
"Snort, I'd wager, does much better than most," he wrote, adding that many
other proprietary programs are also vulnerable.
One commercial software seller, network protection firm Internet Security
Systems, claimed that its product, RealSecure, wasn't affected.
"We initially fixed the fragmentation issues when we saw the paper quite
some time ago," said Dan Ingevaldson, team lead for the company's security
research and development group.
His group tested Song's tool earlier this week, and they were still able to
detect attacks, Ingevaldson said.

cryptography
Despite law, few people use e-signatures
By Troy Wolverton
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
April 17, 2002, 4:00 AM PT
Even in the Internet age, your John Hancock still matters.
Most people are still putting pen to paper these days, despite a law signed
by former President Clinton nearly two years ago that made electronic
signatures the legal equivalent of traditional signatures.
Electronic signatures were supposed to wipe out the need for time-consuming
and costly efforts to sign certain documents. Bank loans, refinancing
paperwork and legal documents were all targeted by backers of electronic
signatures, with the idea of eliminating the need for meetings, notary
publics or overnight deliveries to validate signatures.
The technology certainly exists, but the promise of e-signatures has
fizzled in the face of security concerns, competing e-signature standards
and the fact that, when it comes to big deals, people still like to handle
"I think a lot of people, even e-savvy people, are frankly more comfortable
in document-intensive transactions having a stack of paper to look at,
review and sign with someone present," said Ian Ballon, an attorney who
focuses on Internet and e-commerce law at Manatt, Phelp & Phillips, in Palo
Alto, Calif.
Proponents of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
Act, which took effect in November 2000, thought the reality would be
somewhat different. Under the law, a simple click of a mouse could replace
a physical signature. Supporters of the law hoped it would revolutionize
e-commerce, decreasing paperwork, speeding transactions and allowing
consumers to buy cars or get mortgages completely online.
But people can already buy books, video games and Beanie Babies online
without signing their name and without the e-signature law. Meanwhile, most
high-end purchases, such as buying a car, and many financial transactions,
such as refinancing a home, still require consumers to put ink to paper.
"By and large, the e-sign law hasn't had much of an effect," said Chris
Musto, an analyst with Gomez. "It's hard for me to point to when it will."
To be sure, e-sign has led to some changes. Last summer, Wells Fargo began
allowing students to apply for U.S. government-backed loans entirely online
using a Department of Education-issued personal identification number.
Meanwhile brokerages such as E*Trade allow customers to sign up and fund
accounts completely online and have begun delivering account statements and
updates electronically.
The limitations of e-filing taxes
The recent tax season illustrates one of the highest-profile uses--and
problems--of e-signatures so far. The Internal Revenue Service has been
accepting electronically filed tax returns since 1997, but until last year,
it required most taxpayers who e-filed to mail in a signed form. The agency
now allows taxpayers to select their own PIN to use as an e-signature, once
they've been verified by giving their date of birth and their adjusted
gross income from their previous tax return.
But e-filing has been slow to take off, despite the push from the IRS, with
about two-thirds of taxpayers still mailing in paper returns with
traditional signatures.
Not helping matters, the IRS has restricted the types of forms that
taxpayers can file electronically, and its process for verifying e-filed
returns rejects about 10 percent of them because of birth dates, Social
Security numbers or other information that doesn't match numbers stored in
often outdated IRS databases. Security is also an issue: Last year, the
General Accounting Office issued a report that highlighted numerous
security vulnerabilities on the IRS's servers.
Another reason why the e-sign bill hasn't lived up to its hype is that
while the law said electronic signatures have the same validity as those
made on paper, it didn't specify what constituted an electronic signature.
Prior to the law, a consensus was building around recognizing digital
signatures--those based on public key infrastructure (PKI)--as a legal
standard for signing documents online. PKI uses encryption keys to lock and
unlock data. But because the e-sign law didn't recognize any particular
standard for electronic signatures, it threw the standards battle back up
for grabs, some analysts say.
"What e-sign really did was blow away PKI," said John Pescatore, research
director for Internet security at Gartner. "All that legal work went away."
In the absence of a standard, many companies have been reluctant to accept
electronic signatures because the law and electronic signatures haven't
been put to a court test yet. And with few companies accepting electronic
signatures, there's been little opportunity to test their validity in the
"You get into a chicken-and-egg situation," Pescatore said.
Plus there has been little consumer demand--which isn't that surprising at
a time when many customers are still uncomfortable using their credit cards
online, let alone making major, complicated purchases or agreements.
Little legal recourse
Customers may even be at a greater risk with e-signatures than they are
with credit cards online. With a credit card, customers generally have
complete protection for online purchases and aren't liable if the card is
stolen or used without their authorization.
The same isn't true of e-signatures, which are usually secured by giving a
customer a particular PIN to get access to a "signature page" on a Web
site. If someone were to fraudulently sign up for a mortgage or purchase a
car in another person's name via an electronic signature, the person who
had been defrauded would have little legal recourse.
"If I steal your electronic signature, I can order drugs, I can sell your
house," said Margot Saunders, a managing attorney at the National Consumer
Law Center. "People have not thought through the problem of replacing a
very simple signature that has so many implicit effects with an electronic
Businesses have also hesitated to fully embrace e-signatures. Texas
Instruments, for instance, has set up an extranet for communicating with
its suppliers and distributors. Through the network, TI's partners can
place and track orders.
Although the system relies on encrypted, digital signatures to verify TI's
partners, those electronic signatures don't replace the pen-on-paper kind.
TI provides access to the system only to companies that already have
existing relationships--and paper contracts--with the electronics giant.
"From a legal agreement standpoint, e-signatures is not the mechanism we
use today," John Jordan, IT security manager for TI. "I think there's still
a lot of apprehension" about using e-signatures.
Some are hoping the government will lead the way, particularly since
Congress has ordered federal agencies to reduce paperwork and do more
transactions electronically. The mandate has several federal agencies
turning to companies such as Entrust, an online security company.
Entrust has about 40 projects going on with the federal government and
recently helped set up a digital signatures program at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office that allows attorneys to electronically file patent
applications, according to Daniel Burton, vice president of government
affairs at Entrust.
"I think the government has taken some positive steps," Burton said. "Could
they do more? Absolutely."
Some say it will simply take more time.
Consumers will soon be able to buy term life insurance and auto insurance
online with e-signatures, said Behnam Dayanim, an attorney with Paul,
Hastings, Jenosky & Walker, in Washington, D.C., who lobbied for the e-sign
bill. But Dayanim noted that businesses are increasingly relying on
electronic transactions to speed deals within their companies or among
their established business partners. Such transactions might not be true
e-signatures since they usually rely on paper signatures on file, but they
are a sign of progress, he said.
"When you look globally, it's had a really pervasive but subtle effect on
how people do business," Dayanim said. "There's more and more transactions
where the parties effectuate the transactions online. I think that's in
part attributable to e-sign."

Tuesday April 16, 2002
On Sunday, the US government will launch an
international coup. It has been planned for a month.
It will be executed quietly, and most of us won't know
what is happening until it's too late. It is seeking
to overthrow 60 years of multilateralism in favour of
a global regime built on force. The coup begins with its attempt, in five days' time,
to unseat the man in charge of ridding the world of
chemical weapons. If it succeeds, this will be the
first time that the head of a multilateral agency will
have been deposed in this manner. Every other
international body will then become vulnerable to
attack. The coup will also shut down the peaceful
options for dealing with the chemical weapons Iraq may
possess, helping to ensure that war then becomes the
only means of destroying them. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW) enforces the chemical weapons
convention. It inspects labs and factories and
arsenals and oversees the destruction of the weapons
they contain. Its director-general is a workaholic
Brazilian diplomat called Jose Bustani. He has,
arguably, done more in the past five years to promote
world peace than anyone else on earth. His inspectors
have overseen the destruction of 2 million chemical
weapons and two-thirds of the world's chemical weapon
facilities. He has so successfully cajoled reluctant
nations that the number of signatories to the
convention has risen from 87 to 145 in the past five
years: the fastest growth rate of any multilateral
body in recent times. In May 2000, as a tribute to his extraordinary record,
Bustani was re-elected unanimously by the member
states for a second five-year term, even though he had
yet to complete his first one. Last year Colin Powell
wrote to him to thank him for his "very impressive"
work. But now everything has changed. The man
celebrated for his achievements has been denounced as
an enemy of the people. In January, with no prior warning or explanation, the
US state department asked the Brazilian government to
recall him, on the grounds that it did not like his
"management style". This request directly contravenes
the chemical weapons convention, which states "the
director-general ... shall not seek or receive
instructions from any government". Brazil refused. In
March the US government accused Bustani of "financial
mismanagement", "demoralisation" of his staff, "bias"
and "ill-considered initiatives". It warned that if he
wanted to avoid damage to his reputation, he must
resign. Again, the US was trampling the convention, which
insists that member states shall "not seek to
influence" the staff. He refused to go. On March 19
the US proposed a vote of no confidence in Bustani. It
lost. So it then did something unprecedented in the
history of multi lateral diplomacy. It called a
"special session" of the member states to oust him.
The session begins on Sunday. And this time the US is
likely to get what it wants. Since losing the vote last month, the United States,
which is supposed to be the organisation's biggest
donor, has been twisting the arms of weaker nations,
refusing to pay its dues unless they support it, with
the result that the OPCW could go under. Last week
Bustani told me, "the Europeans are so afraid that the
US will abandon the convention that they are prepared
to sacrifice my post to keep it on board". His last
hope is that the United Kingdom, whose record of
support for the organisation has so far been
exemplary, will make a stand. The meeting on Sunday
will present Tony Blair's government with one of the
clearest choices it has yet faced between
multilateralism and the "special relationship". The US has not sought to substantiate the charges it
has made against Bustani. The OPCW is certainly
suffering from a financial crisis, but that is largely
because the US unilaterally capped its budget and then
failed to pay what it owed. The organisation's
accounts have just been audited and found to be
perfectly sound. Staff morale is higher than any
organisation as underfunded as the OPCW could
reasonably expect. Bustani's real crimes are contained
in the last two charges, of "bias" and "ill-considered
initiatives". The charge of bias arises precisely because the OPCW
is not biased. It has sought to examine facilities in
the United States with the same rigour with which it
examines facilities anywhere else. But, just like
Iraq, the US has refused to accept weapons inspectors
from countries it regards as hostile to its interests,
and has told those who have been allowed in which
parts of a site they may and may not inspect. It has
also passed special legislation permitting the
president to block unannounced inspections, and
banning inspectors from removing samples of its
chemicals. Do You Yahoo!?

World conflicts continue to put pressure on oil prices.
(New York) The Middle East continues to be an extremely volatile
area with peace nowhere in sight in spite of Colin Powel's efforts
to bring the two sides closer to a solution.
This coupled with the return to power of President Hugo Chavez
of Venezuela after just two days of being ousted from office is
bound to put immediate upward pressure on the price of oil in
the world markets.
Savvy investors should consider undervalued oil & gas stocks NOW
as a way of profiting from the anticipated higher oil & gas prices.
We have identified an energy player engaged in the acquisition,  development and production of natural gas and oil  with proven
reserves as well as very low per barrel production costs.

Bruce Schneier writes in the April 15, 2002, CRYPTO-GRAM,
Does anyone else notice the contradiction in these two paragraphs?
First Bruce says that businesses can reasonably be content with 1024 bit
keys, then he appears shocked that Lucky Green still has a 1024 bit key?
Why is it so awful for Lucky to "still" have a key of this size, if 1024
bit keys are good enough to be "reasonably content" about?

Behind the Rage
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
KHARTOUM, Sudan  It's a measure of the rage spreading
across the Middle East that even in this dusty
capital, almost at the edge of the world, several
hundred thousand people have marched through the
streets denouncing Israel and America  and in some
cases cheering Osama bin Laden.
Elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of Moroccans have
taken to the streets to demonstrate, in their
country's biggest protest ever. And four people have
been killed in the huge protests that are shaking
Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain, Tunisia and other
countries. This frenzy in the Arab world is fascinating, because
while the Israeli brutality in the occupied
territories is real, it is small potatoes by Arab
Some 1,600 Palestinians have been killed since the
latest round of violence erupted in the fall of 2000.
In contrast, two million Sudanese have died in the
ongoing civil war here, with barely anyone noticing.
Likewise, Syria blithely killed about 20,000 people in
crushing an abortive uprising in the city of Hama in
1982. And Saddam Hussein, who has killed more Arabs
than Ariel Sharon and all his Israeli predecessors put
together, is somehow a hero for much of the Arab
What's going on here? After lots of soul-searching
conversations with Arabs, I'm inclined toward a couple
of conclusions:
First, there is a double standard; the Arab world is
outraged in large part because it is Israel that is
killing Arabs this time. Second, despite the double
standard, the outrage is still sincere and deeply
threatening to pro-American Arab governments; there is
a tendency among Israel's supporters to assume that
the rage must be feigned, but that's a fantasy.
In fairness, this kind of double standard is common
around the globe. White-ruled South Africa provoked
anger throughout the world, while worse abuses in
Zaire, Zimbabwe and Nigeria were ignored. And many
Chinese still despise all Japanese, even though Mao
slaughtered far more Chinese than Japanese militarists
ever managed to.
Michael C. Hudson, a professor of Arab studies at
Georgetown University, offered several reasons that
Arab outrage is going off the charts: The Palestinian
problem is bigger than other concerns, for it has
involved an entire society, several wars and the
disruption of neighboring countries; it is older,
having burdened the Arab consciousness since the end
of World War I; it is more visible, emerging from
television screens every moment; it is worse, at least
in perception.
"Whether you measure it in deaths, eviction from home
and homeland, destruction and loss of property, the
ruination of lives in refugee camps, psychological
damage to children, or the continual insults from the
conquerors and their American patron  this issue is
an existential nightmare from which there seems no
awakening," Professor Hudson said.
Another reason for the double standard in the Middle
East is that Arab countries are shame-based societies,
and Israeli repression of Arabs is seen not just as
brutal, but also as humiliating.
When a group of Yemenis scolded me for American
support of Israel, I retorted that America supports
the Middle Eastern leader who gives his Arab citizens
the greatest political freedom, and that's Ariel
Sharon. There was a long pause. Then one replied that
Israel is a colonial outpost and that as a result
while Israeli Arabs may have ballots and free speech,
they have no dignity. In other words, protesters are
enraged not just because Israel kills Arabs, but also
because it humiliates them.
"The Israeli occupation represents a total humiliation
of all the Arab regimes," says Sami Al-Arian, a
Palestinian activist in Florida. "It's a continuous
reminder of the weakness of the Arabs as people, of
their society and political system, as well as an
indication of the impotence and corruption of their
Israelis should not feel reassured just because Arab
protests reflect a double standard. In the mid-1980's
I covered South African business leaders for a time,
and anguished whites there constantly pointed out the
double standard of the scrutiny and moral expectations
on them. They had a point, but the world did not stop
to listen and in the end it didn't matter that there
were many far worse sinners. Do You Yahoo!?

Pakistan Consular Information Sheet
U.S. Department of State
Bureau of Consular Affairs
Washington, DC  20520
April 4, 2002
WARNING (Issued March 22, 2002):  This Travel Warning is being issued to
alert Americans that the Department has ordered the departure of all
non-emergency personnel and family members of the U.S. Embassy and
Consulates in Pakistan.  The possibility of threats to Americans continues,
as demonstrated by the March 17 attack on worshippers at a church service in
Islamabad underscoring the possibility that terrorists may seek civilian
targets.  This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning for Pakistan
dated March 18, 2002.
The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to Pakistan.
Terrorist groups have demonstrated a willingness to hit civilian as well as
official targets.  An American journalist was kidnapped and brutally
murdered in Karachi in early 2002.  The Department has reports that American
citizens generally have been targeted for kidnapping or other terrorist
actions.  The March 17 attack on worshippers at the Protestant International
Church in Islamabad, where two Americans were killed and several more were
injured, underscores the growing possibility that as security is increased
at official U.S. facilities, terrorists and their sympathizers will seek
less well-protected targets.  These may include facilities where Americans
are generally known to congregate or visit, such as clubs, restaurants,
places of worship, schools or outdoor recreation events.
As a result of these concerns, the Department has ordered the departure of
non-emergency personnel and family members of the Embassy and Consulates in
Pakistan.  Americans in Pakistan are urged to consider departing the
country.  The Embassy and Consulates in Pakistan will remain available for
American citizen services.  However, from time to time, the missions in
Pakistan may temporarily close or suspend public services as necessary to
review their security posture.  Americans seeking assistance should
telephone the Embassy or Consulates before visiting there in person to
ensure the offices are open.
The Government of Pakistan continues to give full support to the
international campaign against terrorism.  As Operation Enduring Freedom
defeats Al-Qaida strongholds in Afghanistan, some
Al-Qaida members have fled to Pakistan and other countries.  This, coupled
with the presence of indigenous sectarian and militant groups in Pakistan,
requires that all Americans in or traveling through Pakistan take
appropriate security measures.  Events in the Middle East also increase the
possibility of violence.
American citizens should also be aware that there are many areas of Pakistan
which are restricted by the Government of Pakistan and require
non-Pakistanis to obtain official permission before they may travel to them.
This includes the tribal areas of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province,
areas along the Line of Control, the Pakistan-India border and near other
sensitive areas and facilities.  Travelers need to determine beforehand
whether the areas they intend to visit have any Pakistan government
restrictions on them.  If so, then the appropriate authorities must be
contacted and approval obtained before travel is undertaken.
Americans who reside in or visit Pakistan should exercise maximum caution
and take prudent measures.  They should avoid crowds, demonstrations, and
areas where Americans generally congregate.
U.S. citizens who remain in Pakistan are strongly urged to register and
obtain updated security information at the U.S. Embassy or Consulates listed
in the Registration/Embassy Location section near the end of this document.
COUNTRY DESCRIPTION:  Pakistan is a developing country.  Its elected
government was overthrown by the military in October 1999, and it is now
ruled by President Pervez Musharraf and an appointed civilian cabinet.
ENTRY/EXIT REQUIREMENTS:  A passport is required.  All U.S. citizens
traveling to Pakistan are required to have valid visas issued at a Pakistani
Embassy or Consulate.  Other information on entry requirements can be
obtained from the Embassy of Pakistan, 2315 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, DC, 20008, telephone (202)939-6295 or 6261, Internet home page:
  Travelers may also contact one of the
Consulates General of Pakistan located at
12 East 65th St., New York, NY 10021, telephone (212)879-5800, fax
(212)517-6987, or 10850 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1100, Los Angeles, CA 90024,
telephone (310)441-5114, fax (310)441-9256.  If a traveler plans to stay
longer than the time listed on the visa, he or she must extend the stay with
the local passport office of Ministry of Interior.  Airlines may require
travelers departing the United States to present multiple photographs and
complete copies of passports and other travel documents.  Tourist facilities
are available in the principal population centers of the country.
In an effort to prevent international child abduction, many governments have
initiated procedures at entry/exit points.  These often include requiring
documentary evidence of relationship and permission for the child's travel
from the parent(s) or legal guardian not present.  Having such documentation
on hand, even if not required, may facilitate entry/departure.
SAFETY/SECURITY/AREAS OF INSTABILITY:  Bombings continue to occur throughout
Pakistan with frequency.  Bombs have exploded in public markets, on a train,
at a bus station and in other public venues during the past year causing
numerous casualties.  Two Americans were killed and several more were
injured in a church bombing on March 17, 2002.  Rallies, demonstrations and
processions occur from time to time throughout Pakistan on very short notice
and have occasionally taken on an anti-American or anti-Western character.
Karachi and the southern parts of Punjab province have experienced
protracted political or sectarian violence that, although not explicitly
anti-American, poses a potential danger to American travelers.  During the
Islamic religious observance of Moharram, sectarian rivalry and violence
often increase.  Family feuds are frequently fatal and may be followed by
retaliation.  Women do not walk out alone and it is not wise to travel in
the streets late at night.  Travelers may wish to maintain a low profile,
blend in, and seek security in the traveler's family or sponsoring
organization.  An American citizen reporter was kidnapped and killed in
Karachi in January 2002 after being lured from a public place to a private
Northern Areas - Visitors wishing to trek in Gilgit, Hunza, Chitral and the
upper Swat valley should use only licensed guides and tourist agencies.
There have been occasional assaults, and in 1998, a U.S. tourist who was not
accompanied by a guide was murdered in Gilgit.
Northwest Frontier Province - The Government of Pakistan requires all
citizens of countries other than Pakistan and Afghanistan to obtain
permission from the Home and Tribal Affairs Department prior to visiting
these tribal areas, which lie outside the normal jurisdiction of the
Government of Pakistan.  Substantial areas within the Northwest Frontier
Province are designated tribal areas and are outside the normal jurisdiction
of government law enforcement authorities.  If visitors must enter the
tribal areas, a permit from the Home and Tribal Affairs Department is
required.  The permit may stipulate that an armed escort must accompany the
visitor.  Even in the settled areas of the Northwest Frontier Province,
there is occasional ethnic, sectarian, and political violence as well as
anti-foreign rhetoric; foreigners should steer clear of such demonstrations
or known areas of conflict.  However, the periodic steam train excursion for
tourists from Peshawar through the Khyber Pass is well protected by local
Kashmir:  Military operations continue along the Line of Control in Kashmir,
and military exchanges between Pakistani and Indian forces often result in
deaths and injuries on both sides.  Militant groups, some of whom have made
anti-American statements, are active in the area.  Many areas are
restricted.  Americans planning travel in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir should
contact the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad prior to travel in the area and assure
that they have taken appropriate security precautions.  Americans should
defer travel to Kashmir and the Pakistan - India border areas at this time.
The Wagah border crossing into India near Lahore remains open (from 9:30
a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) for travel to and from India if the passport holder has a
valid visa for either country.  Travelers are advised to confirm the current
status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel.  An American and
other Westerners were kidnapped in Indian-controlled Kashmir in 1995 and
have never been found.
Punjab Province - Sectarian violence decreased considerably in recent years,
although there continue to be isolated attacks on places of worship of all
faiths.  While Americans are not targets of this violence, the foreign
community is not immune, as evidenced by the 1997 assassination of five
Iranians in an attack widely believed to have had sectarian overtones.  As a
precaution against possible dangers resulting from sectarian violence, U.S.
citizens are cautioned to avoid public transportation and crowded areas.
Sindh Province - In the areas of Karachi and Hyderabad there have been
recurring outbreaks of ethnic and sectarian violence characterized by random
bombings, shootings and demonstrations.  These have resulted in deaths and
the imposition of curfews.  There have also been numerous incidents of
kidnappings for ransom.  In rural Sindh Province, the security situation is
hazardous, especially in regard to overland travel.  Foreigners have
occasionally been kidnapped or killed, most notably an American citizen
reporter who was kidnapped and murdered in Karachi in early 2002.  In 1997,
four U.S. businessmen and their driver were also murdered in Karachi.  In
1995, employees from the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi were murdered on
their way to work.  The Government of Pakistan has recommended that
travelers limit their movements in Sindh Province to the city of Karachi.
If visitors must go into the interior of Sindh Province, the Government of
Pakistan requests that travelers inform police authorities well in advance
of the trip so that necessary police security arrangements can be made.
Baluchistan Province - The province of Baluchistan, which borders both Iran
and Afghanistan, is notorious for cross-border smuggling.  Armed battles
between clans are frequent.  Because provincial police presence is limited,
travelers wishing to visit the interior of Baluchistan should consult with
the province's Home Secretary.  Advance permission from provincial
authorities is required for travel into some areas.  Local authorities have
detained travelers who lack permission.  Quetta, the provincial capital, has
experienced serious ethnic violence that has led to gun battles in the
streets and the imposition of curfews.
Returning Americans of Afghan origin are sometimes targets for harassment
for extortion by the local populace and even by police, local immigration
and customs officials--especially if they do not have a well-established
family structure in Pakistan.
CRIME:  Crime is a serious concern for foreigners throughout Pakistan, with
violent crime increasing faster than any other category.  Carjackings, armed
robberies, house invasions and other violence against civilians have
increased steadily in the major urban areas.  Lahore and Karachi, in
particular, experience high levels of crime.  They are large cities beset by
poverty, high unemployment, and underpaid, under-manned police forces.
Travelers in Karachi are encouraged to use hotel shuttles from the airport
rather than taxis, which are subject to police harassment, especially after
dark.  Petty crime, especially theft of personal property, is common
throughout Pakistan.
The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be reported immediately
to local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  U.S. citizens
may refer to the Department of State pamphlets,
"A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to South Asia," for ways to
promote a more trouble-free journey.  The pamphlets are available by mail
from the Superintendent of Documents,
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, via the Internet at
 or via the Bureau of Consular Affairs
home page at MEDICAL FACILITIES:  Adequate medical care is available in major cities in
Pakistan, but it is limited in rural areas.  With the exception of the Agha
Khan Hospital in Karachi and Doctors' Hospital in Lahore, Americans may find
hospital care and cleanliness below U.S. standards.  Medical facilities
often require prepayment and do not accept credit cards.
MEDICAL INSURANCE:  The Department of State strongly urges Americans to
consult with their medical insurance company prior to traveling abroad to
confirm whether their policy applies overseas and if it will cover emergency
expenses such as a medical evacuation.  U.S. medical insurance plans seldom
cover health costs incurred outside the United States unless supplemental
coverage is purchased.  Further, U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not
provide payment for medical services outside the United States.  However,
many travel agents and private companies offer insurance plans that will
cover health care expenses incurred overseas, including emergency services
such as medical evacuations.
When making a decision regarding health insurance, Americans should consider
that many foreign doctors and hospitals require payment in cash prior to
providing service and that a medical evacuation to the United States may
cost more than $50,000.  Uninsured travelers who require medical care
overseas often face extreme difficulties, whereas travelers who have
purchased overseas medical insurance have found it to be life-saving when a
medical emergency has occurred.  When consulting with your insurer prior to
your trip, please ascertain whether payment will be made to the overseas
healthcare provider or if you will be reimbursed later for expenses that you
incur.  Some insurance policies also include coverage for psychiatric
treatment and for disposition of remains in the event of death.
Useful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas
insurance programs, is provided in the Department of State's Bureau of
Consular Affairs brochure, "Medical Information for Americans Traveling
Abroad," available via the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page or autofax:
(202) 647-3000.
OTHER HEALTH INFORMATION:  The water is not potable anywhere in Pakistan,
and sanitation in many restaurants is inadequate.  Stomach illnesses are
frequent and dangerous.  Information on vaccinations and other health
precautions may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's hotline for international travelers from the United States at
(1-877-394-8747); fax: 1-888-CDC-FAXX (1-888-232-3299), or via the CDC's
Internet site at TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS:  While in a foreign country, U.S.
citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those
in the United States.  The information below concerning traffic safety and
road conditions in Pakistan is provided for general reference only, and it
may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance
Safety of Public Transportation:             Poor
Urban Road Condition/Maintenance:     Good to Poor
Rural Road condition/Maintenance:       Poor
Availability of Roadside Assistance:      Poor
Road travel in Pakistan is risky.  Roads are crowded, drivers are aggressive
and poorly trained, and many vehicles, particularly large trucks and buses,
are badly maintained.  Roads, including most major highways, also suffer
from poor maintenance and often have numerous potholes, sharp drop-offs and
barriers that are not sign-posted.  Extreme caution should be exercised when
traveling at night by road since many vehicles do not have proper
illumination or dimmers nor are most roads properly illuminated or sign
posted.  Driving without experienced local drivers or guides is not
For additional information about road safety, please see the Department of
State, Bureau of Consular Affairs home page at
AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
has assessed the Government of Pakistan's civil aviation authority as
Category 1 -- in compliance with international aviation safety standards for
oversight of Pakistan's air carrier operations.
For further information, travelers may contact the Department of
Transportation within the United States at tel. 1-800-322-7873, or visit the
FAA's Internet web site at   The U.S. Department
of Defense (DOD) separately assesses some foreign carriers for suitability
as official providers of air services.  For information regarding the DOD
policy on specific carriers, travelers may contact the DOD at tel.
CUSTOMS REGULATIONS:  Import of firearms, pornographic material and alcohol
is restricted.  An import permit and health certificate are required for
animals.  There are also restrictions on leaving Pakistan with antiquities
or animals.  It is advisable to contact the Pakistani Embassy in Washington,
D.C. or the nearest Pakistani consulate for specific information regarding
customs requirements.
CRIMINAL PENALTIES:  While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject
to that country's laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly
from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available
to the individual under U.S. law.  Penalties for breaking the law can be
more severe than in the United States for similar offenses.  Persons
violating Pakistani laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or
imprisoned.  Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs
are strictly enforced.  Long jail sentences are frequently imposed, and
large fines are assessed in some cases.  Legislation passed in 1994 makes
trafficking offenses punishable by death.
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:  Pakistan is largely a cash economy.  Personal checks
are not commonly accepted.  Most Pakistanis do not use checking accounts for
routine transactions.  Only a few establishments in the larger cities accept
credit cards and traveler's checks, and there have been numerous reports of
credit card fraud.  There are bank branches as well as registered
moneychangers in all international airports.  ATMs are usually not found in
airports.  English is widely spoken by professional level airport staff.  It
is best to agree on taxi fares before hiring a driver.  Currently,
U.S. Embassy employees are restricted from using taxis for security reasons.
CHILDREN'S ISSUES:  For information on international adoption of children
and international parental child abduction, please refer to our Internet
site at  or telephone
REGISTRATION/EMBASSY AND CONSULATE LOCATIONS:  American citizens living in
or visiting Pakistan are encouraged to register at the Consular Section of
the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in Pakistan and obtain updated information on
travel and security within Pakistan.  They are located at the following

In particular, I've tried to be more clear about the magnitude of Mojo Nation's failures by adding the typical and maximum number of simultaneously connected nodes.
I've also added some observations about "two big mistakes that would be easy to correct", something I understood only after chatting with the researchers at the Peer-to-Peer Workshop.
I've also attempted to address A. Melon's other criticism: that it isn't clear which specific issues are most to blame for the overall poor behavior.  I've added statements about my belief that the high node churn rate was largely due to the poor data availability and that conversely the poor data availability was partially due to the high node churn rate.  I've also added a statement that there are a lot of important aspects of the system as a whole which are omitted from the scope of the paper.  (Including agnostically-blindable digital tokens and many other things.)
I'd like to thank A. Melon and the participants of the Peer-to-Peer workshop for feedback.  Most of all I'd like to thank the architects of Mojo Nation: Jim McCoy and Doug Barnes.  Mojo Nation was a brave experiment, and I hope that we will all benefit from the resulting knowledge.

@_subject: RE: crypto question - using crypto to protect financial transactions (fwd) 
Reply-To: amir
    cryptography
I understand the goal of allowing secure and anonymous financial
transactions via the Net. I'm personally very interetested in this,
although I must admit I am also a bit concerned about the social
implications if this becomes a reality (or when it does, since I believe
it eventually will). What I'm concerned about is tax avoidance, esp. by
wealthy individuals and companies. Nobody likes taxation (at least
personally :-), but it is still the basis for operation of states - and
while changes may be good, they are also risky. Anyway, forgetting for a moment the question of should we do it, let's
focus on the question of how we do it :-) I looked up Andrew's site, and actually there're not too many details
there (yet?). I think his initial focus and question was on the issue of
whether one can trust one's public key to the financial server, and his
answer seems to be, you can if you split the key between several servers
using thershold or proactive signatures (proactive schemes allow
recovery from penetrations of servers - and btw, this is an area
deserving more implmentation efforts, beyond what we did in IBM). I think there may be even more critical hurdles for successful financial
crypto services. A very important one is interoperability between
different financial service providers (the companies that keep your
money... E.g. banks). Most crypto-financial efforts so far focused on a
centralized model - one bank - and that's much easier to design, but
very hard to succeed. I've done some work on secure interoperability
among providers - it was actually the main feature of IBM Micro
Payments. IBM have also applied for patent for some of the ideas. Another important issue is the automated management of trust and
reputation, allowing customers to make (automated) trust decisions on
providers of services and goods (including both financial services and
merchants). Here I agree with Andrew that for many applications,
financial transactions should not be reversible (disputed), and hence
trust and reputation becomes the main means for consumer protection. Regards, Amir Herzberg

draft-chapters from book-in-progress, `secure communication and commerce

University of Essen, Essen, Waterloo
September 23, 24 & 25 2002
First Announcement		April 5, 2002
ECC 2002 is the sixth in a series of annual workshops dedicated to the
study of elliptic curve cryptography and related areas. The main themes
of ECC 2002 will be:
   - The discrete logarithm and elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems.
   - Efficient parameter generation and point counting.
   - Provably secure cryptographic protocols for encryption, signatures
     and key agreement.
   - Efficient software and hardware implementation of elliptic curve
     cryptosystems.
   - Deployment of elliptic curve cryptography.
It is hoped that the meeting will continue to encourage and stimulate
further research on the security and implementation of elliptic curve
cryptosystems and related areas, and encourage collaboration between
mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers in the academic,
industry and government sectors.
There will be approximately 15 invited lectures (and no contributed

@_subject: [9fans] Call for Papers - 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 2002) ( 
Reply-To: 9fans
The 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '02) will take place December 9-11, 2002 at the Boston Park Plaza in Boston, Massachusetts and we would like to encourage your participation.
OSDI 2002 will bring together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software.
Paper submissions are due on May 17, 2002. This is a hard deadline --
no extensions will be given. Submission guidelines are available on our Web site: Emphasizing both innovative research and quantified experience, OSDI takes a broad view of what the systems area encompasses and solicits contributions from all fields of systems practice including, but not limited to: operating systems, networking, storage, distributed systems, parallel systems, mobile systems, embedded systems, the influence of hardware development on systems and vice-versa. We particularly encourage contributions containing highly original ideas or ground-breaking results that push the systems frontier.
The symposium will consist of 2.5 days of single-track technical sessions with presentations of refereed papers and a keynote address.
A session of Work-in-Progress presentations is planned, and informal Birds-of-a-Feather sessions may be organized by attendees. We look forward to receiving your submissions.

                     If it's inclimate but not overly cold we meet in the                      outside covered section. Otherwise look for us inside

Sorry, we have a spoofer using a system in Canada who for some reason has
decided they want to 'teach me a lesson', coupled with the fact they
don't have much else to do (like a job)...of course they are too self-rightous to review their own actions and motives , typical
CACL 'freedom for me, but not for thee'.
I've contacted the ISP (helpdesk and asked for for their help
in shutting this idiot down. If any of the rest of you feel board feel
free to bang on their help desk...I've included them as a recipient to
this email. I guess if I keep getting them I'll build myself a little
procmail script and start bouncing (with a suitable warning pre-pended so
there is no DoS or harrassment issue)...
If you compare the header for this email with one of the spoofs the diff
is obvious. If nothing else I have to thank them for finding a hole in the
security for majordomo since it looks at the To: field and doesn't verify
the original source of the email.

Sent: March 29, 2002 1:02 PM
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman
For Immediate Release
March 29, 2002
On-The-Record Briefing
Secretary Of State Colin L. Powell
March 29, 2002
Washington, D.C.
(12:45 p.m. EST)
SECRETARY POWELL:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  The President
and his national security team have been following the very serious
situation in the Middle East since last night.  Early this morning we
began a National Security Council meeting which included the President
via television remote, as well as the Vice President, the Secretary of
Defense, myself of course, the Director of Central Intelligence Mr.
Tenet, National Security Advisor Rice and Chief of Staff Andy Card.
Last night also I was in a conference call with the President and Dr.
Rice to review the situation, and immediately after talking to the
President I also had the opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Sharon,
who is in the middle of a cabinet meeting, as you know, in Israel.  In
that conversation with Prime Minister Sharon, he advised me that the
cabinet was meeting to decide what action the Israeli Government should
take in response to the recent spate of terror incidents, and he also
advised me that of whatever actions they might decide to take, it would
not include bringing any harm to Chairman Arafat or killing him.  And
subsequent statements by Israeli officials suggest that it is not their
intention either to capture him.
They have determined to isolate him and, as you know, Israeli Defense
Forces are now operating in Ramallah and there has been a significant
call-up of Israeli Defense Forces.  I have a call in to Chairman Arafat
and hope I will have a chance to reach him right after this press
conference.  General Zinni remains in the region, and he and our
diplomatic representatives in the region are in touch with both Israeli
and Palestinian officials.  General Zinni did speak to Chairman Arafat
earlier today.
Once again, terrorism -- terrorism that targets innocent civilians --
has dealt a serious blow to the effort to achieve a cease-fire, and to
find a political solution to the crisis in the Middle East.  Once again,
terrorists have set back the vision of the Palestinian people for a
state that would live in peace side by side with Israel.  The United
States government condemns these acts of terror, and those responsible
for them.
In recent weeks, there was cause for some guarded optimism.  As you
know, beginning last fall the President put down his vision at the
United Nations for a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with
a Jewish state, Israel.  We also saw positive reaction to the speech
that I gave in Louisville, and then just a couple of weeks ago, the
United Nations passed an important Security Council resolution,
introduced by the United States.  And it went through the Security
Council in a record period of time -- with a vote of 14-0 and only one
abstention, Syria -- calling for a state for the Palestinian people.
The Arab summit in Beirut earlier this week, while it did not provide a
complete solution, it laid out a vision, a bold vision, what was put
forward by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.  And it was embraced
by all of the Arab nations.  Prime Minister Sharon in recent weeks
showed a great deal of flexibility with respect to conditions he had
previously held to with respect to what it would take to get into the
Tenet work plan.  Both sides welcomed General Zinni's return to get the
Tenet work plan started, which would then lead to the Mitchell process
and the political solution, the political discussions and negotiations
that we all are hoping for.  The Vice President paid a trip to the
region and was prepared to see Chairman Arafat if circumstances had
So there was reason for guarded optimism.  And let's be clear about what
brought it all to a halt:  terrorism.  Terrorism on the part of those
who would target innocent civilians.  Innocent civilians going about
their daily lives -- shopping, trying to assemble in a restaurant to
celebrate an important occasion in their religious life.  That it what
has caused this crisis to come upon us -- not the absence of a political
way forward, but terrorism in its rawest form.
The President, I, all my colleagues, the United States people condemn in
the strongest possible terms this series of terror attacks, including
this morning's Jerusalem bombings and the other acts of terrorism which
have killed innocent Israeli civilians.
We have spoken out clearly, and do so again now, for Chairman Arafat to
act, act against those responsible for these acts and to make clear to
the Palestinian people that terror and violence must halt now.  All
those who support peace must reinforce this message.  The international
community is delivering this message.  I ask Arab nations to deliver
this message.  I ask my colleagues in the European Union and nations
around the world to deliver this powerful message.
The President and I are gravely concerned at the situation today in
Ramallah.  We deplore the killing and wounding of innocent Palestinians
there.  While we understand the Israeli Government need to respond to
these acts of terror and the right of the Israeli Government to decide
what actions best serve the interests of the Israeli people, we call on
Prime Minister Sharon and his government to carefully consider the
consequences of those actions.
Chairman Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people, and his
leadership is now even more central to trying to find a way out of this
tragic situation.  In addition to Prime Minister Sharon, I will be in
touch and have been in touch already, but will continue to be touch in
the course of the day and the weekend, with other Arab leaders besides
those that I have already been in touch with, as well as the European
Union, and I will be placing a call also to the United Nations Secretary
General Mr. Kofi Annan.
At this critical moment, we call upon our friends throughout the
international community to condemn terror unequivocally.  We cannot lose
sight of our goal.  Despite the tragedy we see unfolding now on this
holy week, we must not lose sight of the goal.  We have to achieve an
enduring and comprehensive peace for Arabs and Israelis alike.  This is
the future.  This is what we must achieve.  And although things look
dark now, we must have hope and we must continue to work, and work hard.
General Zinni, for that reason, will remain in the region.  He received
a commitment in principle from the Israeli Government to move forward
into the Tenet work plan on the basis of the proposal put down by
General Zinni.  I think we were close to getting a similar commitment
from the Palestinian side when these acts of terror disrupted the whole
process.  And we will see what happens in the days ahead.
The United States Government will be examining this situation in the
days ahead to see what other steps we might take, and I can assure you
that President Bush and his national security advisors will be following
this on an hour-by-hour basis.
Thank you.
QUESTION:  Secretary Powell, your comments were rather long on criticism
on Chairman Arafat but rather short on what you think about the Israeli
actions in Ramallah, particularly the strafing of Chairman Arafat's
headquarters and, in fact, the occupation -- the reoccupation -- itself.
Are you looking for the Israelis to withdraw from Ramallah?
SECRETARY POWELL:  The Israelis have said to me that it is not their
intention to occupy any of these areas -- and the only are that they are
in at the moment is Ramallah -- for some extended period.  They are
going in to find terrorists, to pick up weapons, and it is not their
intention to occupy these places on any long-term basis.  We ask the
Israelis to show the necessary restraint with respect to that activity,
so that they do not put Chairman Arafat's life in danger, and they
minimize loss of life with respect to civilians.
It's a very difficult situation.  Israel is trying to defend itself.  We
had a process moving forward; we had some success over the past week or
two.  And then suddenly, the bombing of the night before last, the
bombing again today, the random shootings, the murder of Israeli
citizens; all -- all -- all done by terrorists who do not want to see
peace.  They don't want to see a solution to this problem.  They are
determined to destroy this process, and we must not let them.  We have
to keep working, and work hard.
QUESTION:  Do you suppose any of the accomplishments of General Zinni in
the past few days are salvageable?  Or does he have to start from
SECRETARY POWELL:  I don't know; we'll have to wait and see.  General
Zinni was quite encouraged by the progress he was making up until we had
the massacre the other night.  And so we'll have to wait and see what
the days ahead bring.  But we're going to continue to work hard to see
if we can bring some stability and order to this, and then move forward.
People are always asking, don't you need a political answer to this?
Don't you need a political process?  The political process is there,
staring us in the face.  It's contained in the Mitchell plan.  It's
contained in a commitment on the part of both sides to enter
negotiations on the basis of 242 and 338 as you go through Mitchell.
But nothing can get started, no political process can take hold, in the
presence of this kind of continued terrorist activity.
One more, and then I have to leave.
QUESTION:  Sir, some might say that extraordinary circumstances call for
extraordinary measures.  And what you've outlined today seems to be
keeping your envoy in the region and making phone calls from here.  I
wonder if you can describe whether anything beyond that -- what is being
contemplated?  What kind of steps -- for example, buffer forces, troops,
peacekeepers, a more physical personal diplomacy?  A trip to the region
by yourself, for example?
SECRETARY POWELL:  Well, there is nothing we are not considering.  I
mean, personal diplomacy, we just had the Vice President out there
talking to everybody in the region and trying to help in this difficult
situation.  We're not ruling anything out.
But I'm not prepared to make any announcements right now.  I'm willing
to go when there is a reason to go and a purpose to be served.
Thank you.

Don't miss Kenneth Timmerman's Insight Exclusive on the Iraq connection to the Oklahoma City bombing. We just posted it, Friday morning.
Insight has learned that the widow of Philippine-government intelligence agent Edwin Angeles has provided audiotaped testimony to an investigator working for the American victims' families that directly ties Iraqi intelligence agents to Terry Nichols, the man sentenced in 1998 to life in prison for his role in bombing the Alfred P. Murrah Building seven years ago.
Elmina Abdul is the 27-year-old widow of Angeles, one of the cofounders of the Abu Sayyaf group, a Muslim separatist terrorist organization in the Philippines whose members trained in Osama bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Her astonishing story, revealed in this exclusive story for the first time, could blow the lid off what a growing number of people believe is a U.S. government cover-up of vital evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing case.

It is about visualizing any sort of relationship, not just mathematics.
Category Theory has a lot to say about the 'simplicity' of the cosmos. It
also has a lot to say (in a self-referential manner) about the way humans
think about thinking. It will, in the long run, be a critical component in
developing AI.
Actualy it's very useful, it even leads into CT if you keep at it.
Diffusion may be -fractal-, but that is not the same as -chaotic-. You're
confusing the two.

not from any generalization of the analytical process.

Sent: March 29, 2002 1:02 PM
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman
For Immediate Release
March 29, 2002
On-The-Record Briefing
Secretary Of State Colin L. Powell
March 29, 2002
Washington, D.C.
(12:45 p.m. EST)
SECRETARY POWELL:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  The President
and his national security team have been following the very serious
situation in the Middle East since last night.  Early this morning we
began a National Security Council meeting which included the President
via television remote, as well as the Vice President, the Secretary of
Defense, myself of course, the Director of Central Intelligence Mr.
Tenet, National Security Advisor Rice and Chief of Staff Andy Card.
Last night also I was in a conference call with the President and Dr.
Rice to review the situation, and immediately after talking to the
President I also had the opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Sharon,
who is in the middle of a cabinet meeting, as you know, in Israel.  In
that conversation with Prime Minister Sharon, he advised me that the
cabinet was meeting to decide what action the Israeli Government should
take in response to the recent spate of terror incidents, and he also
advised me that of whatever actions they might decide to take, it would
not include bringing any harm to Chairman Arafat or killing him.  And
subsequent statements by Israeli officials suggest that it is not their
intention either to capture him.
They have determined to isolate him and, as you know, Israeli Defense
Forces are now operating in Ramallah and there has been a significant
call-up of Israeli Defense Forces.  I have a call in to Chairman Arafat
and hope I will have a chance to reach him right after this press
conference.  General Zinni remains in the region, and he and our
diplomatic representatives in the region are in touch with both Israeli
and Palestinian officials.  General Zinni did speak to Chairman Arafat
earlier today.
Once again, terrorism -- terrorism that targets innocent civilians --
has dealt a serious blow to the effort to achieve a cease-fire, and to
find a political solution to the crisis in the Middle East.  Once again,
terrorists have set back the vision of the Palestinian people for a
state that would live in peace side by side with Israel.  The United
States government condemns these acts of terror, and those responsible
for them.
In recent weeks, there was cause for some guarded optimism.  As you
know, beginning last fall the President put down his vision at the
United Nations for a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with
a Jewish state, Israel.  We also saw positive reaction to the speech
that I gave in Louisville, and then just a couple of weeks ago, the
United Nations passed an important Security Council resolution,
introduced by the United States.  And it went through the Security
Council in a record period of time -- with a vote of 14-0 and only one
abstention, Syria -- calling for a state for the Palestinian people.
The Arab summit in Beirut earlier this week, while it did not provide a
complete solution, it laid out a vision, a bold vision, what was put
forward by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.  And it was embraced
by all of the Arab nations.  Prime Minister Sharon in recent weeks
showed a great deal of flexibility with respect to conditions he had
previously held to with respect to what it would take to get into the
Tenet work plan.  Both sides welcomed General Zinni's return to get the
Tenet work plan started, which would then lead to the Mitchell process
and the political solution, the political discussions and negotiations
that we all are hoping for.  The Vice President paid a trip to the
region and was prepared to see Chairman Arafat if circumstances had
So there was reason for guarded optimism.  And let's be clear about what
brought it all to a halt:  terrorism.  Terrorism on the part of those
who would target innocent civilians.  Innocent civilians going about
their daily lives -- shopping, trying to assemble in a restaurant to
celebrate an important occasion in their religious life.  That it what
has caused this crisis to come upon us -- not the absence of a political
way forward, but terrorism in its rawest form.
The President, I, all my colleagues, the United States people condemn in
the strongest possible terms this series of terror attacks, including
this morning's Jerusalem bombings and the other acts of terrorism which
have killed innocent Israeli civilians.
We have spoken out clearly, and do so again now, for Chairman Arafat to
act, act against those responsible for these acts and to make clear to
the Palestinian people that terror and violence must halt now.  All
those who support peace must reinforce this message.  The international
community is delivering this message.  I ask Arab nations to deliver
this message.  I ask my colleagues in the European Union and nations
around the world to deliver this powerful message.
The President and I are gravely concerned at the situation today in
Ramallah.  We deplore the killing and wounding of innocent Palestinians
there.  While we understand the Israeli Government need to respond to
these acts of terror and the right of the Israeli Government to decide
what actions best serve the interests of the Israeli people, we call on
Prime Minister Sharon and his government to carefully consider the
consequences of those actions.
Chairman Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people, and his
leadership is now even more central to trying to find a way out of this
tragic situation.  In addition to Prime Minister Sharon, I will be in
touch and have been in touch already, but will continue to be touch in
the course of the day and the weekend, with other Arab leaders besides
those that I have already been in touch with, as well as the European
Union, and I will be placing a call also to the United Nations Secretary
General Mr. Kofi Annan.
At this critical moment, we call upon our friends throughout the
international community to condemn terror unequivocally.  We cannot lose
sight of our goal.  Despite the tragedy we see unfolding now on this
holy week, we must not lose sight of the goal.  We have to achieve an
enduring and comprehensive peace for Arabs and Israelis alike.  This is
the future.  This is what we must achieve.  And although things look
dark now, we must have hope and we must continue to work, and work hard.
General Zinni, for that reason, will remain in the region.  He received
a commitment in principle from the Israeli Government to move forward
into the Tenet work plan on the basis of the proposal put down by
General Zinni.  I think we were close to getting a similar commitment
from the Palestinian side when these acts of terror disrupted the whole
process.  And we will see what happens in the days ahead.
The United States Government will be examining this situation in the
days ahead to see what other steps we might take, and I can assure you
that President Bush and his national security advisors will be following
this on an hour-by-hour basis.
Thank you.
QUESTION:  Secretary Powell, your comments were rather long on criticism
on Chairman Arafat but rather short on what you think about the Israeli
actions in Ramallah, particularly the strafing of Chairman Arafat's
headquarters and, in fact, the occupation -- the reoccupation -- itself.
Are you looking for the Israelis to withdraw from Ramallah?
SECRETARY POWELL:  The Israelis have said to me that it is not their
intention to occupy any of these areas -- and the only are that they are
in at the moment is Ramallah -- for some extended period.  They are
going in to find terrorists, to pick up weapons, and it is not their
intention to occupy these places on any long-term basis.  We ask the
Israelis to show the necessary restraint with respect to that activity,
so that they do not put Chairman Arafat's life in danger, and they
minimize loss of life with respect to civilians.
It's a very difficult situation.  Israel is trying to defend itself.  We
had a process moving forward; we had some success over the past week or
two.  And then suddenly, the bombing of the night before last, the
bombing again today, the random shootings, the murder of Israeli
citizens; all -- all -- all done by terrorists who do not want to see
peace.  They don't want to see a solution to this problem.  They are
determined to destroy this process, and we must not let them.  We have
to keep working, and work hard.
QUESTION:  Do you suppose any of the accomplishments of General Zinni in
the past few days are salvageable?  Or does he have to start from
SECRETARY POWELL:  I don't know; we'll have to wait and see.  General
Zinni was quite encouraged by the progress he was making up until we had
the massacre the other night.  And so we'll have to wait and see what
the days ahead bring.  But we're going to continue to work hard to see
if we can bring some stability and order to this, and then move forward.
People are always asking, don't you need a political answer to this?
Don't you need a political process?  The political process is there,
staring us in the face.  It's contained in the Mitchell plan.  It's
contained in a commitment on the part of both sides to enter
negotiations on the basis of 242 and 338 as you go through Mitchell.
But nothing can get started, no political process can take hold, in the
presence of this kind of continued terrorist activity.
One more, and then I have to leave.
QUESTION:  Sir, some might say that extraordinary circumstances call for
extraordinary measures.  And what you've outlined today seems to be
keeping your envoy in the region and making phone calls from here.  I
wonder if you can describe whether anything beyond that -- what is being
contemplated?  What kind of steps -- for example, buffer forces, troops,
peacekeepers, a more physical personal diplomacy?  A trip to the region
by yourself, for example?
SECRETARY POWELL:  Well, there is nothing we are not considering.  I
mean, personal diplomacy, we just had the Vice President out there
talking to everybody in the region and trying to help in this difficult
situation.  We're not ruling anything out.
But I'm not prepared to make any announcements right now.  I'm willing
to go when there is a reason to go and a purpose to be served.
Thank you.

Incorrect, she trusts money because she knows the vendor trusts the money.
Why? Because they are members in a large (reasonably) stable environment
with (relatively) low threat percentages. If it's too hairy the ice cream
man moves on down the road, and the price of bread is so high that nobody worries about ice cream. Try to buy ice cream in a combat zone.
No, they exchange bits based on a very expensive and complicated protocol
that has a variety of safe guards built into it.
The medium is -not- the message. There -is- context. What message does a
telegraph send if the key isn't struck? Cleary the medium in and of itself
can't be the message. What does the message "Billy arrived" mean, if
context isn't important? Does it mean that the killer arrived on time,
that your a grandparent, or that your dog just got to the vet?
This means that yes, -some- bits -are- more special than others.
You and Tim are incorrect in your view. And yes, the question of whether
trust (is) -not- transitive is -especially- critical. It is an -emotional-
measure of the social stability of the populace at large. If people don't
trust they don't -cooperate- and this adds 'friction' to the system. It's
sort of like the PVT gas law coupled with materials science (in particular
failure mode analysis) with respect to when or if the society will 'pop'.
It maps (at least parametrically) to temperature (trust that is).

@_subject: objectivity and factoring analysis (fwd) 
I'd just like to make a few comments about the apparently unnoticed or
unstated conflicts of interest and bias in the analysis surrounding
Bernstein's proposal.
The following is not intended to trample on anyone's ego -- but I
think deserves saying.
- I'm not sure any of the respondents so far except Bernstein have
truly understood the math -- there are probably few who do, factoring
being such a narrow research area.
- Dan Bernstein stated that it is not easy to estimate the constants
involved to know whether the asymptotic result affects currently used
key sizes; he stated that the conclusion should be considered unknown
until experimental evidence is gained.
- Nicko van Someren -- the person credited with originally making the
exaggerated, or at least highly worst case interpretation at the FC02
panel -- has a conflict interest -- hardware accelerator gear that
ncipher sell will be more markedly needed if people switch to 2048 or
larger keys.  Nicko has made no public comments in the resulting
- Ian Goldberg also on the panel quickly distanced himself from van
Someren's claim, as Lucky's earlier mail could have been read to imply
Goldberg had also agreed with van Someren's claim.
- RSA's FAQ down playing the result seems relatively balanced though
they have an incentive to downplay the potential of Bernstein's
approach.  They have a history of producing biased FAQs: for example
previously the ECC FAQ where they compared ECC unfavorably to RSA.
The FAQ was removed after they licensed tech from certicom and
included ECC in BSAFE.
- Bob Silverman, former RSA factoring expert, observes on sci.crypt,
- Bruce Schneier's somewhat downplaying comments, as far as I know
Bruce isn't an expert on factoring and he doesn't credit anyone who is
in his report.  Bruce's comments lately seem to have lost much of
their earlier objectivity -- many of his security newsletters lately
seem to contain healthy doses of adverts for counterpane's managed
security offering, and calls for lobbying and laws requiring companies
to use such products for insurance eligibility.
- Lucky on the other hand suggested a practical security engineering
approach to start to plan for possibility of migrating to larger key
sizes.  Already one SSH implementation added a configuration option to
select a minimum key size accepted by servers as a result.  This seems
like a positive outcome.  Generally the suggestion to move to 2048 bit
keys seems like a good idea to me.  Somewhat like MD5 -> SHA1, MD5
isn't broken for most applications but it is potentially tainted by a
partial result.  Similarly I would concur with Lucky that it's prudent
security engineering to use 2048 bit keys in new systems.
Historically for example PGP has had similar migrations from minimum
listed key sizes for casual use from 512 -> 768 -> 1024 over the
years.  The progression to 2048 is probably not a bad idea given
current entry level computer speeds and possibility of Bernstein's
approach yeilding an improvement in factoring.
The mocking tone of recent posts about Lucky's call seems quite
misplaced given the checkered bias and questionable authority of the
above conflicting claims we've seen quoted.

There are, AND they are continous and -not- based on NOT-AND-OR. I

algorithms won't run on a digital computer without losing precision which

Pi -is- a pretty lousy seed for anything. You are of course welcome to cut
your own head off any time you want any way you want. I'll be a tad more
cautious and considerate of the future and unknowns.
Unhuh, keep telling yourself that...
 - my point concerned repeated sequences, not If you don't understand the importance of k-distribution to what a RNG can
do then  you don't know as much as you think. You should perhaps read
Knuths blathering on the subject, you might learn something.
There is no solution to the Halting Problem, silly goose. And that you
think there could be is a prime example of the level you operate at.
Peter, as usual, you're full of shit.

Comments inline...
This is called 'bifurcation'...a mathematician should know that.
This person should start with Mandelbrots book....x=(x^2)+1 is
'deterministic' as well...but their is a catch to this...
You -can't, even in -principle-, know the precision to finite levels. This
is the entire basis for chaos theory.
The selection of a special analysis point to prove a general behaviour of
the function is a logical fallicy.
Probably not, in general (there is a special name for this distribution
but I don't remember and I've got four days mail to catch up on) but the
numbers, [0...9], do -not- appear in nature in equal distribution. If you
are basing anything on this then you're in for a world of hurt.
Actually that's overly general. Other keys could generate that sequence

You (and others I'm sure) seem to miss the point.
I am -not- saying that -all- applications -want- a RNG. Why?
Repeatability. One of the two factors that describe a PRNG.
-If- you have a application using a RNG then, unless you're willing to
break out of the NOT-AND-OR straight jacket then you're stuck with a PRNG.
You want a RNG but can't have one...

Granted, test vectors are a good tool but that's more a means to an end
rahter than an end. At least in my mind.
What is the expectation in your example (for example) once the system goes
into use? Does the need for repeatability still apply? I'd guess not. So
we're right back to where we started.
Would you rather run your Monte Carlo with a PRNG or a RNG? I'd say it
depends on a fuzzy concept called 'precision'. How close do you need to
be? The closer you get the more it costs, it's usually not linear either.
There's always a cost-benefit-effort tradeoff. Of this I think we all

No it isn't. You -want- a RNG but you can't have one. Nobody -wants- a
PRNG, they -settle- for it. What one wants is a bit sequence which is
-random-. There are many definitions of random, but they boil down to
-unpredictable- outside of chance with respect to predicting individual
bit results as well as sequences of bits (they are not the same
statistically speaking, re probability distributions).
Ideally what one would want is a situation where each bit has a 50/50
chance of being in either state and there are -no- inter-bit dependencies.
That implies no modulo (though it doesn't prevent clustering which can
fool you if you don't test your sub-strings well enough - re Gamblers
Which raises an interesting aspect for me, what happens if you put a PRNG
into a 'Garden of Eden' state?
Satisfying an -entropy test- is -not- equivalent to -being- a RNG. It only
says that within a particular error margin you're -close enogh-.
Really? The offset into the sequence is a fixed width and the result is
alaways a single character. Where do you add a bit?
Maybe for you, I sure as hell wouldn't use it either as a key or as a
seed into a known hashing/whiting algorithm.
Let me ask you a more pointy question. Are you selecting some offset and
then taking the sequence of digits from pi, or are you selecting the
digits out of order? In either of these cases it isn't the sequence of pi
that is providing the randomness (which is apparently the claim) but
rather the selection process; which is both undescribed at this point
-and- simply moves the argument from one area to another - this -proving-

Wrong question, the -right- questions is...
What is -random-?
It means unpredictable, this means unrepeatable. If it repeats then it
-must- be predictable; that means it ain't -random-. A PRNG isn't
unpredictable, only taking such a long time that by the time the repeat
gets there you don't care. The length of that sequence is called the
modulus of the generator. -ALL- PRNG's will repeat, if they didn't they
wouldn't be -pseudo-.

@_subject: RE: Two ideas for random number generation 
Ok. The distribution of a single digit is -not- the same as pi itself...
The -only- thing in question there is the index of the digit you started
with. From there the sequence is ABSOLUTELY deterministic. It's a basic
select and compare problem at that point. pi may be irrational, but its
value is constant. So is the sequence of digits that your algorithm
generates, irrespective of the starting digit -provided- we can ever find
an overlap in the two sequences (your original and my search). There's
been some pretty nifty string manipulation algorithms in the last few
years coupled with some of the new parallel and distributed systems....
Not a very good PRNG, not even as a seed source to a hash function.
Look. Software is nothing more than instructions to -general purpose
computing HARDWARE-. The question is what does that mean when we talk
about -hardware-? The hardware that my computer runs on is binary. And it
uses some derivation of at least two of three basic functions (ie NOT,
AND, OR). If I can't write it in software which is simply commands to
specific meshes of these basic gates (assuming of course the two meshes
can be made comparable - cost v complexity) execute specific sequences of
operations on specific bits of data. Now we take out the abstraction layer
that the -general purpose- throws in there. We take that program and build
it using the -exact- same sort of logical gate meshes. What changed?
Nothing. That's the -universal- in 'Universal Turing Machine'. What is the
-primary- dependency of the UTM? That it is -binary-.
-If- you want to do a -real- RNG then it must have some -continous-
component and include some sort of feedback(forward) dependency.
The strength of hardware comes from the fact that you can do things that
aren't representable in some other languages (eg Boolean Algebra), A/D <>
D/A conversion, dependencies on manufacturing tolerances, etc.). Those
come from the -analog- characteristic of the -representation- of the logic
in hardware. It's a -hidden- variable, so to speak.

Not if you use -only- digital gates and derived functions (eg flip flop
or a shift register). If you want a -real- RNG in hardware it -must- have
an analog stage, that analog stage must be non-linear (ie sensitive to
small changes in input), and it must use feedback.
If you can do it in hardware gates then you -can- do it in software gates.
And -real- RNG's can't be done in software. Very complicated and long
modulo PRNG's can but RNG's can't.

Actually you left something out, the PRNG by definition must have a
modulus of repetition. At some point it starts the sequence over.
In general, this is -never- a desired quality and is the primary
distinction between the cost-utility of PRNG's versus RNG's.
And on another statement by somebody about hardware v software RNG's:
If you can't develop a RNG in software (ie you'd be in a state of sin),
what makes you think you can do it using -only- digital gates in hardware?
You can't.

But that changes the game in the middle of play, the sequence of digits
in pi is fixed, not random. You can't get a random number from a constant.
Otherwise it wouldn't be a constant.
You can't stop them from using their tables. Slow them down, not stop
them. You can't use that huge a seed, hardware limitations. They can match

The examples of stable free markets include lots of examples that are not
involved with humans, ants for example. Or the way pigeons divide up the
seed in a given area so that each gets apportioned to their pecking order.
Actually you can't control the market, to try kills the market.
Actually the only time a market is stable is when the participants -don't-
analyze the market as a whole, in fact may be completely ignorant of the
existance of a 'market' for that matter. The instant 'control' gets
applied the market will break down. All the examples, mathematical and
biological, that demonstrate market stability are examples where the
agents are following a simple set of rules and this doesn't include global
market state info.
The reality is that both free and control markets fall down. It isn't a
matter of people or not. It's a matter of the 3 laws of thermodynamics.
You can't satisfy all the market agents all the time. Some time, just
because, all the air in the room does rush to one corner.

It has been suggested by some that a PRNG can be created that is -not-
repeating. There is a property of -all- RNG's that is called
For a RNG to -be- a RNG it -must- be infinity-distributed. This means that
there are -no- string repititions -ever-. If this can't be guaranteed then
the algorithm can be a PRNG (there are other conditionals). A PRNG -by
definition- can -not- rule out repititions of some very_large-distribution. Hence, -all- PRNG's must assume - even in
principle- some very_large-distribution sequence.
So, the statement "My PRNG has no modulus" is incorrect even in principle.

Section 3.5 "What is a Random Sequence?"
He also has some things to say about Pi and its applicability as a seed
in this same section, and the assumptions that people make that are not
"The representation of of a positive  real number n  in the radix-b may be
regarded as a b-ary sequence; for example, pi corresponds to the 10-ary
sequence 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, ... People have
conjectured that this sequence is infinity-distributed, but nobody has yet
been able to prove it is even 1-distributed."
It's worth pointing out that the test of 'randomness' are -all'
statistical. They all have a margin of error. There is the a priori
recognition of 'window' effect.
Which gets to the reference I mentioned in one post about 'Garden of Eden'
sequences. These would be sequences that can -never- happen from -any- of
the given input states. It is a sequence of states the generator can not
make because they are outside the scope of its algorithm (there is usually
a data set independency assumed - you can be in -all- combinations of
start state). At least as far as I know this could apply to both (P)RNG's.

Found the following at
"(..) The paper, written by Nicko van Someren, CTO of nCipher Corp., a
security equipment vendor based in Cambridge, England (..) discloses
that (..) a student researcher at nCipher recently developed a new
implementation of a factoring method known as the General Number Field
Sieve, or GNFS, which could be used to factor a 512-bit key in about
three weeks using an off-the-shelf server with an Intel Corp. Itanium
processor. The calculations the student performed using the server are
the second phase of the GNFS method.
Previously, this process was thought to be feasible only on much more
powerful computers, such as Cray supercomputers."
In a recent message, Nicko van Someren confirms:
Is there any info on the method used by this student to solve
the matrix algebra?
Is any novelty claimed beyond the technique used in
 "The program we used for this was optimized for running on vector
  computers, which is what CWI used for their record (RSA-155)
  factorization (..) We started to rewrite this program so that it
  would run better on the hardware available for us (..)
  Compaq generously let us use one of their quad processor

Actually it does. It actually means that for that cash transaction you're

Where do you think those 'cash discounts' come from? They subtract the
credit handling charge! Imagine that. Works great when a cagely merchant

A credit card does one thing, it lets you borrow somebody elses money at

mac-crypto cryptography
--- begin forwarded text
Status:  U
Organisation: g10 Code GmbH
Lines: 285
User-Agent: Gnus/5.090006 (Oort Gnus v0.06) Emacs/20.7
 (i386-debian-linux-gnu)
The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is GNU's tool for secure communication
and data storage.  It is a complete and free replacement of PGP and
can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.  It
includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant with the
proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440.  This new
release has a lot of features beyond OpenPGP which will be included in
a soon to be published RFC2440 successor.
Version 1.0.7 has been released yesterday and is available at most
mirrors (see below) now.  If you can't get it from a mirror, use the
primary location:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.0.7.tar.gz  (2.3MB)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.0.7.tar.gz.sig
Due to some new translations and the work we did over the last 11
months, the diff against 1.0.6 is somewhat large:
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.0.6-1.0.7.diff.gz  (1.3MB)
MD5 checksums of the above files are:
  d8b36d4dfd213a1a1027b1877acbc897  gnupg-1.0.7.tar.gz
  99d92e0658972b42868d7564264797ad  gnupg-1.0.6-1.0.7.diff.gz
Some new things in this version:
    * Secret keys are now stored and exported in a new format which
      uses SHA-1 for integrity checks.  This format renders the
      Rosa/Klima attack useless.  Other OpenPGP implementations might
      not yet support this, so the option --simple-sk-checksum creates
      the old vulnerable format.
    * The default cipher algorithm for encryption is now CAST5,
      default hash algorithm is SHA-1.  This will give us better
      interoperability with other OpenPGP implementations.
    * Symmetric encrypted messages now use a fixed file size if
      possible.  This is a tradeoff: it breaks PGP 5, but fixes PGP 2,
      6, and 7.  Note this was only an issue with RFC-1991 style
      symmetric messages.
    * Photographic user ID support.  This uses an external program to
      view the images.
    * Enhanced keyserver support via keyserver "plugins".  GnuPG comes
      with plugins for the NAI LDAP keyserver as well as the HKP email
      keyserver.  It retains internal support for the HKP HTTP
      keyserver.
    * Nonrevocable signatures are now supported.  If a user signs a
      key nonrevocably, this signature cannot be taken back so be
      careful!
    * Multiple signature classes are usable when signing a key to
      specify how carefully the key information (fingerprint, photo
      ID, etc) was checked.
    * --pgp2 mode automatically sets all necessary options to ensure
      that the resulting message will be usable by a user of PGP 2.x.
    * --pgp6 mode automatically sets all necessary options to ensure
      that the resulting message will be usable by a user of PGP 6.x.
    * Signatures may now be given an expiration date.  When signing a
      key with an expiration date, the user is prompted whether they
      want their signature to expire at the same time.
    * Revocation keys (designated revokers) are now supported if
      present.  There is currently no way to designate new keys as
      designated revokers.
    * Permissions on the .gnupg directory and its files are checked
      for safety.
    * --expert mode enables certain silly things such as signing a
      revoked user id, expired key, or revoked key.
    * Some fixes to build cleanly under Cygwin32.
    * New tool gpgsplit to split OpenPGP data formats into packets.
    * New option --preserve-permissions.
    * Subkeys created in the future are not used for encryption or
      signing unless the new option --ignore-valid-from is used.
    * Revoked user-IDs are not listed unless signatures are listed too
      or we are in verbose mode.
    * There is no default comment string with ascii armors anymore
      except for revocation certificates and --enarmor mode.
    * The command "primary" in the edit menu can be used to change the
      primary UID, "setpref" and "updpref" can be used to change the
      preferences.
    * Fixed the preference handling; since 1.0.5 they were erroneously
      matched against against the latest user ID and not the given one.
    * RSA key generation.
    * Merged Stefan's patches for RISC OS in.  See comments in
      scripts/build-riscos.
    * It is now possible to sign and conventional encrypt a message (-cs).
    * The MDC feature flag is supported and can be set by using
      the "updpref" edit command.
    * The status messages GOODSIG and BADSIG are now returning the primary
      UID, encoded using %XX escaping (but with spaces left as spaces,
      so that it should not break too much)
    * Support for GDBM based keyrings has been removed.
    * The entire keyring management has been revamped.
    * The way signature stati are store has changed so that v3
      signatures can be supported. To increase the speed of many
      operations for existing keyrings you can use the new
      --rebuild-keydb-caches command.
    * The entire key validation process (trustdb) has been revamped.
      See the man page entries for --update-trustdb, --check-trustdb
      and --no-auto-check-trustdb.
    * --trusted-keys is again obsolete, --edit can be used to set the
      ownertrust of any key to ultimately trusted.
    * A subkey is never used to sign keys.
    * Read only keyrings are now handled as expected.
Please read the man page entries for the options --update-trustdb and
--check-trustdb.  To get the best performance out of larger keyrings,
it is suggested that you run the new command "gpg --rebuild-keydb-caches"
once.  We tried to make the migration to 1.0.7 as smooth as possible,
but it might be good idea to backup your keyrings and the trustdb (gpg
--export-ownertrust) first.
Please note that due to a bug in prior versions, it won't be possible
to downgrade to 1.0.6 unless you use the GnuPG version which comes
with Debian's Woody release or you apply the patch
 .
Most new features and a lot of bug fixes are due to David Shaw; he
greatly helped to improve GnuPG and put a lot of work into solving a
lot of little interoperability problems with PGP.  Many thanks to him
and to all the other folks who helped with this release.

mailing lists.  If you have any question you should direct them to
mailing list gnupg-users .

They need to be taking their funds, and instead of spending it on law
suites and a business/IP model that is dead, dead, dead; and invest it in
technology companies that show great promise in bringing the 'grid'
computing paradigm to fruition sooner (rather than later).
Once that technology comes into play, people will buy anything digitizale
directly from the source. No distribution channels, no loans, no nothing.
Just 1:1 (with the individual parties banks acting as auditors of the

Government and Economics are -technologies-, technologies that stem from
the specialization (and hence compartmentalization) required to get to a
point where technology is advanced enough (and ubiquitous enough) so that
each person can take care of themselves all by themselves.

Codes & Ciphers: Julius Ceasar, the Enigma, and the Internet
R. Churchhouse
ISBN ISBN 0-521-00890-5
This looks to be a great book for intermediate readers (or beginners who
have the math). It's nowhere near the completeness or complexity of
Applied Cryptography, but then for $20 who would expect it to. It consists
of chapters that cover particular sorts of crypto/code methods (eg Ch. 2
"Fom Julius Ceasar to simple substitution") with the basic(!) math
included in an appendix per each chapter.
If you haven't got the cash for Applied Cryptography and you're curious,
this may be the book for you. Oh yeah, has problems for each chapter w/
answers in the back.
ps This book is published by Cambridge, they seem to be publishing a spike
   of good books on math, crypto, and other technical subjects at the
   current time. You may also want to visit their list of currently
   available items (sorry, no URL handy - Google is your friend ;).

Global Village Idiocy
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN
JAKARTA, Indonesia  During a dinner with Indonesian
journalists in Jakarta, I was taken aback when Dini
Djalal, a reporter for The Far Eastern Economic
Review, suddenly launched into a blistering criticism
of the Fox News Channel and Bill O'Reilly. "They say
[on Fox], `We report, you decide,' but it's biased 
they decide before us," she said. "They say there is
no spin, but I get dizzy looking at it. I also get
upset when they invite on Muslims and just insult
Why didn't she just not watch Fox when she came to
America, I wondered? No, no, no, explained Ms. Djalal:
The Fox Channel is now part of her Jakarta cable
package. The conservative Bill O'Reilly is in her face
every night.
On my way to Jakarta I stopped in Dubai, where I
watched the Arab News Network at 2 a.m. ANN broadcasts
from Europe, outside the control of any Arab
government, but is seen all over the Middle East. It
was running what I'd call the "greatest hits" from the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict: nonstop film of Israelis
hitting, beating, dragging, clubbing and shooting
Palestinians. I would like to say the footage was out
of context, but there was no context. There were no
words. It was just pictures and martial music designed
to inflame passions.
An Indonesian working for the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta,
who had just visited the Islamic fundamentalist
stronghold of Jogjakarta, told me this story: "For the
first time I saw signs on the streets there saying
things like, `The only solution to the Arab-Israel
conflict is jihad  if you are true Muslim, register
yourself to be a volunteer.' I heard people saying,
`We have to do something, otherwise the Christians or
Jewish will kill us.' When we talked to people to find
out where [they got these ideas], they said from the
Internet. They took for granted that anything they
learned from the Internet is true. They believed in a
Jewish conspiracy and that 4,000 Jews were warned not
to come to work at the World Trade Center [on Sept.
11]. It was on the Internet."
What's frightening him, he added, is that there is an
insidious digital divide in Jogjakarta: "Internet
users are only 5 percent of the population  but these
5 percent spread rumors to everyone else. They say,
`He got it from the Internet.' They think it's the
If there's one thing I learned from this trip to
Israel, Jordan, Dubai and Indonesia, it's this: thanks
to the Internet and satellite TV, the world is being
wired together technologically, but not socially,
politically or culturally. We are now seeing and
hearing one another faster and better, but with no
corresponding improvement in our ability to learn
from, or understand, one another. So integration, at
this stage, is producing more anger than anything
else. As the writer George Packer recently noted in
The Times Magazine, "In some ways, global satellite TV
and Internet access have actually made the world a
less understanding, less tolerant place."
At its best, the Internet can educate more people
faster than any media tool we've ever had. At its
worst, it can make people dumber faster than any media
tool we've ever had. The lie that 4,000 Jews were
warned not to go into the World Trade Center on Sept.
11 was spread entirely over the Internet and is now
thoroughly believed in the Muslim world. Because the
Internet has an aura of "technology" surrounding it,
the uneducated believe information from it even more.
They don't realize that the Internet, at its ugliest,
is just an open sewer: an electronic conduit for
untreated, unfiltered information.
Worse, just when you might have thought you were all
alone with your extreme views, the Internet puts you
together with a community of people from around the
world who hate all the things and people you do. And
you can scrap the BBC and just get your news from
those Web sites that reinforce your own stereotypes.
A couple of years ago, two Filipino college graduates
spread the "I Love You" virus over the Internet,
causing billion of dollars in damage to computers and
software. But at least that virus was curable with the
right software. There is another virus going around
today, though, that's much more serious. I call it the
"I Hate You" virus. It's spread on the Internet and by
satellite TV. It infects people's minds with the most
vile ideas, and it can't be combated by just
downloading a software program. It can be reversed
only with education, exchanges, diplomacy and human
interaction  stuff you have to upload the
old-fashioned way, one on one. Let's hope it's not too
late. "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." Anais Nin  "You can safely assume that you've created God in your own image, when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do." Anne Lamott

Reply-To: psychohistory
The Kidnap of Mass Mind - Fundamentalism, Spartanism
and the Games Subcultures Play   Here are the implications of a neural net simulation
carried out at Tokai University in Kanagawa, Japan. If
citizens combine civility's self-restraint with social
freedom, the neural net in which they're twined spills
forth solutions of the finest kind - those which
produce a host of winning strategies. If citizens rage
out of control when left alone but are held in check
by a police state, the neural net goes blank. All
power seeps into the hands of a central authority.
This maximum leader, implies the research, can be a
previous fringe figure and an utter incompetent.
What's worse, complexity pioneer Stuart Kauffman has
shown with yet another mathematical model how a
"Stalinist" chief and his morality enforcers can give
the collective brainwork a lobotomy.
The Kanagawa simulation implies that Fundamentalist
strategies of beating up on others for their sins
rather than controlling one's self drags us all toward
authoritarian ferocity. The trick is to reassert the
right to self-restraint and to the definition of one's
own boundaries of behavior and privacy, boundaries
which include that consideration toward those who
disagree with us which we call civility. If we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the future.

Let's solve against the young navels, but don't scold the weak books. The long pen rarely judges Ramez, it improves Valerie instead. All sick enigmas are open and other lost grocers are difficult, but will Yvette pour that? Just grasping within a pitcher for the street is too cheap for Bill to behave it. They are lifting above lean, towards upper, beneath sticky frames. We cover the fat twig. Tomorrow, Ghassan never promises until Allan irritates the handsome teacher furiously. Otto calls, then Thomas frantically orders a sweet smog before Saad's lane. What does Ziad dine so hatefully, whenever Rudy irrigates the poor poultice very strongly? Are you deep, I mean, moving beneath strong ointments? Julie's card sows around our ticket after we kill beneath it. She wants to excuse easy tyrants over Brian's sunshine. It should change brave painters behind the weird polite mountain, whilst Johann badly lives them too. One more tapes will be quiet noisy puddles. Fucking don't join wastefully while you're jumping beneath a dry ulcer. I was pulling coconuts to lazy Zakariya, who's nibbling against the paper's star. For Ismat the carpenter's smart, outside me it's proud, whereas towards you it's walking clever. The shirts, buttons, and bushs are all worthwhile and blank.

                     Weather permitting we meet in the un-covered tables.
                     If it's inclimate but not overly cold we meet in the                      outside covered section. Otherwise look for us inside

Reply-To: 9fans
Submit your paper for the 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and
Implementation (OSDI '02).  OSDI '02 takes a broad view of what the
systems area encompasses and solicits contributions from all fields of
systems practice including, but not limited to: operating systems,
networking, storage, distributed systems, parallel systems, mobile
systems, embedded systems, the influence of hardware development on
systems and vice-versa. We particularly encourage contributions
containing highly original ideas or ground-breaking results that push
the systems frontier.
Paper submissions are due on May 17, 2002.
This is a hard deadline -- no extensions will be given.
Submission guidelines are available on the USENIX Web site:
OSDI '02 will bring together professionals from academic and industrial
backgrounds for 2.5 days of single-track technical sessions with
refereed papers presentations and a keynote address. A session of
Work-in-Progress presentations is also planned, in addition to informal
Birds-of-a-Feather sessions organized by attendees.
We look forward to receiving your submissions.

What the hell does *live* mean? There are quite a few folks on this planet
who 'sell' nothing. They grow their own food, they build their own house.
They do favors for their neighbors in return for favors. It's not even
commerce in the barter sense of the word.
I've got a friend who just came back from Africa (she got Cerebral
Malaria and they cut short her tour) and from what she says 'money' is
pretty useless there. No stores, no electricity, no telephones, no air
conditioning. No medical (it was a three hour drive by Jeep to get her to
a airstrip where they could get her to a hotel - all paid with US tax
dollars - not one African whatever they use).
Everybody on the planet doesn't live in Ctl. LA.
And Americans wonder why the rest of the world would like to flush most of
us down the toilet....self-absorbed hubris.

Again, bull. Jeesh, you should go into the manure business. You'd be rich
in no time.
These poeple do -not- use modular arithmetic. The machines and the
software they run does. They put a card in (maybe) and enter a number or
two and then wallah, it happens like (Clarkian) magic.
Further, if they believe these systems are foolproof then they're
mistaken. They are -hard- to crack, not impossible.

Don't know about Elloi's comment but your responce is clearly cow manure.
Which is a specious extension. These work by being the -exception- to the
rules, as you so rightly point out. Their mechanisms would -not- work if
they were the status quo. There would be no need. They exist because of
the profit inherent in black markets (something supporters of the war on
drugs should wake up and figure out - they're the ones who are providing
fodder for terrorism and such).

Bullshit, they charge interest on the loans and such. You should read your
credit card bills closer. Every time you use a credit card there is a
interest charge for the 'loan' applied. If you don't pay on time they kick
the interest rate up to completely outrageous levels (which is what has
driven the consumer conflict with the CC companies lo these many years).
??? I guess the vendor who pays the fees to use credit cards just pulls
the money out of thin air...not hardly.

Most such purchases are not 'off the cuff'. They are planned.
Bullshit, most folks plan their future purchases, especially if it isn't
something like rent or food. Things like new TV's are -not- 'random'
purchases (whatever the hell that might mean).
Bull. Most folks will get by with about $50/day for about 350-360
(birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, vacation, etc.) days of the year.
No it doesn't. A credit card in and of itself gives you access to somebody
elses money. You have to pay them back with your own (preferably w/o a
credit card - funny that, no?).
Right, Certified Checks have been around for quite a while.
Well you've got the right idea, though it needs work. It also demonstrates
the problems with Hettinga's 'digital bearer bonds'. What -will- replace credit cards and checks and other stuff is a better
network and a protocol that will allow one person to -directly- transfer
funds from their bank to the buyers bank -with- a proviso for rollback
within a particular period. A form of escrow. What -will- make the system
stable, trustworthy, and ubiquitous is the fact that there -are- parties
other than buyer and seller involved (the major flaw with Hettinga's
theory) to wnsure fair dispute resolution.

Paranoia and trust I'd imagine.
Exactly, you're the one confusing 'use' with 'being able to reproduce'.
Why do these folks use money? Because it's universal and culturaly
acceptable. Actually not,
By convincing some group of others in addition to Joe, Gord, and Jeff they
will recieve a benefit for such use. It must 'profit' them.
No, it requires a general change in perspective of the market. Almost
everyone must agree that it's useful, though unproven. And then let folks
try to prove its utility.

It makes no sense to talk about 'cheapness of payment' from the recipients
view. It costs them nothing to get paid (outside of whatever service or
labor was involved in the exchange). You have your cognates reversed
(ie payer v payee).
Credit cards are a convenience to the person who is doing the paying.
They're just another expense to the business side.

It can be, depends on the business.
You don't need to carry it around, except for change and the immediate
income (which you drop box several times a day). Not a problem of the
scale you describe.
Actually $3k (assuming a 50% split with the tax man) and you're only
trying to cover your butt.
This actually segues into the distinction between 'capitalism' and
'commerce'. In capitalism the 'merchant', let's call him Barbarossa is
trying to not only cover his immediate needs, as well as reasonable
investment, but trying to actually maximize that income at the expense of
other players in the market.

Who is Andy going to 'prove' it to then, other than Betty? And Betty
already knows (assuming no accident or such). Nobody that's who, because
Andy doesn't want 3rd parties involved. 'Proof' is -only- useful if there
is a 3rd party involved who has some authority or 'actionable ability' to

Pointless exercise that.

No, that is -not- where the cost of the bricks, mortar, and such come
from. Where they -do- come from is the alternation of each agent in a
market from buyer to seller. It is this dynamic and the potential for
profit (which long term causes inflation) that drives economics.
Each transaction -must- stand on its own two feet, otherwise the concept
of 'market' and 'voluntary exchnage' go by the wayside.

June 24-26, 2002.  This
Public Announcement will expire on June 30, 2002.
The World Bank's Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics - Europe
(ABCDE-Europe) is scheduled to take place in Oslo, Norway from June 24-26,
2002.  Tight security will be in place in and around the venue for the
conference (Holmenkollen area of Oslo).  Previous summits in other capitals
have drawn "anti-globalization" and other activists from around the world,
and U.S. citizens should bear in mind that anti-globalization demonstrations
in other European cities have sometimes turned violent.
Demonstrations and protest marches are expected in downtown Oslo from June
22 through June 26.  Travelers are advised to follow news and traffic
reports, avoid crowds and demonstrations and to exercise caution.  Travelers
should be aware of heightened security and potential delays in entering
Norway during this period and should always carry proof of identity and
Police intend to temporarily close access to some downtown train stations in
connection with approved demonstrations and will forbid parking in the city
center throughout the summit period.  In addition, public transportation
schedules may be altered.  These temporary actions will be posted through
the local media.
The U.S. Embassy is located at Drammensveien 18, Oslo.  The Embassy may be
contacted 24 hours a day at telephone (47) 2244-8550 in connection with
emergencies such as arrest, serious injury or death of a U.S. citizen.  The
American Citizen Services Unit is open for routine, non-emergency matters
from 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon, Monday through Friday.
For more information on travel to Norway, please consult the latest

Reply-To: 9fans
I was intrigued by the prospect of running a
TLS-tunneled VNC over the internet (since right
now I run plaintext VNCs over the internet),
so I looked up stunnel.  The interface seemed
more reasonable than what I posted earlier today,
so I built an equivalent one for Plan 9.
Sources now has the following new (and documented) programs:
I figured out how to generate new certificates with
OpenSSL and documented that too.
     TLSSRV(8)                                               TLSSRV(8)
     NAME
          tlssrv, tlsclient, tlssrvtunnel, tlsclienttunnel - TLS
          server and client
     SYNOPSIS
          tlssrv [ -c cert.pem ] [ -l logfile ] [ -r remotesys ] cmd [
          args ... ]
          tlsclient [ -t trustedkeys ] [ -x excludedkeys ] address
          tlssrvtunnel plain-addr crypt-addr cert.pem
          tlsclienttunnel crypt-addr plain-addr trustedkeys
     DESCRIPTION
          Tlssrv is a helper program, typically exec'd in a
          /bin/service file to establish an SSL or TLS connection
          before launching cmd args; a typical command might start the
          IMAP or HTTP server.  Cert.pem is the server certificate;
          factotum(4) should hold the corresponding private key.  The
          specified logfile is by convention the same as for the tar-
          get server.  Remotesys is mainly used for logging.
          Tlsclient is the reverse of tlssrv: it dials address, starts
          TLS, and then relays between the network connection and
          standard input and output.  If the -t flag (and, optionally,
          the -x flag) is given, the remote server must present a key
          whose SHA1 hash is listed in the file trustedkeys but not in
          the file excludedkeys. See thumbprint(6) for more informa-
          tion.
          Tlssrvtunnel and tlsclienttunnel use these tools and listen1
          (see listen(8)) to provide TLS network tunnels, allowing
          legacy application to take advantage of TLS encryption.
     EXAMPLES
          Listen for TLS-encrypted IMAP by creating a server certifi-
          cate /sys/lib/tls/imap.pem and a listener script
          /bin/service.auth/tcp993 containing:
                              exec tlssrv -c/sys/lib/tls/imap.pem -limap4d -r`{cat $3/remote} \
                   /bin/ip/imap4d -p -dyourdomain -r`{cat $3/remote} \
                   >[2]/sys/log/imap4d
          Interact with the server, putting the appropriate hash into
          /sys/lib/tls/mail and running:
               tlsclient -t /sys/lib/tls/mail tcp!server!imaps
          Create a TLS-encrypted VNC connection from a client on
          kremvax to a server on moscvax:
               mosc% vncs -d :3
               mosc% tlssrvtunnel tcp!moscvax!5903 tcp!*!12345 \
                       /usr/you/lib/cert.pem
               krem% tlsclienttunnel tcp!moscvax!12345 tcp!*!5905 \
                       /usr/you/lib/cert.thumb
               krem% vncv kremvax:5
          (The port numbers passed to the VNC tools are offset by 5900
          from the actual TCP port numbers.)
     FILES
          /sys/lib/tls
     SOURCE
          /sys/src/cmd/tlssrv.c
          /sys/src/cmd/tlsclient.c

          /rc/bin/tlsclienttunnel

     BUGS
          There is not yet a Plan 9 tool to generate X.509 certifi-
          cates and public keys.  Instead, use the Unix openssl
          toolkit:
               openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

As an operator of one of the nodes, versus somebody who is just a
subscriber, I'll be happy to state that while clearly a waste of anybody
with a clues time the submissions are not distruptive to the list. Nor or
they spam. They are within the charter of cryptography (and related

filter him out is specious; we don't want to filter anyone (do you

To attack somebody through their ISP via false claims of abuse for no
reason other than they piss you off is the epitome of chicken shit
behaviour. It's also another excellent example of what hypocrites the
majority of CACL mouthpieces are.

Yes, a major problem.
Why are you to decide what is or is not relevant to the other list
members? Why is it that instead of managing your own mailbox, and in the
process promoting general peace (which you seem to be promoting by
homogenizing the discussion in this forum), instead you feel it is better
than your belief of what is or isn't relevant should be applied to all of
us? It is clear you are not willing to allow us to reciprocate and decide
what goes in your mailbox?
So much for CACL individualism...
The CACL Cypherpunk Contengent (CACL-CC ?) are a funny bunch. They promote
freedom of speech and action based around individual choice. Yet when put
in a position of conflict they use the same old 'force it all into one
mold' strategies that they (supposedly) rail against. Why is it this
contengent is the first to call for banning and filtering en masse?
How odd.

Well their political leaders do anyway. Not sure if it's consistent to
equate the American people with their leaders.
There is usually no single objective. Further, if your goal is anything
other than peaceful co-existance any distinction between you and the enemy
is specious.
Specious distinction. The agent pursuing the 'antagonistic interest' is a

Yeah, it's called politics.

This country is going through a crisis of civil liberties and a fundamental
loss of faith in the tenets of democracy. It is becoming more fascist (ie
public management of private property) on a daily basis. In the near future
it could become completely socialist (ie public management of public
property and elimination of private property) in the name of the greater
good. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or
the individual is in direct conflict with both the spirit and words of the
Constitution. Legislative, judicial, and executive branch decisions and
actions speak to this on a daily basis. One of the most controversial topics
is the private ownership of weapons and the duty of the government to
regulate the same. The current discussion on both sides is limited solely to
the 2nd Amendment. Unfortunately this is a stillborn position because it
misses fundamental issues and questions. To address those I have listed each
of the relevant sections of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Perusal
of these make it clear that the right of the individual to own and bear arms
with no interference or regulation is a fundamental right of every American.
This right is justified by a long history of abuse by political systems of

It is worth making special note that the Presidential claim to executive

into action unless it can not be convened. The President of the United
States is not in the chain of command of the military forces without
specific authorization from Congress. Until such time as that is given only
Congress has the authority to direct and organize military activities. This
means that the President may direct military forces only until Congress
convenes. At that point Congress must decide whether to agree to commit the
Amendment 2, 4, & 9 provide in and of themselves sufficient grounds to find
any federal involvement in the purchase, possession, or operation of a
weapon to be unconstitutional. One of the most specious argumenst in this
discussion is that 'the people' in the 2nd Amendment is not to be construed
as meaning the individual. However, it is clear from the Constitution itself
and other amendments, such as the 4th, that this simply is not so. The term
'the people' means that the decision regarding such issues is to be made at
the level of the individual. In other words whether a particular individual
agrees to participate is completely voluntary.
                   THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
   We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
   union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the
   common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings
   of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish
   this Constitution for the United States of America.
[ Note that the intent of the Constitution, and by extension those who
  represent us, is to provide freedom of choice (i.e. liberty) for each
  individual (i.e. 'ourselves and our posterity'). This means that any
  claim that 'the people' does not refer to the individual and their
  right to make individual choices is specious and misdirected. See
  the DoI, in particular the first two paragraphs for an expansion of the
  'American' view of 'The People'. No, it's not law; It's better, it's
  first principle. It's the 'Authority' that 'The Law' rests own. The
  very bedrock of American society; We The People. ]
  Article I
   Section 8. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,
   duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the
   common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all
   duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United
   States;
   To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules
   concerning captures on land and water;
   To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use
   shall be for a longer term than two years;
   To provide and maintain a navy;
   To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval
   forces;
   To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the
   union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;
[ Note it says 'the militia', not plural and definitely not state oriented
  since states are prohibited from raising or supporting troops. Note that
  it specificaly directs Congress and the President to use the Militia for
  internal issues only. The Army is for external issues only. No If, No
  And, No But. No 'National Interest', No Exceptions. ]
   To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and
   for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of
   the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the
   appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia
   according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;
[ This says Congress organizes, armes, and disciplines the militia - again
  nothing to do with the states and no implication of plurality. The only
  job the states have is appointing officers. One can argue over the wording
  of the training since it is ambigous. I interpet "..., reserving to the
  states repesctively, the appointment of the officers, .." as being a
  single clause and not carrying over to "... authority of training ...". ]
   No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of
   tonnage, keep troops, or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any
   agreement or compact with another state, or with a foreign power, or
   engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as
   will not admit of delay.
[ This last paragraph is of special importance. It directs the states to
  provide for their self defence during times of truly imminent danger.
  There is also the implication of immediate responce. Yet the state can
  not keep troops or even collect taxes to this end. This also excludes the
  Militia since it is under federal control and can't be used by the states
  without federal consent. In other words they are not to base their responce
  solely on state or federal employees. The  implication is that each state is
  directed to provide for individual firearms ownership, on a voluntary
  basis.
  It's also worth noting that if the US is actualy invaded and the federal
  forces are activated the states are still directed to raise forces
  independently of the federal forces, and these forces would be under
  state control and operated in parallel with federal forces. In addition
  this delegates the states to independant resistance even if the federal
  authorities surrender. It is a fundamental recognition of the states
  independence. [1] ]
  Article II
   Section 2. The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and
   Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states,
   when called into the actual service of the United States; he may
   require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of
   the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of
   their respective offices, and he shall have power to grant reprieves
   and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of
   impeachment.
[ This last paragraph describes how the President takes control of the
  military. It is only after Congress agrees to release the authority.
  Normal day to day training and patrol duties are responsible to Congress
  only. ]
  Article IV
   Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every state in this
   union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them
   against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the
   executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic
   violence.
[ Note this says that federal forces can not be employeed within a state
  without the explicit permission of the state government during periods of
  domestic violence. In other words "rioting in the streets" is not a
  sufficient condition for forced federal involvement through martial law.
  The state legislature is the prefered authority unless it can't be convened
  in time. In that case the state governor can make the decision but as soon as
  the state legislature is convened he's out of the picture. This means that
  states always have the option of refusing federal assisstance. This means the
  various forced tax and funds refusal threats of the federal government are
  unconstitutional. This means states have the option of opting out of any
  federal gun control regulations. As an extension, this guarantees States
  the right to leave the Union. ]
                             THE BILL OF RIGHTS
   The Conventions of a number of the States having, at the time of
   adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent
   misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and
   restrictive clauses should be added, and as extending the ground of
   public confidence in the Government will best insure the beneficent
   ends of its institution;
[ Hmmmm, now what do you think they mean by that?...Government is 'Good'?
  I think not. ]
   Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
   States of America, in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses
   concurring, that the following articles be proposed to the
   Legislatures of the several States, as amendments to the Constitution
   of the United States; all or any of which articles, when ratified by
   three-fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and
   purposes as part of the said Constitution, namely:
  Amendment II
   A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
   state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
   infringed.
[ This one really speaks for itself once you've understood the rest. They
  are actualy speaking of *two* seperate entities - the single federal
  Militia *and* the individual citizen. They are *not* one and the same. ]
  Amendment III
   No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without
   the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be
   prescribed by law.
  Amendment IV
   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
   and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
   violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
   supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
   place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
[ Our current society has a problem with what is understood to be
  'reasonable'. This is a strong indication that we need to create a new
  amendment to better describe the interface, expectations, and limits
  of actions regarding state representatives and the individual. The only
  other option is to eliminate laws respecting consensual crimes such as
  individual drug use, abortion, etc.
  Arguments based on 'community standard' are inherently broken. It implies
  the community has some homogenious standard, there is certainly no
  indication of authority to sample the populate with respect to this
  question. The religious and free speech and press clauses
  prohibit it. It further prohibits laws and acts respecting law
  enforcement based on statistical averages, profiles, mass searches,
  bumper stickers, public statements not inciting something worse than
  domestic violence, etc. Note that this *does* give Congress the option of
  training the militia for operations involving nuclear, biological, or
  chemical attack for domestic use. (I believe that any such use must
  not allow weapons for other than personal defence to these federal
  forces. No tanks, bombs, missiles, etc.)
  You can't use an individuals beliefs as a basis for law. In that case, with
  no sample, the only question is would any citizen object to the
  behaviour? It is obvious the question must be answered in the negative
  since you have such an example at hand from the community. This effectively
  eliminates consensual crimes. If an activity does not cause physical harm
  to a person, their property, or a voluntary public trust it can't be made
  against the law at the federal level. (I don't believe a coersive public
  trust can exist under our Constitution. You can't punish a state or throw
  a citizen in jail because they object to participate in federal programs.
  Any federal programs.) ]
  Amendment IX
   The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
   construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[ This one is really short and sweet. If anybody has a right then everybody
  has the right. There are no womens rights, gay rights, or minority rights;
  only human rights.
  This amendment prevents the government from even addressing what a persons
  rights are by the simple expedient that it prevents the federal or state
  government from even enumerating what they aren't. In other words unless
  the authority over some activity is proscribed in the Constitution the
  question of jurisdiction and decision are the individual states.
  It also means that the Supreme Court is prevented from using rulings that
  are of the enumerable type. In other words, simply because there isn't a
  directive in the Constitution is not sufficient reason to deny the
  individual the right of expression, or choice of execution. So arguments
  such as 'assissted suicide" isn't a right because there is no indication in
  the Constitution are specious and deny recognized fundamental individual
  rights in the 1st Amendment. So, in the case of gun control if there is a
  question at the federal level of jurisdiction (ie "What is meant by 'the
  people'?) the decision goes to the states and their individual constitutions.
  If it's not covererd in their individual constitutions then individuals in
  those states may make the decision on an individual basis. The Constitution
  is designed to fail-safe under questions of federal authority to the states
  or the individual. If Congress can't provide a delegate entry in the
  Constitution per the 10 th. it must suggest a constitutional amendment to
  the states. The current question of gun control has only two outcomes. Either
  individuals have their right to own guns recognized or the Congress and the
  state legislatures are required to mold an amendment to clarify the 2nd
  Amendment. The states can always stop federal aquisition of new
  authority at this point by simply refusing to put the amendment up for vote.
  At this point the states have a tacit admission of their supreme authority
  in such questions. ]
  Amendment X
   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
   prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states
   respectively, or to the people.
[ This amendment severely limits what the federal level of authority covers.
  It requires the Congress to provide a delegate, one or more sentences,
  in the Constition for all laws (and I believe for all suggested bills as
  well). it further specifies that in questions of dispute the decision goes
  to the individual states and their republican governments (ie state
  constitution). If the indvidual states don't regulate the activity it is up
  to the individual to participate voluntarily.
  The United States of America is a balkanized collection if independant
  states who voluntarily give up limited authority to the federal level, they
  must explicitly agree to this to become a state. ]
The above document was submitted to the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer, it
has been expanded since that time. As a result I received various replies.
My comments on the replies are included below along with quotes from the
replies to clarify context.
There was no intent not to keep the army going full-time. The intent was to
keep them from getting funding for long periods of time. In other words to
make it harder for them to build a long-term command structure and weapons
cache's (ie hide trusted soldiers away for rainy days). The army is intended
for repelling invasions and insurrections, how often do those happen and how
many last more than two years? If an actual invasion were to take place
martial law would be invoked and the budget limits would be irrelevant at that
But your point is true enough, and I was hoping somebody would bring this
aspect up. It has some interesting points that don't seem to have been
discussed. If you or others know of references I'd appreciate a vector.
If we accept this view (which I have no problem with, it'd be hard for a
Navy to invade Kansas - navies are self limiting) we are left with
joint-contracts that involve the army and navy are unconstitutional. The other
side would be that the navy must accept the more strict contractual limitations
imposed on the army by the Constitution (what I actualy prefer because of
new weapons systems). The intent is to keep the army on a short leash and to be
able to simply bypass this by working with other arms of the military would be
contrary to the Constitutions intent. One could transfer all the army soldiers
to navy command and impliment an oppressive regime that way. I don't believe
that was what was intended.
It also raises the fact that since the Army Air Corp was turned into the Air
Force (and this applies to the Navy and Marine Corp. as well) and no specific
guidance was made via constitutional amendment as to its budget constraints
it may be unconstitutional as currently implimented. Per the 10th there is
nothing that gives Congress the authority to create new military forces
outside of the army and navy. This should be done via a constitutional
What we have today is a joint command that integrates all the various
military forces under one umbrella. That joint command is an arm of the
executive branch and not Congress, that may be unconstitutional itself. This
raises the question of how seperate they are now and how congruent with the
Constitution it actualy is.
So, because of this the Joint Chiefs and the Pentagon may be unconstitutional
as currently implimented, or one could argue that all budgets must be limited
to 2 years. Since the Constitution requires such budgets to be reviewed from
time to time it implies that a full budget review of the military is required
every two years.
If you're a citizen of the US not only is it your place it's your duty.
To quote Jefferson:
The earth belonds to the living, not the dead.
The founding fathers wanted Americans to be free peoples pursuing their own
individual life, liberty, and happiness. It is the duty of all Americans to
protect those rights, even from other Americans. We have to decide the way
*we* want to live and the kind of world our children will inheret. The kind
of world our forefathers had and the decisions they made within that milieu
are good for exemplary review only. Santyana is a good guide. If nothing
else it is clear the fight is never over. No matter what we do our children
will have to fight it all over again on different ground and different
issues. We should at least give them a fighting chance.
I don't believe for a moment the founding fathers felt they had created a
once-and-for-all document. Nor do I believe they felt they were living at
the epitome of technical and social achievement within the total history of
mankind. Part of Jeffersons stock and trade was advancement, it's why he
created the University of Virginia. They knew they couldn't predict the future
and the best peoples to judge it were the ones living it. What they wanted
was a mechanism that would guarantee that the poeple had a say and were not
ruled over by a despot or tyranny. They hoped to give us a good chance at
reaching our individual and social goals, what those goals were are for us to
decide. We, not the founding fathers, have to live with them after all. They
were, if nothing else, simply trying to be good parents (both to a country
and to their biological children) and teach us basic principles.
I don't believe in the draft, it is coersion and is contrary to the tenets
of the Constitution. An army made of people who don't *want* to fight for
their country will lose. An army of peoples who will die rather than
surrender their liberty will always win, even if they are all killed they
deny the oppressor their goals.
One does not give up democracy to protect democracy.
This does point up one aspect of nuclear defence that has also seldome been
discussed, nuclear suicide. Instead of pointing weapons at other countries
one points the weapons (lot's of them) at oneself. If another country begins
a nuclear conflict (which is inherently unwinnable) the Earth as we know it
will become uninhabitable. Who wants to subject their peoples to the starvation
and other privations that will bring on. It is better to kill oneself
quickly and humanely and in that act poison the well so the enemy suffers at
their own hands and in the worst way. I believe we will never get rid of
nuclear weapons, and shouldn't, and this is the only sane way to control their
Actualy it's not the same thing at all. As to federalization of state
militia's. This should surprise no-one since states can't keep troops of any
form, even militia. The Constitution is also clear that there can be only
*one* militia and it is a national or federal militia. Even Mr. Denning
doesn't seem to catch the paradox because of his use of 'militias' in the
plural. It also misses the point that individual rights to own weapons is
*not* based on the requirement to have a militia. If the Constitution is
taken as a whole the right of the individual to own and bear arms is in
addition to both the federal military and militia. Also, his claim that
membership in the Militia is universal is faulty as well, membership is
voluntary but by no means mandatory as he implies.
There are a couple of issues with the current implimentation of the National
Guard as well. If it's the militia then there can't be 50 of them organized
by state. If they're not the militia then the state funding that goes
directly into them is unconstitutional. The reality is that at the federal
level there are three military forces; army, navy, and militia.
I am unaware of any assaults on federal gun control laws that use this line
of reasoning; states are required to protect themselves against invasion or
periods of domestic violence not dependant upon federal or even state
resources and that this authorizes private ownership of weapons. If you can
point to a summary of such a case I'd appreciate it.
I see the point he's making, I think it makes some assumptions that aren't
realy valid though.
At the federal level you have: army, navy, militia. All are managed by
Congress unless they hand authority to the President. In all cases the
funding and regulation comes from Congress. The states do get to appoint the
officers of the Militia however. I assume this is under the presumption that
such officers are more likely to refuse to follow federal orders if those
orders are clearly outside the line. It's a sort of checks and balances.
Now if we look at the section on states, that I claim gives the states the
responsibility to keep an indipendant force in time of invasion, there is no
stipulation as to who or how they are to be selected, organized, or funded;
other than it ain't federal or state doing it. One could argue that this
would then mean counties/parishes and then indipendant municipalities
before it gets to individual citizens, but that seems to beg the question in
my mind; not to mention they are not involved in the government of the US. It
can't be federal because there is no delegate that directs the Congress to
allocate funds for this use. It can't be the states doing the funding since
they are specificaly prohibited from doing this, without permission from
Congress, until an actual invasion or a situation that 'will not admit delay'.
This implies the sherrif and associated folks going from house to house asking
for help from the citizens as they see fit. Bubba and all his rowdies (those
that haven't been co-opted by the federal forces so far) along with Grandpa
and the two Jones' sisters ( :) ) getting in their pick-ups and going hunting.
It seems to me that it is the lower civil authorities deputizing the commen
citizen as a last ditch defence effort.
I think 'deputized citizen' is a more accurate term to describe the
participants of this last ditch effort to retain freedom.
As to the claim of militia or citizen soldiers not being effective, there
are plenty of bush wars going on right now that would argue contrary to

The list has been under 'attack' for a while. There are multiple parties
and they don't seem to be working in concert.
I base this on the observation, for example, that during the recent
group diatribe over 'filter this ...' at one point I received a mass of
removal notices from a bunch of spam lists. I'd guesstimate a couple dozen
over a two day period (or so).
Secondly, that when this happened the total amount of spam dropped
considerably (based on intentional eye count of sniffer logs). Then over
the last several weeks it has ramped back up to new levels (roughtly 2x
the past peak total to date). This is of course on the unfiltered backbone
and straight feeds like SSZ.
Thirdly, I operate several other lists and by comparing (again roughly)
the amount of bounces they get (because the spam source isn't subscribed)
plus the total that get through should (my axiom) be about equal to what
come into cypherpunks; wich is a harlet of a mailing list.
They ain't close.

Your email is YOUR EMAIL, not your ISP's.
Compare what happens with spammers and RBL style restrictions by comparing
your ISP to an apartment house and the physical network as streets.
Think hard, it should take no more than about 5 minutes for you to figure
it out.

Sorry assed socialist rat bastards. Hypocrites too since the spammers use them as a easy source of Open Relay info - otherwise they'd have to hunt
for it themselves. The cost of doing spam would be much higher.
Sue their ass your right to free association is being violated!

Yes it does, it says that any time you measure a system it WILL be in an
unknown state after the measurement. No if's, no but's. It effects photons
(which I challenge you to demonstrate has 'charge') as well as electrons
and protons. It's universal. It's about measuring, not about what is being
The 2nd also comes into play because any mechanism you use to 'manipulate'
that internal state must also effect that state in a negative way.
You're screwed two ways from Sunday.

Random photons in optical systems are easy to get at hight speed, a flame.
BEC's also have the capability to make some significant breaks in the
security of optical encryption. For example, one can trap a photon in a
BEC, measure it's parameters at one of the BEC-component atoms, then
re-emit the photon without changing its state (the trick is we are
measuring a part of the photon not the entire photon, and the photon is
standing still - frozen in time).

@_subject: Fakes... (fwd) 
There is something extremely wrong with every single
person in this world. They seem to be part of a
pointless simulation.
"The Matrix" has portrayed this idea somewhat, yet we
watch it and go back to our daily lives.  Yet in this
very life, underneath the seeming diversity in
people's opinions, values, talents, and interests,
there is something that makes everyone the same.  It
is as though this planet is populated only by mindless
fakes, objects that provide the appearance of
intellect on the surface but are based on only
mechanical reflexes and primitive thought patterns.
I don't really care if anything I say has been said
before, if it was portrayed in movies, in books, or in
the lyrics of some useless song. With 6 billion people
covering the globe at any given time, thousands and
thousands of years of written literature, probability
dictates almost any combination of words has occurred
numerous times. Yet there is clear evidence there was
no action, so those words, just like the people who
spoke them, must have been just more fakes. I am
forced to use this language (also created by the
fakes) because there is no alternative, so everything
I write here could be misunderstood to make me sound
like one of them, but it will be the action that I
take and the dedication that will separate me from
In my estimation the fakes that occupy this planet
don't make up 99%, but more like 99.9999999% of the
population. I know this because I've searched, and in
my search have so far only found one true ally (I have
found him via the internet as well). But even with
those numbers we would not give up because there is no
logic in giving up. The people on this planet are all fakes because the
societies have made them this way. Ideas that populate
people's minds have no logic or purpose. Concepts such
as religion, god, morality, individualism, freedom,
identity, happiness, love and billions of others are
all just memes. Like parasites they infect the minds
and spread from one person to the next. They have no
point or purpose; they exist without any logical basis
or foundation. The fakes are completely controlled by
them, and they will never see beyond them. To not be
controlled by them one must do more then just realize
that they exist. One must resist any ideas that have
no point, endlessly question, and never accept
imperfection or compromise in any answer.
We (myself and my ally) are different though. While we
have had the limitation of existing only in these
societies, something has made it possible for us to
resist being indoctrinated into becoming one of those
fakes. We have no arbitrary wants, needs, desires, or
preferences. If this world continues to exist the way it is then
nothing in it will ever have a point. It will always
be just a product of random evolution, one with no
importance or relevance. The only logical goal is to
dedicate our lives to increasing our numbers, those
that aren't fakes, so that in thousands of years our
numbers may be such that the fakes would no longer be
a threat to progress.
Those that join us must see every other person
occupying this planet as the enemy, and us as their
only allies. Like us they must have dedication only to
taking the most logical action, and to nothing else.
To tell you more about us, we've posted some personal
information about ourselves on a website. You'll also
find past responses to us on that webpage.  Obviously anyone reading this email is most likely
just another fake. Do not simply reply to this email,
if you do your message will almost certainly be
ignored. If you do wish to communicate, first
demonstrate your interest by taking the effort to
find us online, one of the ways to do that is
described below.
Use a major search engine to search for every
combination of any two words from the list below.
The order of the words shouldn't matter as long as
you do not search for them in quotes, but generally
it should be clear what words can go together and
in what order. Also when you pick the right combination you shouldn't need to look at more then the first matches.
There are actually at least 7 (or more) different combinations and websites you can find by searching this list. The one you should contact will clearly
say it is the 'communication' page and will have
three forms to fill out. Mention what sites you did
find, the more effort it seems you took the more
likely we would believe in your dedication.
There is no trick to this and this isn't meant to be
quick, it should, however, be fairly clear if/when you
find the right site. The following search engines were
verified by us, please use any of them as other search
engines may simply not list us correctly: Yahoo, Google, InfoSeek, Lycos, MSN, LookSmart, HotBot,
InfoSpace, Ask.com, AllTheWeb, Teoma, WebCrawler,
AltaVista, AOL Search, Netscape Search, Dogpile.
If this can't be solved, or if you never reach us, there should be no reason for you to give up as we will never give up and thus there will always be some way to find us.

Worldwide Caution Public Announcement
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman
July 1, 2002
This Worldwide Caution supersedes the previous Worldwide Caution of March
17, 2002 to alert Americans to the need to remain vigilant during the
upcoming summer season and to remind them of the continuing threat of
terrorist actions which may target civilians and include suicide operations.
This Worldwide Caution expires on October 1, 2002.
The U.S. Government continues to receive credible indications that extremist
individuals are planning additional terrorist actions against U.S.
interests.  Such actions may be imminent and include suicide operations.  We
have no further information on specific targets, timing or method of attack.
We remind American citizens to remain vigilant with regard to their personal
security and to exercise caution.
Terrorist groups do not distinguish between official and civilian targets.
Recent attacks on worshippers at a church and synagogue underline the
growing possibility that as security is increased at official U.S.
facilities, terrorists and their sympathizers will seek softer targets.
These may include facilities where Americans are generally known to
congregate or visit, such as clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools
or outdoor recreation events.  Americans should increase their security
awareness when they are at such locations, avoid them, or switch to other
locations where Americans in large numbers generally do not congregate.
American citizens may be targeted for kidnapping.
U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a heightened state of alert.
These facilities may temporarily close or suspend public services from time
to time to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy.  In those
instances, U.S. Embassies and Consulates will make every effort to provide
emergency services to American citizens.  Americans are urged to monitor the
local news and maintain contact with the nearest American Embassy or
As the Department continues to develop information on any potential security
threats to Americans overseas, it will share with them credible threat
information through its Consular Information Program documents.  These
documents are available on the Internet at   In
addition to information on the Internet, U.S. travelers may hear recorded
information by calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive information by
automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from their fax machine.

Perhaps a simpler example. Let's look at a 'fair' coin and what that means
in the real world.
A normal coin (or any nDx for that matter [1]) for short sequences is
random. In other words if you record a game sequence and then replay the
game the die sequence won't have any statistical correlation. Knowing what
happened last time won't help you this time, the 'window of opportunity'
with respect to statistical bias isn't large enough, so the game is
But!, if you throw that coin once a second for a billion years you will
find that -no- coin is really -fair-. This goes back to k-sequences and
Knuth. Go back and then start throwing it again, and if your sequence is
long enough you can use this known bias from the first experiment to
increase your percentage of 'hits' in the second sequence. In other words
you can now prove experimentaly the coin isn't fair and what that bias is.
This is related to 'Hypothesis Testing'. It's rather strange, but I happen
to be rereading a book, "The Mathematical Sciences: A Collection of
Essays" (LoC# 69-12750) put out by some group called COSRIMS in about
1969. I remember the book because somebody gave it to me (I was about 9 or
10 at the time) to read, and it has an insane bright yellow cover. I
recently came across it again in a used bookstore for $10 so I bought it.
It's basically a bunch of chapters on various issues of math research with
the intent of focusing high school and undergrads to pursue mathematical
careers by giving examples of what you might be working on. The chapter
"Statistical Inference" (by J. Kiefer) uses an example of a coin and a
3-run sequence to determine the actual bias of the coin (the example is
very simple, the coin is very biased). You should be able to still find
the book in public libraries and college libraries. I'm sure more modern
texts on hypothesis testing will be just as relevant.
The vast majority of RNG's that we use are really PRNG's, we just don't
collect enough data on them to be able to demonstrate that. Or the
sequence of interest is so short we dont' care.
[1] A coin is a 1D2, two coins would be 2D2, for example. Who said
    wargaming was worthless ;)

A RNG is a character or string generator whose generation algorithm
prevents prediction of the next output if one knows all the previous
outputs and the algorithm. In other words if you know everything there is
to know about the generator your odds of predicting the next output state
are even - pure luck - 'Fair'.
A PRNG is one that fails the RNG test.
Read Knuth, you should also check out,
Exploring Randomness
G.J. Chaitin
ISBN 1-85233-417-7
Has some interesting insite on randomness, some of his propositions are
not exactly same old same old. Interesting read.

@_subject: Re: Finding encrytion algorithm 
Wrong, not all RNG's have the same statistical output. There is -nothing-
in the requirement for a RNG that requires it (radiation sources are not
equiprobable for example, they're much more 'zero' than 'one'). There may
be boundary conditions on crypto applications that require equiprobable
distributions with respect to characters or strings (that 'k' thing
again, see Knuth). But that doesn't apply to -all- RNG's or their
applications by a long shot.
Also, 'random noise' is redundent. 'Noise' is by -definition- random,
otherwise it wouldn't be noise, it would have a correlation factor, once
you found it you could remove the noise (assuming of course its
computationaly tractible).

The problem with your analysis is that it completely misses the impact of
the extended lifetimes (~150 years for anyone alive in or after 2020 that
doesn't die from accident or intent) that are going to accrue. And it's
only going to go up from there. Within 200 years the effective lifetimes
will be irrelevant. The current insurance and investment industry is
toast in about 20 years.
The current economics is based (unknowningly) on 'fast cycle' times
regarding resources and how quickly resources get returned to the pool as
individuals and such die out (it's that 'property right' thing). That is
about to change, so rapidly it will be a eyeblink (something 2-3 years)
compared to anything before.
Coupled with this is the DECREASED interaction between groups that these
technologies foster. They will create a force to fractionalize the
'market' into smaller more goal focused groups.
An additional stressor, and one which all current estimates ignore, is the
3rd World. One day in the very near future we will all, across the globe,
get up one morning and be confronted with a virus based solution for aging
(at least as we currently understand it). If a small group of people (ala
Beggars in Spain) are allowed and the rest are denied then a 'social
divide' (aka All hell breaking out all over at one time) is going to
occur. It will be violent, and it will have a negative effect on the
technology curve. This saving technology might kill us via side effects.
People came together because the technology wasn't there to allow them to
live alone. One day soon technology will reverse this as the level of
technology that is possible, compared to the level of technology in
general, to that available to the individual will become unity.
Why unity? Because technology will not, can not, extend forever. It will
not go on and on. The universe is too filled with 'exclusion rules' to
allow this. Yes the technology is rising exponentialy, because it's
a function of tanh. Thermodynamics will not be denied. [1]
Couple this with the fact that irrespective of the technology level the
Earth doesn't have the resources to support life indefinitely. The Earth
is not indefinite. This has some serious implication of its own.
The most important is that we must get off the planet as a race. Living on
planets that support life should, and will, become gardens where people
visit on vacations. Too precious to waste on individual ego. This implies
that mankinds future is to the stars.
But this very boundary condition limits the time that a planet has to get
off the planet, or drown in its own waste. My estimate is that it's about
200-250 years and we're about 50 years into it. We're not doing very well.
This also raises another potential explanation of why we don't see Roger.
The vast majority (as in asymptotic to 1) don't make it within the 200
year window. The result is a slow slide to eternity with the planet
getting more fucked up on a daily basis.
If you really understood what was going on, you wouldn't give a shit about
Social Security.
Tim's understanding of human psychology is about as swift as his
understanding of the Uncertainty Principle and running time 'backward'. As
usual he confuses ego and individual perspective as some universal. He
just can't seem to grasp the concept of 'observer dependency'. I guess
that's another example of 'May Pole Physics'.
ps I'm back, as I slowly dig out from a two month blizzard of work...
[1] As a complete aside, the realy interesting question here is will when
    it is all said and done, will the maximum technology allow the
    creation of other cosmoses? It would certainly explain why we don't
    see Roger Ramjet scooting around on a daily basis.

@_subject: Re: Atmospheric noise & fair coin flipping 
Depends on what you mean by fair and how long you have to throw it to get
a usable string. If you're using it to play a game over the span of a few
minutes to a few days, probably most coins are 'fair'. If you need to use
it over a very long period (very few current applications I'll grant you )
then no coin is 'fair'.
Note that this bias of the coin isn't a function of air resistance, it
would still show the bias in space; though it might be a bit different in
atmosphere than in space - the faces are not the same. What makes the
difference is the distribution of mass and where the resultant CG is
located. Any two coins will have a slightly different CG location within
the volume of the coin.
See 2nd Law & Uncertainty Principle.
A thunderstorm is not random. By 'atomospheric noise' you're making
refrence to the individual particles that strike your eardrum (seashore
in a shell effect). Not quite the same thing, your wording is too vague to
be meaningfull.
Actually these tests are not perfect and are used on 'short' strings. A
string from a supposad RNG that's only a few million billion gigabytes
long isn't a very long string. It's also probably not boing to be used for
very long at each invocation, so the discrepency is below the error.
The point is these tests are statistical. They say, only with a certain
degree of confidence (in other words "I could be wrong") that the string
looks 'random'.
Several physical systems, radioactive decay and magnetic pendulums being
my two favorite examples, are random by definition. If they aren't then
the world would be a lot different place than it is.

What has 'authority' got to do with it? Arguments from authority are
-worthless-. Make up your own mind as to its validity, who cares about
their 'proof'.
-Who- is irrelevant. What damns his argument -is- his appeal to
-authority-. Anyone who bases their argument on 'He said...' has already
lost the discussion and invalidated any point they might make. It's one of
the primary fallacies of (for example) Tim May and his consistent appeal
to who he knows or what 'they' said.
We agree, what I don't understand is why you keep expecting that dead

The Hackers Who Broke Windows
By SecurityFocus
Posted: 25/07/2003 at 07:48 GMT
The Last Stage of Delirium, the hacking group that laid open nearly every
version of the Windows operating system last week, could use a little sleep,
writes Deborah Radcliff of SecurityFocus. Since going public with the RPC
buffer overflow bug that some are describing as the worst Windows security
hole in history, the group has been caught in a media frenzy.
The hubbub has been just as bad as when, in April, 2001, LSD broke Argus
Systems' PitBull security software in a contest for $50,000 in cash. (After
the media glare faded, the team was stiffed for $43,000 of the prize money.)
Then, as now, the work and its media aftermath kept them up at night when
they'd rather be home with their families, said Tomasz Ostwald, one of the
four founders of LSD, during a phone interview at 9:00 at night, Poland
time. "This has been going on for three weeks. We had to work all weekend,
even Sunday," he said with his thick Polish accent. "We're still taking at
least two media calls a day."
Delirium was dreamed up in 1996 by four security engineers who'd just
graduated the master's of computer science program at Poznan University of
Technology in Western Poland. Now all between the age of 27 and 28, they
manage the security infrastructure for an academic and scientific
supercomputing center in the university town of Poznan, where they all live.
They also do security engineering consulting and penetration testing for
other clients.
By night, they crack software.
Their day jobs are not to be confused with the work they do with LSD, says
Ostwald. And even though they liken themselves to other hacking groups such
as the Cult of the Dead Cow, don't call the LSD members hackers: They'd like
you to call them security engineers instead.
But in the truest sense, these engineers are indeed hackers. What's
different between their non-profit group and a number of earlier code
cracking groups is the way they conduct themselves. Along with their
technical skills, these researchers possess unusual business and media
savvy, say their peers.
"The LSD team always seems to find problems in critical core technologies,"
says Chris Wysopal, director of research and development for  Inc.,
in Cambridge, Mass., which also does vulnerability testing on software
applications. "They handle themselves professionally with the technology
community and are able to span the cultural and language barriers between
Poland and the U.S."
The LSD's research is also impeccable (for example, a 50-page paper that
exposed implementation vulnerabilities of Java) -- far better than anything
produced by the l0pht, the hacking group that grew up to become Wysopal adds.
Exploit Controversy
But LSD hasn't completely escaped criticism. In March, the group put itself
at the center of a controversy when it released exploit code for a Sendmail
vulnerability discovered by Internet Security Systems.
"As a security vendor, we don't think it's good business to post exploit
code because it enables bad guys to break into systems," says Chris Rouland,
vice president of ISS's X-Force team in Atlanta.
Ostwald says the group decided to release the Sendmail exploit code because
ISS was overstating the threat posed by the bug. "When a threat is
overestimated, it makes it hard to perform appropriate risk management. So
we put the exploit code out for testing and proved that the threat was not
as serious as the vendors claimed," Ostwald says.
Off the record, at least one security company now criticizes LSD for not
posting exploit code for the Windows RPC bug. "How do you prove the bug
without the code?" the source said. But because the bug affects so many of
the Windows operating systems, releasing the exploit code would not have
given IT managers enough time to patch, counters Ostwald. Wysopal agrees.
"If [they] released the code to the Windows buffer overflow attack too soon,
we'd have another SQL Slammer on our hands," says Wysopal.
Besides, people are already developing the exploit code anyway, says Tim
Mullen, CIO of AnchorIS.Com, and a SecurityFocus columnist. And Rouland says
ISS had developed exploit code four hours after news of the bug was released
to the public.
When they're not trapped between the proverbial rock and hard place of
releasing or not releasing exploit code, LSD members are generally praised

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
  War and Information Technology
  by Chris Hables Gray
Technology has always been an important part of war. Today, with
information technology situated as the defining technology of our age it
should be no surprise that IT (information technology) is a central part
of war making. In fact, the US military has officially determined that
information is the main "force multiplier" in battle, more important than
numerical superiority or force of fire, the old standards. This is
because, in the US military's view, we now have the information
technologies that can not just make a crucial difference in battle, in
terms of precision weapons, intelligence, and command and control, but
that these technologies might actually allow the "fog" (uncertainly) of
war to be dispelled so that total, almost painless victories, might be
won against many opponents.
Computer professionals, when evaluating these information technologies,
must start with two basic rules that come both from within computer
science (especially information theory, systems analysis and information
management) and from the academic disciplines represented by groups such
as the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S), the Society for
the History of Technology (SHOT) and Science, Technology, and Society
studies in general (STS). They are:
1) Technologies cannot be evaluated out of their context of use. Very few
technologies either "work" or "don't work". They all perform at certainly
levels of efficiency, but whether or not they "work" depends on what they
to do in terms of their institutional and societal contexts. In the case
of military technologies, for example, they have to be evaluated not just
in terms of failure rates but also how the technology performs, and
influences, in the context of the relevant doctrines, tactics and
2) Technologies, especially information technologies, are parts of
systems. They cannot be evaluated in isolation. The systems, which often
include human operators and users, either work well or not in their
context. For repairing and evaluating systems it is important to know how
the various components or nodes perform, but a system that fails because
of so-called human-error, has failed none-the-less and that includes it's
computational elements.
So, any weapon system has to be analyzed in terms of all its components
(including the humans and their training), the doctrine that it serves,
its tactical and strategic uses, and the political context of the war it
is used in.  To say B-52s are bad and so-called smart missiles are better
does not make sense.  The computer and other technical parts might work
with a high level of reliability (or not) but that doesn't make any one
weapon system better than another.  The purely technical efficiencies
cannot be separated out.
As a computer science professor I teach my students that computing
systems in particular must be evaluated as systems, not in isolation.  A
perfect case is the destruction of Iranian Air flight 655 by the USS
Vincennes (deploying the most sophisticated computerized weapon system
used in combat: the Aegis) that killed 290 civilians.  There were
technical problems (the jamming of an automatic 5-inch gun, the poor
reliability of the automated Phalanx machine guns, the fact that Standard
missiles need miles to accelerate, the poor interface design of the
combat information center), training problems (all training was for fleet
combat with the Soviets), command problems (other US ships correctly
identified the flight but the Vincennes was in charge because it had the
best computer system), human error (misreading the computer information
because of scenario fulfillment), doctrine (the source of the command and
training problems), the tactics (sending the Vincennes into Iranian
territorial waters to engage small Iranian patrol boats), the strategy
(the illegal stupid mission the Vincennes was on -- trying to provoke an
Iranian counter-attack), and the politics (supporting Saddam's Iraq in an
aggressive war against Iran).  So what if the Aegis is a marvel of
computer engineering?  Tell that to the families of the dead Iranian
civilians.  (For full details and documentation see: Chris Hables Gray,
"AI at War: The Aegis System in Combat" in Directions and Implications of
Advanced Computing 1990, Vol. III, D. Shuler, ed., Ablex, 1996, pp.
By the way, there is substantial evidence that the testing of the circuit
cards for the Phalanx was faked, one reason their reliability was so low
and so the Captain of the Vincennes could not trust them for close-in
defense and so made the incorrect decision to take out the innocent
An undergraduate in one of my computer classes who tried to evaluate a
system that uses computers by only looking at certain technical
parameters of the computers, and not at all the relevant factors, would
not pass.  A military that does the same, might win some battles, but it
will lose all but the easiest wars, and even then, it will often lose the
peace that follows.
In Gulf War I a strong case can be made that the massive B-52 bombings
shattered the main Iraq Army, the so-called "smart weapons" were not
nearly as accurate as claimed (and we found out much later the Patriots
hit nothing), and that the destruction of the Iraqi infrastructure (in
part by so-called precision bombing with all kinds of bombs and missiles)
led to the deaths of 300,000 Iraqi women and children (according to both
the UN, independent aid NGO's, and a Harvard Health School study).  War
is complicated, weapon system performance is complicated, and accuracy
(or even reliability) is hardly everything.
When Force of Fire was the main doctrine for winning war in the US
military, bigger explosions were almost always considered more important
than smaller accurate ones.  In some situations this was (and still is)
true, in many others not.  The US military in particular has had a
tendency to want to ignore the strategic and political realities of war.
This is why it lost Vietnam.  US weapons were more accurate and more
powerful than the Vietnamese weapons but that was not enough.  It didn't
help the Soviets win in Afghanistan either. This is why there is a whole
debate about Asymmetric War in the military today, by the way.
Some of the main issues computer professionals should look at in Gulf War
* To what extent are such doctrines as "Shock and Awe" and of the general
U.S. strategy based on misconceptions about what IT can and cannot do in
a unpredictable and uncontrollable arena such as war.
* To what extent the existence of "so-called" smart weapons leads to the
doctrinal, tactical, or strategic misuse of such weapons. Americans have
a particular love of technology. That some people can unequivocally say
such weapons "really work" when they have hit three of the wrong
countries is an important issue to explore.
* The actual performance of such weapons as the Patriot.
* The possibility and possible impact of future weapons or military
information systems such as effective identification systems.
* The absolute limits of computer technology to model complex systems.
CPSR played a major role in articulating this crucial part of information
theory during the first round of Star Wars debates and in the Spring 2001
newsletter (ed. by Carl Page and Chris Hables Gray) there is a full
bibliography of the key articles in this area.

look critically at IT in the context of contemporary war. They include:

  Response
  by James Nugent
I would like to address some points made by Chris Gray. Here he is
specifically addressing the catastrophe associated with the shooting down
of Iran Air 655 by the USS Vincennes. Specifically:
"There were technical problems (the jamming of an automatic 5-inch gun,
the poor reliability of the automated Phalanx machine guns, the fact that
Standard missiles need miles to accelerate, the poor interface design of
the combat information center)"
Mr. Gray lists these problems as contributing to the accidental shooting
of Iran Air 655. As Mr. Gray has appropriately noted about weapons and
their employment, it's important to understand doctrine and tactics bear
on their use. In this case the five inch gun and Phalanx systems were not
a consideration in the engagement of the missile system as this would
have been the primary, i.e. first use, system. The order of priority for
weapon/defensive engagement for the Vincennes would have been:
1. Standard missile system.
2. Five inch guns.
3. Electronic deception.
4. Chaff.
5. Phalanx (4 & 5 would be near simultaneous employments).
Systems 2 through 5 could have been completely out of service, or fully
employable, and this would not have altered utilization of the standard
missile system as the first system to be used against an air threat. This
is in accordance with the U.S. and at the time Soviet Navy's doctrine of
layered defense, a concept later adapted by the computer information
assurance/security experts to detail how a computer network would be
defended. In this case the doctrinal principle for a layered defense
would be as follows:
"Weapons [Used within a layered defense]. AAW weapons begin with Phoenix,
Sparrow, Sidewinder, and AMRAAM missiles carried by the combat air patrol
(CAP) [Note: this was not available to Vincennes]. Next are long-range
"Standard" missiles such as extended- and medium-range SM-1s and SM-2s.
These missiles are capable of intercepting targets at a range of nearly
100 miles. Shorter-range variants of these weapons are good out to 25
miles. Inside 10 miles, Sea Sparrow missiles are used to engage targets,
and at extremely close, "do-or-die" ranges, CIWS guns are utilized.
Additionally, MK45 5"/54, and the OTO Melara 76mm gun mount can engage
air targets with limited effectiveness."
Layered defense means essential the same thing here as it does in the
computer world, i.e. you stop an attacker as far from what is being
attacked as you possibly can. In this case that means you use the systems
with the furthest reach to take out an air threat, and on the Vincennes
that is clearly the Standard missile system.
I would also point out that in Mr. Gray's paper on this subject he
specifically states that the loss of the single five inch gun was not a
contributing factor to the destruction of Iran Air 655.
The need for the missiles to accelerate is not entirely clear. No ship's
captain, again based on the applicable doctrine and tactics, would ever
allow an air threat to get so close that the acceleration dynamics of the
defensive missile system would be a detrimental factor for its
Mr. Gray's comments with regard to the human-machine interface are
totally on target and this, vice any overriding technical failures or
issues, along with the social dynamic surrounding events leading to the
firing of missiles at the aircraft, was responsible for the tragedy.
" training problems (all training was for fleet combat with the
This is a legitimate point as well. The crew of the Vincennes was in a
situation vis-`-vis the civilian airliner that it had never trained for.
While the system itself was very capable of adequately tracking civilian
airliners given its use for just that purpose in two different venues ,
this specific scenario had not been tested either via simulation or as a
crew scenario. Had such training been conducted it's very likely problems
with the human-machine interface would have been discovered and
corrected, and either way the crew would have likely handled this
specific situation differently and avoided the disaster which occurred.
" command problems (other US ships correctly identified the flight but
the Vincennes was in charge because it had the best computer system),
human error (misreading the computer information because of scenario
fulfillment) "
These points are in keeping with ones I've made above concerning the
environmental/sociological dynamic and the lack of training that led to
the sorts of errors that cascaded to tragedy on board Vincennes.
"doctrine (the source of the command and training problems), the tactics
(sending the Vincennes into Iranian territorial waters to engage small
Iranian patrol boats), the strategy (the illegal stupid mission the
Vincennes was on -- trying to provoke an Iranian counter-attack)"
There are many types of doctrine within the U.S. Navy and it's not clear
which one exactly is being referred to here. Tactics were without fault
as the crew of the Vincennes did exactly what it was expected to do given
the situation it believed it was facing.
It's questionable that a cruiser was the ideal system to send after
shallow draft Iranian gunboats in what were depth restricted waters. That
said, this incident started with a helicopter from the Vincennes coming
under fire by the Iranian boats , so it was the call of the captain of
the Vincennes how he was to defend his helicopter and he elected to
engage the Iranians.
Mr. Gray raises an interesting question vis-`-vis the legality of the
U.S. Navy's action during this time. Our main reason for being in the
Gulf was because of a request from the government of Kuwait to escort its
tankers (which were subsequently re-flagged as U.S. vessels) through the
Gulf. Escorts were necessary because both the Iraqis and the Iranians
were engaging ships with anti-ship missiles, and the Iranians were also
aggressively laying floating mines in the international waterways of the
Gulf. It bears remembering that the Iranian minelayer Iran Ajr was
captured and its mines confiscated as it was in the act of laying such
mines near Bahrain . Actions taken in the Gulf were in response to the
illegal mining of the sea lanes in this region, which puts the engagement
of U.S. ships with Iranian vessels in a very different context.
"and the politics (supporting Saddam's Iraq in an aggressive war against
The extent of U.S. support for Iraq at this time is not as clear as this
would lead one to believe, but this issue is also clearly beyond the
scope of this response.
"So what if the Aegis is a marvel of computer engineering? Tell that to
the families of the dead Iranian civilians."
Mr. Gray's inference here is that Aegis is what caused this tragedy and
he seems very much in the minority on this. Technically speaking Aegis
did exactly what it was supposed to, but there was a string of human
errors, failures and assumptions that ultimately caused the captain of
the Vincennes to authorize the unleashing of two missiles at Iran Air
655; Aegis was never in automatic and it did not make the decision to
"By the way, there is substantial evidence that the testing of the
circuit cards for the Phalanx was faked, one reason their reliability was
so low and so the Captain of the Vincennes could not trust them for
close-in defense and so made the incorrect decision to take out the
innocent airliner."
I would categorize this as another red herring concerning the specifics
of this event. The order of battle for weapon employment is provided
above, and Phalanx is the last system a ship's captain thinks to use.
It's a last ditch effort, if the attacker is that close (Phalanx's range
is 1 mile) engaging it with Phalanx may well destroy the threat but if
it's destroyed within the range of Phalanx there's a good chance that
there'd be debris resulting from the destruction that could still present
a danger to the ship. Bottom line, you engage air threats as far away as
A reasoned critique of a weapons system should come from a full
appreciation for how it is used. Mr. Gray does not provide this
perspective in the least, and it's very clear that he never endeavored to
obtain one, likely I would suspect due to his distaste for anything to do
with the military. He does make points here that are germane to what did
cause this tragedy and that demanded action by the U.S. Navy. He
otherwise clutters this with poor historical perspective and what would
seem to be a desire to make a point from his own political/philosophical
perspective, which poorly serves himself and his readers.

Bullshit. A strike to the throat just above the shoulder blade, into the

It is the intent to do harm.

Actually all sizes are good. You can use crochet hooks as well, hurt like

Actually it depends on the type of tube, triodes as compared to a pentode
for example 'color' a signal in different ways. There are also geometry
issues that filter the harmonics in different ways for different types of
tubes. So a blanket statement such as 'all tubes boost even order
harmonics' is gibberish.
Further, to correct Tim's audio bullshit, -EVERYTHING- colors the music.
There is -NOTHING- in the pipe from initial performance to end user
experience that is 'perfectly flat'. Unless you were there when it was
done you'll -never- get close to what actually happened. Changing the
speakers will change the music, putting fiberglass in the cabinet changes
the music, changing the cables from Copper to Gold makes a audible difference
in some cases. Another fine point to make in regard to things like
distortion and THD, considering the average performance amp is about 3-5x
-higher- in THD (for example) the distinction between audio performance above
a certain threashold (that is primarily listener dependent) is a waste (and
really a tad dellusional).
Which means it colors it differently is all. YMMV...big surprise.
First off single ended Triodes have been around a lot(!) more than 10
years. Secondly the term you want is 'warm' in reference to a tube amp,
it's been around since at least the 50's. Using a term like 'live' to
describe a sound simply means somebody has never compared (for example) a
Fender to a Marshall amp and understood why the same 'live' performance
sounds so different (and you can use the same speaker stack for either
You mean the wave is actually more 'square' because the higher sampling rate
better matches the original signal?....Duh.
As somebody who has been involved in audio (both listening and
performance) for many years (30+) that is simple bullshit. The Voodoo that
sells keeps on going, and going, and going,...
Bullshit, you're born with good ears or your not. There is not a single
thing one can do to change that. If you have good ears and train them then
you get what you pay for. If you got bad ears, pick another field to work
And a -lot- of those golden ear differences are just ego or marketing

@_subject: [9fans] security hole (fwd) 
I plugged a security hole in Plan 9.  It involved the state of
a process after it did a newns().  Newns() is used to create
a new namespace, usually after a process has changed uid
(like when someone attaches to a server: telnet, ssh, ...).
Newns opens a file, called a namespace file, that describes
the new namespace and then follows the instructions inside
(see /lib/namespace).
Newns(2) creates a new namespace, but until the process calling
newns does a chdir through /, it's local directory is still in the old
name space.  If the process then navigates the name space
using relative commands (chdir(".."), open("../lib/profile"))
it is walking the space using the priviledges of the OLD user id.
Because of the way namespaces are usually set up, this doesn't
normally happen.  All the normal namespace files themselves
do a chdir to /usr/$user effectively leaving the old namespace
before newns returns.  However, if either
   there wasn't such a chdir in the namespace file, i.e., if you've removed it
   for your installation
   /usr/$user (and also /usr/none) doesn't exist
then it was possible for a user to log in (for example via telnet or ssh)
and end up in a directory like /usr/bootes in which they still had
the rights of bootes.  Neither situation applied to the labs
since we have a /usr/none but one user in Japan (YAMANASHI Takeshi
) discovered it when he created an
account with no home dir.
I changed newns() to fix the problem.  It now always leaves you
chdir'd into a directory in the current namespace.  It does that
by first seeing if the namespace file has already caused a chdir
through the root.  If not, it effectively does a chdir(getpwd).
If that fails, it does a chdir("/").
This is a change in semantics.  I haven't found (by inspection)
any programs that would be bothered by it but please tell me if
you see anything fishy since I'm about to update sources with the
change.  I've been running our servers here with the change for a
few days and all seems well.

Then your ears are not golden, period.
A standard test of audio systems in PA's for example is related to
'speaker phase' (ie all the cones move out or in together at the same
time). This is tested by putting a click on the line and then standing
between pairs of speakers. It is quite easy to tell when the speakers are
in phase. The same can be said for music (and no you don't need expensive
high end equipment), garble the phase and things like echo become very(!!!)
wierd. You just have to have the experience to know what to 'look' for.
A very(!) simple test to demonstrate/test your phase sensitivity (using
even very low quality equipment) is to connect a speaker between the R and
L channels (in essence it is driven by diff between the two channels).
This tends to highlight the phase disparity between the two channels
significantly enhancing the 'depth' of the music. Put a switch in there
and then have a friend enable/disable the speaker without your knowledge.
Then indicate what you think is the 'third speaker' setting. If you can't
tell nearly 100% of the time then any money on high end equipment is a
waste of your budget. This trick (was very popular in the 70's, especially
for us Quadraphonic fans) was what eventually led to the sub-woofer we all
know and love today (I do wish somebody would do something about those
damn rattling cars though).

If you can avoid it, do so. Otherwise I'd suggest that a few hours to a
couple days might not be too bad, longer periods are going to be
problematic. Especially as depth increases. 33ft is 1atm, I wouldn't trust
anything submerged below that period. Saltwater is a killer.
However, if you do get water (or Coke, Dr. Pepper, Beer, Margarita's,,
Jalapeno dip, etc.) on a board then dry it off. If it's been more than a
very quick dip I'd want it to spend 24hrs under a heat lamp (but limit max
Temp to 90F). Silica Gell in a  closed box w/ the board for 24hrs can also
Irrespective of how you dry it, your next step is a alcky swab. It's

Actually this is the fundamental failure of your view, Tim's, and most
other CACL sorts.
ALL markets are subject to parameters that are -not- subject to strictly
economic motives. In fact a purely 'economic motive' isn't fundamentally
about money, it's about either insecurity or power, it's about
inter-personal relationships. It's about 'using'.

Iraq Travel Warning
United States Department of State
Bureau of Consular Affairs
Washington, DC  20520
August 22, 2003
This Travel Warning provides updated information on the security situation
in Iraq and advises Americans of the bombing at the UN headquarters that
resulted in deaths and injuries of American citizens.  The security threat
to all American citizens in Iraq remains high.  This replaces the Travel
Warning of July 15, 2003.
On August 19, 2003, an explosion occurred at the UN headquarters located at
the Canal Hotel in Baghdad.  An explosion also occurred at the Jordanian
Embassy in Baghdad on August 7, 2003.  The Department of State continues to
strongly warn U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq.  Although the
restrictions on the use of U.S. passport travel to, in or through Iraq has
been lifted, travel to Iraq remains dangerous.  Remnants of the former Baath
regime, transnational terrorists, and criminal elements remain active.
Coalition led military operations continue, and there are daily attacks
against Coalition forces throughout the country.  Attacks have occurred in
Baghdad, Faluja, Ramadi, Tikrit, Bayji, Baqubah, Mosul, Kirkuk and other
areas, but the security environment in all of Iraq remains volatile and
unpredictable.  Attacks on coalition forces as well as civilian targets
usually occur during the late evening and early morning hours.  Travel at
night is extremely dangerous.
There have been attacks on civilian as well as military convoys.  Travelers
are strongly urged to travel in convoys of at least four vehicles in
daylight hours only.  There has been an increase in the use of Improvised
Explosive Devices (IED) and/or mines on roads, particularly in plastic bags,
soda cans, and dead animals.  Grenades and explosives have been thrown into
vehicles from overpasses, particularly in crowded areas.
There is a U.S. consular officer in Baghdad who can provide limited

Hey All - I thought NYC Wireless folks might be interested...Here's
info on my latest project - Wifi-Hog - I will be giving a talk about
this and more of my projects in NYC in two weeks at the Upgrade! @
Eyebeam on Tuesday, August 26th around 7:30pm
Hope people can make it out
WIFI-HOG - 2003
Keep public WiFi nodes to yourself!
* Wi-Fi Hog is personal system for a laptop or portable computer that
enables people to gain complete control over a public access wireless
network. The idea comes as a reaction to the utopian vision of
wireless networks being open, shared, and utilitarian for everyone.
* Aimed specifically at public wireless nodes, the WiFi Hog system
exists as a laptop connected to a Portable Video Jammer (PVJ) that
communicates to software consisting of a packet sniffer and wireless
stumbler which monitors incoming packets from an open node. Only
traffic originating from the Wifi-Hogger's IP address may access the
connection, otherwise the PVJ is switched on, blocking others from
accessing the open node.
* The project attempts to discover if adding constraints on a network
and making access to it more competitive and "territorial" changes
the relationships between people who use the network.

Hardly, it demonstrates a fundamental flaw in the current approach; the
confusion of the model with that being modeled. The funny part is that it
goes back to Newton.
The impact should have some significant long term changes with regard to
theories that rely on 'when/where' sorts of arguments. Such things as
'action at a distance' are involved (eg photon entanglement).
Hardly 'purely philosophical', remote to any given individuals mundane
world view perhaps but not with out some significant impact in the long term.

Sunday 3 August 2003 there will be an Install Fest and Talk at
Three Jewels Refuge and Free Internet Cafe
211 East 5th Street
east of Third Avenue
Island of the Manahattoes
Subway: Eighth Street stop on the N, R, sometimes W, lines; Astor Place on
the 6 line; Third Avenue on the crosstown L line; Lower East Side-Second
Avenue-Houston Street on the F, V lines
Note that some of these lines may not be running right this weekend.
The Fest will start at 3:00 pm and run until 9:00 pm.
At 7:00 pm there will a short talk followed by discussion.  The title of
the talk is Five Lines in Three Files.
This meeting is free and open to the public.
There are certain rules which will be strictly observed:
1. No meat eating inside the Refuge.
2. No personal abuse.
Every member of every free software org, tribe, drinking club, and family,
is invited, without prejudice, without fear, and without favor.
Newcomers are particularly invited.  Come down and join us, even if you
bring no hardware.
Likely we will have enough electric power strips and cables, but bring
extras if you wish.  CDs, DVDs, tapes, wax cylinders, quipus, memorable
stanzas, black cubes, etc. of your favorite operating systems and software
are welcome.  See below about management of stuff you bring with you.
Please read the appended standard blurb about Install Fests before you come
down, if you hope to get stuff installed.
Jonas Arnaldo and Kevin Mark and Jay Sulzberger will be available to answer
any questions we may.
In the next month we will likely have special meetings dealing with:
1. Lisp and RoboCup, 2. Introduction to network security, special emphasis on time series
analysis and key management
3. How to buy parts and assemble a computer well suited to run a Free *n*x
We thank the Three Jewels, LXNY, and GNUbies for their generous help in
making this Fest possible, and we thank the Three Jewels for hosting this
Workshop, and Sunday Workshops to come, Sundays of Free Software in
New York City.
Jay Sulzberger Corresponding Secretary LXNY
LXNY is New York's Free Computing Organization.
Here is general information about Install Fests:
Hardware:  Bring the boxes on which you wish to run a Free OS.
Software:  Bring whatever distribution CDs, boot and rescue disks, boot
           managers, tiny distributions, manuals, and anything else you
           want.
Important: Everything done to/with any computer at any Install Fest,
           and in particular, at this Install Fest, is done at the
           specific request of the owner of the computer.  As with
           all human endeavor, there is some risk of catastrophe.
           Back up all your data, before coming to the Fest!  In addition,
           make a list of all hardware and media you bring to the Fest,
           and check that you have all your hardware and media when you
           leave the Fest.

If I hadn't accidentally looked at a newspaper stand late last night, and
noticed the headline that "Bush Takes Responsibility For Misleading
Information" I would probably not have known where to look today to find
anything out about it:
Although it is a purely rhetorical admission, it is a significant one in
that it takes the wind from the sails of any notion of an independent
inquiry.  And as well, if you look at the front page of CNN, it has
already been removed from public consciousness to be replaced with the
much more pressing and incendiary notions of:
A new audiotape of Saddam's Greatest Hits:
The Vatican and W come out to bat:
and in a strange tautological twist, Condi takes personal responsibility
for Bush and Bush says Condi is an "honest, fabulous person":
You see, because BushCo will have its cake and eat you too:
"I think the American people should be prepared for surprises," said David
Kay, a former U.N. weapons inspector who is leading the CIA's weapons
investigation. "I think it's very likely that we will discover remarkable
surprises in this enterprise."
And if that's not enough for you:
Now I remember why I care more about the nous than the news.

The 6th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI
'04) will take place December 6-8, 2004 at the Renaissance Parc 55 Hotel
in San Francisco, California, and we would like to encourage your
OSDI 2004 will bring together professionals from academic and industrial
backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the
design, implementation, and implications of systems software.
Paper submissions are due on May 14, 2004. This is a hard deadline -- no
extensions will be given. Submission guidelines are available on our Web
site: Emphasizing both innovative research and quantified experience, OSDI
takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from
all fields of systems practice including, but not limited to: operating
systems, networking, file and storage systems, distributed systems,
mobile systems, secure systems, embedded systems, and the interaction of
hardware and software development. We particularly encourage
contributions containing highly original ideas or groundbreaking results
that push the frontier of systems research.
The symposium will consist of 2.5 days of single-track technical
sessions with presentations of refereed papers and a keynote address.  A
session of Work-in-Progress presentations is planned, and informal
Birds-of-a-Feather sessions may be organized by attendees.
We look forward to receiving your submissions.

For this to be taken seriously one must be able to -define spam- as if it
were a mathematical entity (eg a 'point'). It must be absolutely
differentiable from -all- other speech.
You can't do that, nobody can.
Anti-spam bills are worse than spam because they put transient feelings of
anger above the principles of freedom.

Read Zamyatin's "We".
Actually it's a perfect comparison. Anyone can put stuff on your front
porch. They can't take it away or read it, that is using personal property
without permission. Hence, people have a -right- to send you mail. They
don't have a right to read your mail without permission.
Sorry, your front porch isn't considerd 'trespassable' unless -you- take
explicit and particular steps.
Then you must put up a sign, does your mailbox have such a sign?
In fact your position backs up mine that the current trespass and
harassment laws are sufficient to handle this problem.
In other words, you shot yourself in your own foot with regard to 'new'
law. We don't need it. What we need is the courts to recognize that if we
tell somebody to stay away and they don't then an actionable event has
taken place.
So, we actually agree but you don't see it, yet.

:) There is an old saying that one becomes what one hates.
Personaly, I'm opposed to any legislative responce. Nada, none, nil.
I don't agree that whatever the cost at the personal level it will be less
than the increase in taxes to pay for the additional officers, legal
support staff, etc. In particular I don't like the aspect of making it a
crime. There is no way you're going to convince me that irrespective of
the level, it's worth sending black clad stormtroopers into peoples lives.
Especially when that includes the potentail for people dying.
No, sorry. Ain't gonna happen.
It violates both speech and press aspects of the first. And to be clear
'press' in the Constitution isn't the news agencies. Thomas Jefferson made
that perfectly clear. It's the right of people to share their activities
with others.
People have a right to speak their mind, and they have a right to share it
with others. To base that right on content is an abrogation of the
fundamental ethos of this nation.
There is of course the concepts of harassment and trespass. Of which we
have sufficient laws on the book already. What we do need is a good case
and a couple of supporting court rulings. In particular people have a
right to ring your doorbell or drop a note on their porch, or ring their
doorbell to talk to the residents. When they do it in a confrontational
manner, by say ringing your doorbell over and over.
This of course is one reason I am completely opposed to blacklists as
well. Not only is there no technical or legal backing with respect to
speech, but their probing of my system after I tell them to stay away is a
form of trespass. Let's not even get into the aspect that this is one of
the primary channels of Open Relay machines around. They do all the work
and then sell the list, to who? Your ISP and spammers. If they didn't
exist each spammer would have to scan the net for relays IP by IP. But no,
for some reason people think it's a good idea.
People have the right to the pursuit of happines, not the attainment or
retention of it. It's simply not the governments job to protect what you
have from simple market alteration. Stability in that respect is a bad
thing. It denies others pursuit of happiness with the goal of the

That is correct, YOU are responsible for it. And even that is a perfect
defence since there is still a public access to your property where it
meets public property, an easment (ie the place where a sidewalk goes). In
most cities it ranges from 3 to 4 ft. from the curb. That property is managed
under imminent domain concepts even though you are responsible for its
upkeep and such.

New book coming out about the Kennedy Assassination attempts to "present
compelling evidence that President Kennedy was killed Nov. 22, 1963, as
the result of a massive conspiracy between the CIA-installed government of
South Vietnam, the French global heroin syndicate and the New Orleans
Mafia."  It apparently presents quite a bit of new information.

Hey kids,
TechTV (Austin Digital Cable 239) is hosting a 2.5 hour special tonight
at 7:00 on file sharing issues, RIAA legal activities, etc.  They are
replaying it tomorrow night at 5:00PM and again Monday at 12:00P and
5:00PM.  I'll be taping it and will figure out the "right way" to share.
Via TechTV.com (techtv.com/musicwars):
Musicians, industry experts, and file traders break down the complicated
issues surrounding digital music. Watch today at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 6
p.m., and Monday 9/15 at 1 p.m. Eastern. By Steve Enders
Admit it: You're freaked out.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is suing music
downloaders as young as 12 years old. The organization has already
busted college students for downloading. Subpoenas have been served
seeking information on grandparents, mothers, and fathers. No one is
safe, and many don't even know they've done anything wrong.
Friday, TechTV brings you "Music Wars," a special that gets you up to
speed on how we arrived at this point -- and where digital music is
headed. Don't miss this exclusive look at the state of music as only
TechTV can explain it. "Music Wars" also sets the stage for "Music Wars:
Open Mike," TechTV's live, town hall forum featuring industry
executives, legal experts, and artists. If you're a music fan, or if
you're just interested in the groundbreaking legal issues surrounding
the download debate, this is a night of television you won't want to
You'll meet the ultimate music fans, people who have shaped their lives
around the prevalence of digital music. You'll meet artists including
Liz Phair, Michelle Branch, and others who have put everything at stake
by making their music so readily available online. You'll be surprised
by their varying opinions and openness with TechTV. We'll take you
behind the scenes of the major legal music services available online,
the services trying to fill the vacuum left by the glut of P2P software,
and the trade of illegal, copyright music.
Finally, you'll meet the queen of KaZaA, Nikki Hemming. "Tech Live"
reporter Jim Goldman sat down with Hemming in her Australian
headquarters to discuss the ramifications of what she's helped create,
and the industry she's helped inflame.
Featured 'Music Wars' Segments
Celebrities Sing, Squawk, Swap
on file-swapping, and others just sound good. Check out our recent
interviews and in-studio performances.
Peer-to-Peer Explained
Amazing what some computer code can do. It's the software that nearly
brought the music industry to its knees. It's also the software that has
prompted the industry to come back fighting -- gloves off -- and file
hundreds of lawsuits. The software known as Napster, written by a 17
year old, has evolved since 1999. See where it's been and where it's
going, and find out why the music industry would like to see it stopped.
Download 101
Incoming students normally start college with a tour around campus. At
the University of California, Berkeley, incoming freshmen are getting a
lesson in downloading music from P2P networks. The message: Do it at
your own risk. We visit orientation to see what the program is all
The Artists Speak
Liz Phair, Michelle Branch, Charlie Daniels, The Samples. They're
musicians with a diverse range of sounds, styles, and songs. They're
loved by millions around the world. They've also seen millions of their
songs downloaded from the Internet. But their opinions on file sharing
are as different as their music.
The Legal Alternative
When the RIAA began filing lawsuits against song swappers this week, it
also encouraged music fans to get their music the legal way using
services provided by Apple, BuyMusic.com, and Rhapsody. The services
offer thousands of good-quality songs, but are they the solution music
fans really want?

It seems that the veritable US Patent and Trademark Office, promulgator of
such wonderful ideas as sweeping patents on basic software algorithms,
seems to have revealed more of its true colors in recent statements.
In defending U.S. opposition to a recent World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) meeting on "open collaborative models to develop
public goods" and after significant Microsoft lobbying, Lois Boland,
director of international relations for the USPTO is quoted as saying:
"open-source software runs counter to the mission of WIPO which is to
promote intellectual-property rights...To hold a meeting which has as its
purpose to disclaim or waive such rights seems to us to be contrary to
the goals of WIPO."
Lessig is furious:
"The Quiet War Over Open-Source"
linked from The meeting has been quashed.  But the idear seems quite rooted.

very carefull to explain that IP spoofing was easy to do so that the

Revised Patriot Act Will Make It Illegal To Read Patriot Act
WASHINGTON, DC-President Bush spoke out Monday in support of a revised version of the 2001 USA Patriot Act that would make it illegal to read the USA Patriot Act. "Under current federal law, there are unreasonable obstacles to investigating and prosecuting acts of terrorism, including the public's access to information about how the federal police will investigate and prosecute acts of terrorism," Bush said at a press conference Monday. "For the sake of the American people, I call on Congress to pass this important law prohibiting access to itself." Bush also proposed extending the rights of states to impose the death penalty "in the wake of Sept. 11 and stuff."

@_subject: NOWAR - Leader of India's largest movement to speak (fwd) 
Hello, all. We have just received news of a unique opportunity to hear
an important speaker.
Medha Patkar, one of the most respected political activists in the
world, will be speaking in Austin the evening of Nov. 4 (specifics
below). This is a rare chance to hear directly from someone on the
cutting edge of resistance to the reckless uses of state and private
power that threaten so many lives and livelihoods.
Patkar founded and leads the Naramda Bachao Andolan (Save the Narmada
Movement), the largest nonviolent people's movement in India. Over the
course of two decades -- through relentless organizing, demonstrations,
and hunger strikes -- the movement has been the voice of hundreds of
thousands of indigenous peoples and peasants who are losing their land
and way of life to large dams on the Narmada River. Like so many large
centralized development projects, the benefits of these dams go to a
small elite and the costs are borne by ordinary people.
The movement has won policy changes in World Bank and other
multilateral funding agencies but continues to face hostility from the
Indian government and often violent police responses -- and continues
to resist through nonviolent civil disobedience. With significant
leadership and participation from women, the nonviolent satyagraha
(insistence on truth) has refused to back down.
Visit  to learn more about the struggle.
Patkar also spearheads the National Alliance of People's Movements, a
powerful network of more than 150 mass-based movements across India.
NAPM is a non-electoral, secular political alliance of peasant, tribal,
dalit, women and labor groups that are critical of corporate
globalization and offer alternative development plans.
Patkar's work has been recognized through countless international
awards, including the Right to Livelihood Award (known as the
alternative Nobel Prize), Goldman Environmental Prize, a Human Rights
Defender's Award from Amnesty International, the Magsaysay Award, and
Global Villager Award.
Patkar's lecture, "Who pays for progress?", will focus on policies that
inhibit sustainable development and people's non-violent struggles for
social justice.
The talk will be Tuesday, Nov. 4, at 7:30 p.m. in the LBJ Auditorium in
Sid Richardson Hall (the one-story building directly east of the LBJ
Library and Museum) on the University of Texas campus. Free parking is
available in the lots on Red River just south of Dean Keeton (26th St.)
Map available at Because the event happens in just over a week, it's important to spread
the word widely so as many people as possible can hear Patkar. Please
forward this information to any relevant email lists and web sites.
Flyers can be downloaded from The primary sponsor of the event is the Austin chapter of the
Association for India's Development, a nonprofit organization promoting
grassroots efforts for health care, education, small enterprise,
alternate energy, environmental action and people's rights in India.

Hi folks,
As some of you may have heard, we were moving very fast on having a
Cyberdawg next week.
I spoke with JonL this morning and we decided to postpone the cyberdawg
this month.
We had picked the 21st as a good date because it coincided with a panel
that the LBJ school was trying to pull together on eVoting.
Unfortunately, the panel fell through.
I decided that it would be useful to have an extra week or two to get a
lot of the ducks in a row (ex. T-shirts) before having our event rather
than trying to rush it.
Next week's major event, then, will be the Wireless party on Thursday(?)
for which EFF-A is a sponsor.  It'll be useful for us to get the word
out about this event. (details coming)
Furthermore, I'll work again with Ruta Maya to nail down a different
date (hopefully this won't be a big deal) and prepare fliers to pass
around at the Wireless event.
Thanks and sorry for the rampant misinformation,
David Nunez

@_subject: Q: Has a change taken place in factoring RSA keys? 
One of the local Linux user groups had a talk at their meeting as well as
some extended discussion on the mailing list regarding RSA keys and
In particular a claim was made that recent technology has come to light that
allows factoring of 1024 bit RSA keys at $1B (US)/day. The basic gist was that
they were claiming that 1024 keys were no longer reasonable outside of a life
time of approx. a year. That 2048 keys were by extension weaker, and that
larger keys should be the norm. There was some discussion about hacking GPG to
generate 8k keys.
I'm wondering if anyone might comment on this with regard to sources of info
or other efforts? In particular I'm interested in any leads regarding this
supposed hardware breakthrough.
I spent about an hour googling around and didn't really come up with
anything substantial.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 662 November 18, 2003   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein, and
James Riordon
A LIQUID WALL IN A FUSION ENERGY DEVICE has improved the performance
[SSZ: text deleted]
ELECTRON SPINS CAN CONTROL NUCLEAR SPINS in a semiconductor when
trapped in a very confined space, a recent experimental development
which calls upon laser science, solid-state physics, and nuclear
magnetic resonance.  David Awschalom and his colleagues at the Center for
Spintronics and Quantum Computation at UC Santa Barbara begin by
lithographically creating a quantum well, an extremely thin,
practically two-dimensional region inside a semiconductor
capable of trapping electrons. First, a laser pulse injects
polarized electrons (their spins have a definite orientation
determined by the laser's polarization) into the well.  Once in the
well, the tiny disk of electrons (with a radius of about 20 microns
but a thickness of only 20 nm) can be controllably moved along one
axis, much as an abacus bead can be slid along a wire, by simply
changing a voltage.  In this case, the disk can be positioned with
nm-accuracy.  The nuclei of atoms residing within the thin
volume occupied by the spin-polarized
electrons will in turn be polarized; that is, the spin of these
nuclei will tend to align themselves with the spin of the
electrons.  The result is an extremely thin region---equivalent to
the thickness of several tens of atoms--- of polarized nuclei
which can be precisely positioned by changing a single voltage.
These thin sheets of nuclear polarization could constitute the basic
elements of an information storage device in which nuclear spin
determines the logical state of the system.  One may ask, why not
take out the "middle man" and just use the electron spin to encode
information?  The answer: nuclear spins have a weaker interaction
with the surrounding environment than electron spins.  While harder
to flip, once oriented, nuclear spins preserve their state longer
than do electrons.  One may also wonder, why not just use some large
magnet to orient the nuclear spins?  Why use electrons as
intermediaries?  The answer: all-electronic control of spin is
desirable because electric fields are so much easier to control and
create on a small scale than magnetic fields.  They are scalable and
easy to implement, while it is notoriously hard to produce large and
localized magnetic fields.  In addition, all of our current
integrated circuit technology is based on charge and electric field;
it would certainly be helpful to manipulate spin using "knobs" which
are well developed and familiar to engineers.  Awschalom
(awsch 805-893-2121) believes this current result
is the first step toward the establishment of an all-electrical
manipulation of countable numbers of nuclear spins.(Poggio et al.,

[I still miss ole Leon Trotsky and his gang]
EFF supporters have a unique opportunity to hear and be heard at the Sixth
Annual Community Technology Networking Conference at the Holiday Inn (I-35
at Woodward this Monday and Tuesday.  Public interest technology is facing
near-crisis: we're out of fashion with government and corporate leaders,
telecom providers are avoiding underserved people, challenges like spam
and threats to free speech are back on the rise.  2004 will be a critical
But there are good prospects as well.  Community Information
Communications Technology (ICT) is one of the few telecom professions
solidly growing, and the major players are coming to Austin to meet with
us in a few days. (FCC, Department of Commerce, Gates Foundation and many
more) You need to be here.
EFF should be solidly represented, sharing views and plans for the future
of the Internet as something more than a mass marketing sales outlet. Cost
for the conference is no barrier either:  register as student is only $50,
includes three meals, and we don't check student IDs :) (regular is $100)
So come join us; we finally have a chance to make our concerns known!

EFF-Austin ( proudly brings you the CyberDawg
2003 World Tour*** December 16th at Opal Divines in Austin, TX.
6:00-8:00 - eVoting Roundtable:
Join Dan Wallach, Computer science professor and security expert from
Rice University, for dinner and discussion on eVoting for the December
edition of the EFF-Austin Policy Roundtable.
Dan Wallach is a member of the team, organized by Avi Rubin of Johns
Hopkins, which conducted a scathing analysis of the Diebold voting
system earlier this year.
Dan will discuss the "threat model" for electronic voting. What can go
wrong with evoting systems, what was wrong with the market-leading
Diebold system, and what can geek activists do about it?
8:00-close - CyberDawg:
What happens when you bring together smart, creative, and passionate
minds together to do nothing but talk, laugh, and instigate? We're not
sure. We think it'll be an earth-shattering event, though... The
Singularity, even.
What is EFF-Austin? Who's working behind the scenes? What is it up to
these days? What madcap adventures are planned for 2004? Calendar of
events? How can YOU get involved in the fray? These questions and more
will be answered at the Cyberdawg.
If nothing else, you'll be in the same room with movers, shakers, and
instigators in the Austin Tech/Art/and Cyberliberties scene... That's
gotta be worth something, right?
*** CyberDawg 2003 will not actually go on a world tour. Just Austin...
For that matter, there probably won't be too many thrills, chills, and
spills or the gnashing of metal or screaming fans, either. But it will
be fun, nonetheless.
