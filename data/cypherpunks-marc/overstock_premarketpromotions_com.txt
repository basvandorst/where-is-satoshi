Sunglass Manufacturers
          produce millions of dollars in excess inventory each year. Overstock
          Sunglasses has built a relationship with select,
        leading manufacturers, and retailers to move this inventory and make
        room for new merchandise. *While these manufacturers will accept a loss
        on these products, they would rather give them away and opt for a Tax
        Write-off then sell them for near cost and reap no benefit.
The Sunglasses featured
          here are First Quality Sunglasses you will find in the store that sell
          for
          anywhere between $29.95 & $79.95 and compare
        to designers like Armani, Maui, RayBan, and Killer Loops!
The only catch is that most of our products come in limited quantities
        - so if you see something you like, choose it now, because when they're
        gone, they're gone!
