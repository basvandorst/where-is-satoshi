@_subject: combat your fears 
My name is Kimberly and I was asked by Ziegler to talk to you about the benefits of the product that I am using.
I have been married for over 12 years now and lately, like all marriage's, we have become
more and more distant from each other.  We have not been intimate in over 6 months.  Well
about a month ago, I came across an email that was selling these products that was
guaranteed to help with our problem.  I was hesistant at first, but decided to go ahead
and try it anyway.  To my surprise, it worked exactly as they said. It's not the miracle that will save a marriage but it will definatlely help put the spark
back into the relationship. I am trying to help as many people as I can to find the happiness that once was. You should definately check it out and tell me what you think.
Just get back to me and tell me if I was able to help you with this.
