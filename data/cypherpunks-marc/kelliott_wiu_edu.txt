_without the consent of congress_
Hint- the state's have congresses consent.

Hey don't forget you can still buy a smart card reader from that most
cypherpunkish of babes BRITNEY SPEARS ! Only $30 !

I have found that the administrative costs of PKI are
intolerable. End users do not really understand crypto, and so
will fuck up. Only engineers can really control a PKI
certificate, and for the most part they just do not.
In principle the thingness of a smartcard should reduce
administrative costs to a low level -- they should supposedly
act like a purse, a key, a credit card, hence near zero user
training required.  The simulated thingness created by
cryptographic cleverness should be manifested to the user as
physical thingness of the card.
Suppose, for example, we had working Chaumian digicash.  Now
imagine how much trouble the average end user is going to get
into with backups, and with moving digicash from one computer
to another.  If all unused Chaumian tokens live in a smartcard,
one might expect the problem to vanish.  The purselike
character of the card sustains the coin like character of
Chaumian tokens.
Of course if one has to supply the correct driver for the smart
card, then the administration problem reappears.
USB smartcard interfaces could solve this problem.   Just plug
them in, and bingo, it should just go.  Ummh, wait a moment, go
where, do what?  What happens when one plugs in a USB smartcard
Still, making crypto embodied in smart cards intelligible to
the masses would seem to be a soluble problem, even if not yet
solved, whereas software only crypto is always going to boggle
the masses.

Indeed.  And the suggestion that a  be added to the standard to help prop up compilers that don't support the standard is a little... circular.

No.  Obviously the coupon was closely linked with my buying pattern, and in at least one case I received one of these "buy several" coupons without having purchased that product that particular trip (though I'd purchased it the the past).
My oh my.  Getting an early start on your new years resolution?

Yes/no.  When your not logged in your home folder is stored as an encrypted DiskImage.  In addition part of enabling FileVault was a complete rework of how login authentication was handled, part of which included removing the 8 char limitation.  For the record, apple has always allowed passwords longer than 8 char, prior to 10.3, however, only the first 8 char were used to log you in, though the other characters were used to unlock your keychain.
No they are not.  Apple considers DiskImages to be a proprietary competitive advantage.
It is a virtual certainty that Apple used Security.framework which includes a variety of algorithms (including AES) and secure/peer reviewed operation modes.  I believe the security framework is open source, and in fact based on a broader standard (CDSA).  If you'd like to know for certain I'd suggest you email dts and/or file a bug report at bugreporter.apple.com (requires free registration) on the documentation.
