Great post by your friend Razor, very enthusiast, made me remember the  nice impression I got when I first heard about it. Besides I didn't  know about that blog. Thank you very much for sharing.
Quoting Mirimir <mirimir 05/10/2016 03:53 PM, mrnobody  I checked the repo, I saw  there hasn't been a commit for a year or so. I
wanted to know your personal opinion on the project. I'd personally have
a look at the code but I know nothing of go.

First of all I'd like to say hello, since it's the first time I write  in this mailing list. Now to the matter at hand.
Do you remember the project Pond?
I actually never used it, but when back in the day I read the design  it seemed like a new approach to mail, encrypted and careful with  metadata. Now the project sees unmaintained, and it seems Adam Langley  deleted the webpage of the project (pond.imperialviolet.org) from its  personal webpage (imperialviolet.org)
An old post about the project for those who doesn't know it.

Speak for yourself on facebook if you please, I'm no user of it, so you
can save yourself the speech.
I wasn't saying that the documentary was good, I was giving a reference
on how some people are microchiping themselves voluntarily without
government coercion. No judgement, put as many chips as you want.
