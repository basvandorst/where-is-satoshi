@_subject: Putting the "NSA Data Overwrite Standard" Legend to Death... 
OK, I'm sure this one will start a flame war, but...I work for a vendor whose products overwrite files when "deleting" them as a way of protecting old data.  Lately several customers have been asking for "NSA" or "DoD" standard overwrites, usually with a value of 3, 7 or 9.  (Our response to the feature was to more or less let the owner of the product pick the number of overwrites; the obvious tradeoff is morewrites=slowerdisk.)
Anyway, while researching how we wanted to document recommended values for the overwrite feature, I looked into the "DoD" and "NSA" standards.
I was not surprised to see that a "DoD standard" DOES exist:
   Government name: DoD 5220.22-M
   A nice summary:  (not my product)
   Some original documents:    Long story short: 1 overwrite = CLEAR, 3 overwrites = SANITIZED (non-removable rigid disk)
I was surprised, however, to learn that a "NSA standard" DOES NOT exist.
I did the usual Google searches and came up with nothing but various sites and postings claiming the standard was anything from 5 to 20 overwrites.  Then I called the NSA (1-800-688-6115 -    The first person I chatted with passed on the question, but the second answered the question in no uncertain terms - NSA is aware of DoD 5220.22-M and DOES NOT have a separate recommendation.
So...could this finally be the end of IT employees casually tossing around the "NSA overwrite standard" - or is there something I'm missing?
Second, where did the number 7 really come from?  (It seems to be the leading recommendation out there right now for number of overwrites and is frequently attributed to the NSA.)
