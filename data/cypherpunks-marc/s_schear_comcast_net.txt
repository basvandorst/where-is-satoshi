Internet telephone calls are fast becoming a national security threat that must be countered with new police wiretap rules, according to an FBI proposal presented quietly to regulators this month.
Representatives of the FBI's Electronic Surveillance Technology Section in Chantilly, Va., have met at least twice in the past three weeks with senior officials of the Federal Communications Commission to lobby for proposed new Internet eavesdropping rules. The FBI-drafted plan seeks to force broadband providers to provide more efficient, standardized surveillance facilities and could substantially change the way that cable modem and DSL (digital subscriber line) companies operate.
The new rules are necessary, because terrorists could otherwise frustrate legitimate wiretaps by placing phone calls over the Internet, warns a summary of a July 10 meeting with the FCC that the FBI prepared. "Broadband networks may ultimately replace narrowband networks," the summary says. "This trend offers increasing opportunities for terrorists, spies and criminals to evade lawful electronic surveillance."

I'm sure once a useable, open source, non-blinded client is available there will be parties available to add the 50 lines or so of blinding code.  Alternatively, since the blinding patent is not recognized in many well-connected Net countries the code could legally be released from one of them, so that the user selects blinding based on jurisdiction and interest.

Probabilistic Analysis of Anonymity

Abstract: We present a formal analysis technique for probabilistic security properties of peer-to-peer communication systems based on random message routing among members. The behavior of group members and the adversary is modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain, and security properties are expressed as PCTL formulas. To illustrate feasibility of the approach, we model the Crowds system for anonymous Web browsing, and use a probabilistic model checker, PRISM, to perform automated analysis of the system...

The ideal securities market is one which does a good job of allocating capital in the economy. This function is enabled by "market efficiency", the situation where the market price of each security accurately reflects the risk and return in its future. The primary function of regulation and policy is to foster market efficiency, hence we must evaluate the impact of insider trading upon market efficiency.
Insider trading is often equated with market manipulation, yet the two phenomena are completely different. Manipulation is intrinsically about making market prices move away from their fair values; manipulators reduce market efficiency. Insider trading brings prices closer to their fair values; insiders enhance market efficiency.
In traditional markets, insider trading appears unfair, especially to speculators outside a company who face difficult competition in the form of inside traders. Individual speculators and fund managers alike face inferior returns when markets are more efficient owing to the actions of inside traders. This does not, in itself, imply that insider trading is harmful. Insider trading clearly hurts individual and institutional speculators, but the interests of the economy and the interests of these professional traders are not congruent. Indeed, inside traders competing with professional traders is not unlike foreign goods competing on the domestic market -- the economy at large benefits even though one class of economic agents suffers.

I was intensely opposed to the gibberish about how the Republicans "stole" the Florida vote, for multiple reasons. First, the Dems wanted to change the rules after the outcome went against them...they wanted "hanging chads" counted in their favor (ultimately, of course, this wouldn't have even swayed the outcome, as careful studies by newspapers showed). Second, they wanted the Elections Commission to somehow adjust the outcome based on exit interviews with little old Jewish ladies who claimed they wanted to vote for Algore but who actually voted for Pat Buchanan or Jeffery Dahmer or whomever it was that was opposite Chad Gore on the ballot (note that Democrats designed the ballot). Third, they wanted only precincts known to be leaning toward Chad Gore recounted from scratch. (I would have _opposed_ a statewide recount on general common sense and legal grounds, too, but for sure I was aghast at the proposal to only recount selected precincts: "We'll keep recounting until the outcome fluctuates in our favor!")
This was certainly a farce, but the decision by the SC to intervene was worse.  The matter should have been thrown into the House of Representative where the Constitution has provisions for its resolution (or lack thereof).

If an inquiry comes in when no relevant court orders are in place then the service can reply no.  If court order is received the service cannot tell the users, but it can fail to respond.  This response failure is documented in the feature service guide as being indicative of a muzzled service provider.  So, unless the courts can order a service provider to lie to their clients, and thus subject them to possible litigation if it violates their TOS, the this non-response should do the trick.

Everyone knows that money is the life blood of politics.  The topic of campaign finance reform in the U.S. has been on and off the front burner of the major media, for decades.  Although the ability of citizens and corporations to support the candidates and parties of their choice can be a positive political force, the ability of political contributors to buy access and influence legislation is probably the major source of governmental corruption.  Despite some, apparently, honest efforts at limiting these legal payoffs there has been little real progress.  The challenge is to encourage "neutral" campaign contributions.  Perhaps technology could lend a hand.
One of the features of Chaimian digital cash is unlinkability.  Normally, this has been viewed from the perspective of the payer and payee not wishing to be linked to a transaction.  But it also follows that that the payee can be prevented from learning the identity of the payee even if they wished.  Since the final payee in politics is either the candidate or the party, this lack of knowledge could make it much more difficult for the money to be involved in influence peddling and quid pro quo back room deals.
By combining a mandated digital cash system for contributions, a cap on the size of each individual contribution (perhaps as small as $100), randomized delays (perhaps up to a few weeks) in the "posting" of each transaction to the account of the counter party, it could create mix conditions which would thwart the ability of contributors to easily convince candidates and parties that they were the source of particular funds and therefore entitled to special treatment.

@_subject: hackers have broken into GPRS billing 
Some time today (October 2th), the GPRS world will reveal that it has a security vulnerability which has seen an undisclosed number of its customers ripped off. They've been trapped into connecting to malicious content servers, by hackers penetrating the billing system. The first international phone company to admit that they have installed a solution - one offered by Check Point - will be the German phone provider, E-Plus.
The scam is called "the over-billing attack." It works quite simply because of a link from the Internet world - unregulated - to the normally tightly regulated GSM planet. "Network administrators face an exponential onslaught of attacks that to date have traditionally been confined to the world of wire line data," was the summary from Check Point.
There are lots of potential issues, but the one which has forced the phone networks to acknowledge that there is a problem, is a scam where a company obtains IP addresses that the GPRS operators own, in the "cellular pool" and start pinging those addresses. When one of them responds, the scam operator knows that a user has been assigned the address. And, unbelievably, there was nothing to stop them simply providing services direct to that IP address - and taking the money out of the GPRS billing system to pay for it. The network, typically, only found out about the attack weeks later, when the angry customer queried the service provided, and insisted that they had not signed up for it.
Getting the IP address list costs the crook no more than it takes to log onto the GPRS network with a data call, and getting assigned an address by a perfectly standard DHCP server inside the operator's network.
Check Point hasn't revealed specifics of how it blocks this attack, but the solution is based on its Firewall-1 software, which is already installed in most cellular networks. "The problem could be fixed by changing the hardware," said a spokesman for Check Point. "But that would take a year to implement, and would require hardware changes in virtually every network operator's equipment. The alternative is to use the knowledge in the GPRS firewall to implement an action in the IP firewall."
The solution does require the operator to run Firewall-1 on its Internet equipment as well as its GPRS servers. Once that is in place, Checkpoint has a single mnagement architecture for all its firewalls. "Our preferred solution is to write a rule that says: 'I have now closed this session on my GPRS side, so tell the IP firewall to look for any IP sessions with this IP address, and close them'," said a Check Point executive. Check Point expects several other announcements from phone network operators in the coming weeks.
The problem isn't limited to GPRS. Any mobile network that is internally trusted - and that includes next-level technology like UMTS 3G networks - will face similar threats when linking its internal, trusting network to the free-for-all that is the Internet, and will have to adopt similar solutions, says Check Point. "The vulnerability also applies between data networks. The GPRS Transfer Protocol, GTP, provides no security to protect the communications between GPRS networks," says the company in its sales blurbs. "So the GPRS/UMTS network is at risk, both from its own subscribers, and from its partner networks." Details from Check Point itself

Monkeys Control Robotic Arm With Brain Implants
By Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 13, 2003; Page A01
Scientists in North Carolina have built a brain implant that lets monkeys control a robotic arm with their thoughts, marking the first time that mental intentions have been harnessed to move a mechanical object.
The technology could someday allow people with paralyzing spinal cord injuries to operate machines or tools with their thoughts as naturally as others today do with their hands. It might even allow some paralyzed people to move their own arms or legs again, by transmitting the brain's directions not to a machine but directly to the muscles in those latent limbs.
The brain implants could also allow scientists or soldiers to control, hands-free, small robots that could perform tasks in inhospitable environments or in war zones.
In the new experiments, monkeys with wires running from their brains to a robotic arm were able to use their thoughts to make the arm perform tasks. But before long, the scientists said, they will upgrade the implants so the monkeys can transmit their mental commands to machines wirelessly.
"It's a major advance," University of Washington neuroscientist Eberhard E. Fetz said of the monkey studies. "This bodes well for the success of brain-machine interfaces."
The experiments, led by Miguel A.L. Nicolelis of Duke University in Durham, N.C., and published today in the journal PLoS Biology, are the latest in a progression of increasingly science fiction-like studies in which animals

Your tongue-in-cheek mention about libraries being hot beds of piracy set me to thinking about the mechanics of sharing copyrighted content and whether there might be a technical solution which addresses the letter of the law in abiding copyright but allows consumers almost unfettered access to the music they have downloaded.
Not long ago I found that my county library had contracted with a service provider to enable patrons to download electronic versions of books, which they could read at their leisure during a certain time window (usually from a few days to a week).  After this time the 'reader' software would no longer allow access to the book even though it was stored on the user's local disc. In this way it created a virtual 'lending' environment wherein the number of readers of a particular title being read was always less than or equal to the number of licenses the service owned for each work.
Why couldn't this be applied on-line to music.  Under current fair use provisions readers and listeners who have purchased a work are allowed to lend it out freely.  Surely the number of people who want to read or listen to a work are much smaller at any particular moment than the number of people who have ripped/downloaded a work (perhaps only 1 in 100 at most).  If some mechanism could be made part of the P2P systems purchasers of the work could 'lend' it to others to read, view or hear when they are not using it.  As long as the system gave some assurance to Hollywood that the works were not being enjoyed at any one moment by more people than had paid for the works then the spirit of a lending library would be maintained.
I'm sure some will jump in and say that because I purchased the music on a CD, then I must lend the CD, but it is already (I believe) considered fair use for purchasers to rip their CDs and transfer them to a PC, etc.  If the purchaser was willing to destroy the CD then they would only have one copy on their disc (perhaps its and .mp3 now).  why couldn't they lend this copy?
Someone else must have thought up this idea, but I don't recall seeing it.  Please inform me nicely if you have seen it proposed before.

Those that operate a business and possess firearms, to protect the business, will now have to think whether the possession could get them substantial jail time if they are also found to be somehow in violation of some other criminal statute.  Imagine a liquor store in a violent neighborhood.that is occasionally selling to underage kids (counterfeit IDs are rampant).  Imagine a drug dealer trying to protect their inventory from competitor expropriation.
Some will forego having a firearm present and risk what protection it affords.  Others will have to consider an uninvited police visit as a personal threat and preemptively open fire.  This and 3-strikes laws are not good news for law enforcement.

F.B.I.'s Reach Into Records Is Set to Grow
By ERIC LICHTBLAU
ASHINGTON, Nov. 11 A little-noticed measure approved by both the House and Senate would significantly expand the F.B.I.'s power to demand financial records, without a judge's approval, from car dealers, travel agents, pawnbrokers and many other businesses, officials said on Tuesday.
Traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions are frequently subject to administrative subpoenas from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to produce financial records in terrorism and espionage investigations. Such subpoenas, which are known as national security letters, do not require the bureau to seek a judge's approval before issuing them.
The measure now awaiting final approval in Congress would significantly broaden the law to include securities dealers, currency exchanges, car dealers, travel agencies, post offices, casinos, pawnbrokers and any other institution doing cash transactions with "a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory matters."
Officials said the measure, which is tucked away in the intelligence community's authorization bill for 2004, gives agents greater flexibility and speed in seeking to trace the financial assets of people suspected of terrorism and espionage. It mirrors a proposal that President Bush outlined in a speech two months ago to expand the use of administrative subpoenas in terrorism cases.
Critics said the measure would give the federal government greater power to pry into people's private lives.
"This dramatically expands the government's authority to get private business records," said Timothy H. Edgar, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. "You buy a ring for your grandmother from a pawnbroker, and the record on that will now be considered a financial record that the government can get."
The provision is in the authorization bills passed by both houses of Congress. Some Democrats have begun to question whether the measure goes too far and have hinted that they may try to have it pulled when the bill comes before a House-Senate conference committee. Other officials predicted that the measure would probably survive any challenges in conference and be signed into law by President Bush, in part because the provisions already approved in the House and the Senate are identical.
The intelligence committees considered the proposal at the request of George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, officials said. Officials at the C.I.A. and the Justice Department declined to comment on Tuesday about the measure.
A senior Congressional official who supports the provision said that "this is meant to provide agents with the same amount of flexibility in terrorism investigations that they have in other types of investigations."
"This was really just a technical change to reflect the new breed of financial institutions," the official added.
Asked what had prompted the measure, the official said: "This is coming from 3,000 dead people. There's an ever-expanding universe of places where terrorists can hide financial transactions, and it's only prudent and wise to anticipate where they might be and to give law enforcement the tools that they need to find them."
Christopher Wray, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division, also addressed the issue last month at a Senate hearing.
Mr. Wray said that compared with the antiterrorism law that allowed agents to demand business records with court approval, the F.B.I.'s administrative subpoenas were more limited. The administrative subpoenas "do provide for production of some records," he said, but "they don't cover as many types of business records."

Case For War Confected, Say Top U.S. Officials
      By Andrew Gumbel
      Independent UK
      Sunday 09 November 2003
      An unprecedented array of US intelligence professionals, diplomats and
former Pentagon officials have gone on record to lambast the Bush
administration for its distortion of the case for war against Iraq. In their
view, the very foundations of intelligence-gathering have been damaged in
ways that could take years, even decades, to repair.
      A new documentary film beginning to circulate in the United States
features one powerful condemnation after another, from the sort of people
who usually stay discreetly in the shadows - a former director of the CIA,
two former assistant secretaries of defence, a former ambassador to Saudi
Arabia and even the man who served as President Bush's Secretary of the Army
until just a few months ago.
      Between them, the two dozen interviewees reveal how the pre-war
intelligence record on Iraq showed virtually the opposite of the picture the
administration painted to Congress, to US voters and to the world. They also
reconstruct the way senior White House officials - notably Vice-President
Dick Cheney - leaned on the CIA to find evidence that would fit a
preordained set of conclusions.
      "There was never a clear and present danger. There was never an
imminent threat. Iraq - and we have very good intelligence on this - was
never part of the picture of terrorism," says Mel Goodman, a veteran CIA
analyst who now teaches at the National War College.
      The case for accusing Saddam Hussein of concealing weapons of mass
destruction was, in the words of the veteran CIA operative Robert Baer,
largely achieved through "data mining" - going back over old information and
trying to wrest new conclusions from it. The agenda, according to George
Bush Senior's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Chas Freeman, was both highly
political and profoundly misguided.
      "The theory that you can bludgeon political grievances out of existence
doesn't have much of a track record," he says, "so essentially we have been
neo-conned into applying a school of thought about foreign affairs that has
failed everywhere it has been tried."
      The hour-long film - entitled Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq
War - was put together by Robert Greenwald, a veteran TV producer in the
forefront of Hollywood's anti-war movement who never suspected, when he
started out, that so many establishment figures would stand up and be
      "My attitude was, wow, CIA people, I thought these were the bad guys,"
Mr Greenwald said. "Not everyone agreed on everything. Not everyone was
against the war itself. But there was a universally shared opinion that we
had been misled about the reasons for the war."
      Although many elements in the film are not necessarily new - the forged
document on uranium sales from Niger to Iraq, the aluminium tubes falsely
assumed to be parts for nuclear weapons, the satellite images of "mobile
biolabs" that turned out to be hydrogen compression facilities, the
"decontamination vehicles" that were in fact fire engines - what emerges is
a striking sense of professional betrayal in the intelligence community.
      As the former CIA analyst Ray McGovern argues with particular force,
the traditional role of the CIA has been to act as a scrupulously accurate
source of information and analysis for presidents pondering grave
international decisions. That role, he said, had now been "prostituted" and
the CIA may never be the same. "Where is Bush going to turn to now? Where is
his reliable source of information now Iraq is spinning out of control? He's
frittered that away," Mr McGovern said. "And the profound indignity is that
he probably doesn't even realise it."
      The starting point for the tarnishing of the CIA was a speech by
Vice-President Cheney on 26 August 2002, in which he told the Veterans of
Foreign Wars in Nashville that Saddam was reconstituting his nuclear weapons
programme and was thus threatening to inflict "death on a massive scale - in
his own region or beyond".
      According to numerous sources, Mr Cheney followed up his speech with a
series of highly unorthodox visits to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia,
in which he badgered low-level analysts to come up with information to
substantiate the extremely alarming - but entirely bogus - contents of his
      By early September, intelligence experts in Congress were clamouring
for a so-called National Intelligence Estimate, a full rundown of everything
known about Iraq's weapons programmes. Usually NIEs take months to produce,
but George Tenet, the CIA director, came up with a 100-page document in just
three weeks.
      The man he picked to write it, the weapons expert Robert Walpole, had a
track record of going back over old intelligence assessments and reworking
them in accordance with the wishes of a specific political interest group.
In 1998, he had come up with an estimate of the missile capabilities of
various rogue states that managed to sound considerably more alarming than a
previous CIA estimate issued three years earlier. On that occasion, he was
acting at the behest of a congressional commission anxious to make the case
for a missile defence system; the commission chairman was none other than
Donald Rumsfeld, now Secretary of Defence and a key architect of the Iraq
      Mr Walpole's NIE on Iraq threw together all the elements that have now
been discredited - Niger, the alumin- ium tubes, and so on. It also gave the
misleading impression that intelligence analysts were in broad agreement
about the Iraqi threat, relegating most of the doubts and misgivings to
footnotes and appendices.
      By the time parts of the NIE were made public, even those few
qualifications were excised. When President Bush's speechwriters got to work
- starting with the address to Congress on 7 October that led to a
resolution authorising the use of force against Iraq - the language became
even stronger.
      Mr Tenet fact-checked the 7 October speech, and seems to have played a
major role in every subsequent policy address, including Colin Powell's
powerful presentation to the United Nations Security Council on 5 February.
Of that pivotal speech, Mr McGovern says in the film: "It was a masterful
performance, but none of it was true."

"[I]t is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."

So, how does a non-criminal citizen protect themselves against armed home invaders who break down their front door or crash through a window to gain entry?  Are citizens liable for injuries and deaths to law enforcement personnel who use such unannounced methods (esp. in the early morning hours)?
I know that there have been cases which determined that its illegal to use an indiscriminate weapon (e.g., a shotgun tied to a door) to deter such entries, but what about a discriminate, automated, weapon system?  By coupling night vision optics and a video pickup, image recognition software, a robotic gimbal and an semi-automatic firearm, such a system could discriminate forced entry situations from more normal entry means, target intruders and initiate deterrence. What then?

Debka: Conflict's Drudge Report?
By Noah Shachtman
Story location: 02:00 AM Oct. 05, 2001 PT
The Iraqis are training Osama bin Laden's troops in chemical and biological weapons; Russian commando units packing newly acquired American arms are poised to storm Afghanistan; Israel is about to be charged with damaging the mosques on Jerusalem's contested Temple Mount.
Stories like these- are making the free-wheeling Israeli news site Debkafile an increasingly popular destination for Americans looking for the inside scoop on the conflict with terrorism.
John Ghazivinian, an editor at news professionals' site Mediabistro, added, "There's a real strong sense that the mainstream media have scaled back their operations so much that they're basically incapable of covering this from the ground."
Debkafile -- based in the Jerusalem neighborhood of French Hill, equidistant from both Palestinian villages and the walls of the Old City -- has shown an ability to get that kind of coverage. USA Today, CNN and NBC all reported last Friday that American and British forces were in Afghanistan scouting out terrorist hiding places; Debkafile had the same story days earlier, and included details about Russian intelligence officers and German commandos joining in the incursions.
On the Saturday before, Debkafile ran a story that Saudi Arabia had refused to let the U.S. use its air bases to stage attacks on Afghanistan; it took The New York Times another two days to report this information.
Like the Drudge Report, which it resembles, Debkafile clearly reports with a point of view; the site is unabashedly in the hawkish camp of Israeli politics and has partnered with the far-right news site WorldNetDaily for a weekly, $120 subscription product.
"Not everything Debka says is going to be confirmed, but I guarantee you three days later you'll find at least one item in The New York Times," said Greg Clayman, a New York City Internet marketing executive. "When (White House press secretary) Ari Fleischer tells the mainstream media, 'Watch what you say,' you've got to look for other sources."

True, but if the masses understand what s at stake for them they will reject all such solutions where it counts: at the sales counter.  The following is from a posting by John Gilmore, early employee of Sun Microsystems, founder of the EFF and founding cypherpunk extraoridair.  I usually don't forward so much content from another list, in this case the cryptography list, but John's rants are usually quite coherent and incisive.  This one is no exception.
--begin forward
TCPA is being built specifically at the behest of Hollywood.  It is
built around protecting "content" from "subscribers" for the benefit
of a "service provider".  I know this because I read, and kept, all
the early public design documents, such as the white paper
   (This is no longer available from the web site, but I have a copy.)
It says, on page 7-8:
   The following usage scenarios briefly illustrate the benefits of TCPA
   compliance.
   Scenario I: Remote Attestation
   TCPA remote attestation allows an application (the "challenger") to
   trust a remote platform. This trust is built by obtaining integrity
   metrics for the remote platform, securely storing these metrics and
   then ensuring that the reporting of the metrics is secure.
   For example, before making content available to a subscriber, it is
   likely that a service provider will need to know that the remote
   platform is trustworthy. The service provider's platform (the
   "challenger") queries the remote platform. During system boot, the
   challenged platform creates a cryptographic hash of the system BIOS,
   using an algorithm to create a statistically unique identifier for the
   platform. The integrity metrics are then stored.
   When it receives the query from the challenger, the remote platform
   responds by digitally signing and then sending the integrity
   metrics. The digital signature prevents tampering and allows the
   challenger to verify the signature. If the signature is verified, the
   challenger can then determine whether the identity metrics are
   trustworthy. If so, the challenger, in this case the service provider,
   can then deliver the content. It is important to note that the TCPA
   process does not make judgments regarding the integrity metrics. It
   merely reports the metrics and lets the challenger make the final
   decision regarding the trustworthiness of the remote platform.
They eventually censored out all the sample application scenarios like
DRM'd online music, and ramped up the level of jargon significantly,
so that nobody reading it can tell what it's for any more.  Now all
the documents available at that site go on for pages and pages saying
things like "FIA_UAU.1 Timing of authentication. Hierarchical to: No
other components. FIA_UAU.1.1 The TSF shall allow access to data and
keys where entity owner has given the 'world' access based on the
value of TCPA_AUTH_DATA_USAGE; access to the following commands:
TPM_SelfTestFull, TPM_ContinueSelfTest, TPM_GetTestResult,
TPM_PcrRead, TPM_DirRead, and TPM_EvictKey on behalf of the user to be
performed before the user is authenticated."
But the historical record is clear that DRM was "Usage Scenario for TCPA.
Now, back to Hollywood.  If you have not read "This Business of Music"
(a thick book on how musicians can arm themselves with knowledge to
get slightly less screwed by the record industry -- including sample
contracts and explanations of the impact and history of each
provision), you won't know the long history of why Hollywood can be
trusted only to cheat everyone they deal with.
A music-industry contract equivalent to charging for 30% more seconds
than you deliver, is the provision for "breakage".  No artist gets
paid for more than 90% of the albums that the record company sells,
because in the days of shellac records, about 10% of them would break
in shipping.  That problem largely went away with vinyl records, and
went even further away with CDs.  Today's actual breakage is way under
1%.  But record companies won't sign a contract that pays the artist
for more than 90% of the albums shipped on CD.  That 10% underpayment
of musicians goes straight back to the record company's profits.
Their DRM software will cheat users the same way -- or a different
way -- or a hundred different ways.  And TCPA will make it un-auditable
by us.

I have no idea what led to believe this.  The North behaved so dishonorably
during the war that it essentially rewrote the book on the rules of war for
the rest of the world.  Most academic historians, without legal training,
have played down the war crimes issue, as if it has no bearing on those who
win a war. It does.
In the early seventeenth century, Hugo Grotius, a Dutch lawyer, came forth
with The Law of War and Peace, which was translated into English in 1646.
It immediately became the bible of the law of nations and found its way
into the courts, libraries, and governments of Europe. Grotius soon became
"the father of modern international law." Grotius held that states, like
people, are bound by a code of law, with duties and prohibitions that are
universal, reasonable, and unchangeable. One nation, for example, may not
attack another. After reviewing the practices of ancient nations,
philosophers and legists, Grotius concluded that "authorities generally
as-sign to wars three justifiable causes: defence, recovery of property,
and punishment."
Grotius noted that the German barbarians of the north had a strong code and
"were the most just: they refrained from war unless attacked." The Ro-man
lawyer Cicero would have been the father of ancient international law. In
his De Republica (30.23) he set forth the principle that "wars undertaken
without reason are unjust wars. Except for the purpose of avenging or
re-pulsing an enemy, no just war can be waged."
By the nineteenth century, the concept of a just war became a part of the
law of nations even though it had been an unwritten rule of society since
the Middle Ages. Many of the tax rebellions in Europe, Spain, and England
were resisting revenue demands of unjust wars, wars that were not for the
defense of the realms. That same principle became part of the U.S.
Constitution, which restricted tax expenditures for "the common Defense."
At West Point cadets were taught the principles of Grotius and
international law under General Order no. 12, by none other than Lincoln's
top commander, General Henry Halleck, who wrote the book. No general
dur-ing the Civil War can claim ignorance of the laws of wars, especially
the laws against the plunder and devastation of private property. Here is
an ex-cerpt from General Order no. 12, written by Halleck on the wanton
plun-der of private property: "The inevitable consequences . . . are
universal pil-lage and a total relaxation of discipline; the loss of
private property, and the violation of individual rights . . . and the
ordinary peaceful and non-combatants are converted into bitter and
implacable enemies. The system is, therefore, regarded as both impolitic
and unjust, and is coming into gen-eral disuse among the most civilized
But Halleck's book and teachings weren't the only condemnation of plunder
of civilian property. On 24 April 1863, under Lincoln's signature, the army
promulgated to its officers General Order no. 100, which came to be known
as the Lieber Code and eventually received acclaim throughout the military
in the Western world. Halleck was a close friend of its author, Professor
Francis Lieber of Columbia University. A month after this order was given
to the officers in the Union army, Professor Lieber wrote to the top
commander, General Halleck
"I know by letters . . . that the wanton destruction of property by our men
is alarming. It does incalculable injury. It demoralizes our troops, it
annihilates wealth irrevocably and makes a return to a state of peace and
peaceful minds more and more difficult. Your order [to the offi-cers] . . .
with reference to the Code, and pointing out the disastrous consequences of
reckless devastation, in a manner that it might not furnish our reckless
enemy with new arguments for his savagery."
Halleck remained general in chief until Lincoln fired him in 1864 and
appointed Grant as top commander. 1t was under Grant that the Lieber Code,
now in the hands of all leading officers, was disregarded, and pillage and
plunder became the general order of the final year of the war. Sherman and
Sheridan could not possibly have undertaken their devastation of the South
if they had followed this new military code on the laws of war. They also
turned away from their education at West Point and the laws of war they had
learned there under Halleck.
Years after the war Sherman wrote a letter to a friend in which he
acknowledged that he knew better that at West Point he had been taught that
the pillage he brought to the South was a crime, punishable by death: "1
know that in the beginning 1, too, had the old West Point notion that
pil-lage was a capital crime, and punished it by shooting."
American generals were frilly aware that Napoleon was punished and banished
from Europe for engaging in aggressive wars over a twenty year period. The
law of warfare was being enforced for the first tune against a loser. But
winners need not worry, then or now, as war crimes, by and large, are only
committed by defeated leaders. In the Civil War, Lincoln and his generals
were immune from the laws of war because they won.
Unfortunately, during the nineteenth century, Americans seemed to believe
that they had a divine right to aggression. It was the destiny of the
American people and government to rule over North America--all of it. And
this was God's plan. This made the war against Mexico justified, even
though in General Grant's memoirs he condemned the war as one of
ag-gression, and so did Lincoln as a congressman at the time. This may
explain why so much has been written about who fired the first shot of the
Civil War, as if that justifies the total war that engulfed America, even
though that Fourth of July display of cannon at Fort Sumter didn't hurt
any-one. It was not Pearl Harbor.
The laws of war not only focused on the aggressor defender issue, they also
set forth rules about how armies and especially its leaders and gen-erals
had to conduct themselves. Historians with a strongly Northern Lincoln
idolizing viewpoint do not realize the criminal element in the way the war
was conducted criminal by the laws of nations. The end clearly justified
the means. Consider this observation by a prominent historian, Stephen
Oates, who describes Lincoln's method of warfare in glowing terms:
"Lincoln's armies were mopping up the Confederacy in all direc-tions,
waging scorched earth warfare against the Rebel economy and civil-ian
morale with ruthless efficiency .... Lincoln fully endorsed Sheridan's
burning of the Shenandoah Valley, Sherman's brutal March to the Sea through
Georgia, and the Carolina's Brigadier General James H. Wilson's destructive
raid across Alabama. Such warfare earned Lincoln and his gen-erals undying
hatred in Dixie, but it brought victory."
In addition to abandoning the Constitution, the Lincoln administration
established another ominous precedent by deciding to abandon international
law and the accepted moral code of civilized societies and wage war on
civilians. General Sherman announced that to secessionists all of them,
women and children included--death is mercy.
Lincoln and his generals violated the laws of nations, and Northern
historians seem unaware of that. Another famous historian from Princeton,
James M. McPherson, goes even further than Oates. He doesn't hesitate to
call Lincoln's war strategy brilliant, even using the term "genius," and
Sherman, with Lincoln's adoration, is a great noble general for his
devastation of civilian property in his march to the sea. When a Southerner
called Sherman a barbarian for what he was doing, Sherman replied that a
commander "may take your house, your fields, your everything, and turn you
out helpless to starve. It may be wrong, but that don't alter the case."
His acknowledgment that "it may be wrong" may have come from his education
at West Point, and contrary to the famous general's excuse, it does alter
the case it makes Sherman a war criminal. Writing to General Halleck in
September 1864, amid his infamous destruction of civilian property and
life, Sherman again excused himself: "If people [civilians] raise a howl
against my barbarity and cruelty I will answer them that war is war." This
is the same general who later, in the Indian wars, used the same philosophy
when he said, "The only good Indian is a dead Indian," which he meant
literally. Incidentally, l am not the only historian to see the commission
of war crimes by Sherman and his confederates in arms. Otto Cisenschirnl,
writing in the January 1964 issue of Civil War Times, less than twenty
years after the Nuremberg war crimes trials, asserted that Sherman should
have been hanged as a war criminal.'
While the generals were quite pleased with themselves over their barbarism
and war crimes, the soldiers who had to carry out these orders were not so
pleased with the work. Robert Shaw, a student at Harvard who had risen
through the ranks to be promoted to colonel in early 1863, was commanded by
a superior officer to burn the city of Darien, Georgia. He wrote to his
wife that "for myself, I have gone through the war so far without dishonor,
and I do not like to degenerate into a plunderer and robber, and the same
applies to every officer in my regiment."  (This is the same Shaw portrayed
in the movie Glory.)
Too bad the top gun, General Sherman, didn't feel that way. Sherman lived,
but Shaw, this remarkable officer, was killed in action on Morris Is-land,
South Carolina, a month after writing the above letter.
Lincoln's policy of crushing dissenters with overwhelming military might
was continued after the war with the federal government's eradication of
the Plains Indians by many of the same generals who had guided the North's
war effort (particularly Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan). The stated purpose
of this campaign against the Plains Indians was to make way for the
government subsidized transcontinental railroads. The quest for empire had
become the primary goal of government in America.

True, but if the masses understand what s at stake for them they will reject all such solutions where it counts: at the sales counter.  The following is from a posting by John Gilmore, early employee of Sun Microsystems, founder of the EFF and founding cypherpunk extraoridair.  I usually don't forward so much content from another list, in this case the cryptography list, but John's rants are usually quite coherent and incisive.  This one is no exception.
--begin forward
TCPA is being built specifically at the behest of Hollywood.  It is
built around protecting "content" from "subscribers" for the benefit
of a "service provider".  I know this because I read, and kept, all
the early public design documents, such as the white paper
   (This is no longer available from the web site, but I have a copy.)
It says, on page 7-8:
   The following usage scenarios briefly illustrate the benefits of TCPA
   compliance.
   Scenario I: Remote Attestation
   TCPA remote attestation allows an application (the "challenger") to
   trust a remote platform. This trust is built by obtaining integrity
   metrics for the remote platform, securely storing these metrics and
   then ensuring that the reporting of the metrics is secure.
   For example, before making content available to a subscriber, it is
   likely that a service provider will need to know that the remote
   platform is trustworthy. The service provider's platform (the
   "challenger") queries the remote platform. During system boot, the
   challenged platform creates a cryptographic hash of the system BIOS,
   using an algorithm to create a statistically unique identifier for the
   platform. The integrity metrics are then stored.
   When it receives the query from the challenger, the remote platform
   responds by digitally signing and then sending the integrity
   metrics. The digital signature prevents tampering and allows the
   challenger to verify the signature. If the signature is verified, the
   challenger can then determine whether the identity metrics are
   trustworthy. If so, the challenger, in this case the service provider,
   can then deliver the content. It is important to note that the TCPA
   process does not make judgments regarding the integrity metrics. It
   merely reports the metrics and lets the challenger make the final
   decision regarding the trustworthiness of the remote platform.
They eventually censored out all the sample application scenarios like
DRM'd online music, and ramped up the level of jargon significantly,
so that nobody reading it can tell what it's for any more.  Now all
the documents available at that site go on for pages and pages saying
things like "FIA_UAU.1 Timing of authentication. Hierarchical to: No
other components. FIA_UAU.1.1 The TSF shall allow access to data and
keys where entity owner has given the 'world' access based on the
value of TCPA_AUTH_DATA_USAGE; access to the following commands:
TPM_SelfTestFull, TPM_ContinueSelfTest, TPM_GetTestResult,
TPM_PcrRead, TPM_DirRead, and TPM_EvictKey on behalf of the user to be
performed before the user is authenticated."
But the historical record is clear that DRM was "Usage Scenario for TCPA.
Now, back to Hollywood.  If you have not read "This Business of Music"
(a thick book on how musicians can arm themselves with knowledge to
get slightly less screwed by the record industry -- including sample
contracts and explanations of the impact and history of each
provision), you won't know the long history of why Hollywood can be
trusted only to cheat everyone they deal with.
A music-industry contract equivalent to charging for 30% more seconds
than you deliver, is the provision for "breakage".  No artist gets
paid for more than 90% of the albums that the record company sells,
because in the days of shellac records, about 10% of them would break
in shipping.  That problem largely went away with vinyl records, and
went even further away with CDs.  Today's actual breakage is way under
1%.  But record companies won't sign a contract that pays the artist
for more than 90% of the albums shipped on CD.  That 10% underpayment
of musicians goes straight back to the record company's profits.
Their DRM software will cheat users the same way -- or a different
way -- or a hundred different ways.  And TCPA will make it un-auditable
by us.

One interesting aspect of the current arms war being fought between consumers determined to ignore copyright, their technological helpers in the development community and the RIAA/MPAA is a possible resurgence of interest in non-file sharing P2P architectures.  By this I mean schemes where the information is distributed among sharing participants in a fashion where each holds only a portion of the desired file in a form not identifiable as such by individual users.
Freenet and MNet (previously Mojo Nation) both use such an approach.  They create an Internet RAID drive cluster across the storage participants have offered to the sharing system.  Individual users are not associated with offering individual files, they simply have offered storage for data the content of which they know not.  User downloads from such systems are, of course, organized as individually identifiable files, but these are separately stored and not exposed outside their PCs.  "NetRAID" P2P approaches have suffered from complexity and stability problems which greatly affected their popularity, but there is reason to believe that such shortcomings may soon be a thing of the past.

Because it means you can complete call to the POTs with no company-controlled switch involved, meaning no where to serve a court order.  Since the call could be routed through a few intermediate nodes and still not have too much latency traffic analysis could take longer than short calls.  Since the last gateway could be selected from a potentially large group, in major cities anyway, obtaining a phone tap in time could be come problematic.
Also, if long distance charges don't drop to zero soon, it means participating residential users could actually resell their POTS.

What I'd like to see is a P2P telephony that also supports end-user gateways to the POTS.  I'm not certain, but I think there are some MS certified modems which have a generalized A/D-D/A capability sufficient to handle voice.  Although it opens up the possibility of end-user eavesdropping some of this might be thwarted by randomizing user node selection and detecting/reporting line impedance changes (indicating an extension going off-hook) to the 'client' wising to use the POTS. I suggested this idea to Jeff Pulver, now a VoIP champion, in 1999 but he thought it was too out of the mainstream to be interesting.  Now that P2P is beginning to branch out from file sharing maybe this is no longer a far out idea.

From a 2001 cypherpunks post to cypherpunks
Fundamental questions have been raised regarding the legal and moral foundation of ad hoc judicial forums, such the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague and Rwandan tribunals.  Both were created by the U.N. Security Council though its charter mentions no such authority.  Isn't this little more than mob justice carried out by nation states?  Come to think of it isn't the purpose of all murder trials "civilized Vengeance" (small c, big V)?
The espoused purpose of these courts is to enforce "norms of justice in the international community."  But who constitutes that community and what are those norms?  The truth is justice like beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Historically, the notion of what is just has varied considerably and often based on economics and religion.  Modern western justice tends to ignore these factors and so sets the stage, indirectly, for a trial of cultures.  Even within the west these norms seem to be rapidly changing.  Can or should such norms be used a basis for international law?
Uniform Application
Like the Nuremberg trials before them, these tribunals appear ripe with application of ex post facto "laws" and inattention to technicalities.  They often bear little resemblance to the laws and their application within the major U.N. member states.  The states have no great interest in either bringing a consistent moral basis to their foreign and domestic policies or establishing strong extra-national courts which could conceivably bring national leaders to account their actions.
All potential violators must be investigated with equal vigilance and judged according to a uniform standard or none should be.  Serious charges have been leveled against Henry Kissenger yet no criminal indictments have been brought or even discussed by the tribunals.  Unless these courts are held by world citizens to the motto "Equal Justice Under Law" carved on our Supreme Court building then no courts should be convened.  Current procedures brand the courts as a propaganda puppet show merely using forms of justice to carry out a predetermined policy.
Despite frequent evidence that economics trump justice, national governments continue the charade of representing all the interests of their citizens.  Mohammed Douri, Iraq's U.N. ambassador's quote in the article put it cynically and succinctly, "Politics is about interests. Politics is not about morals."  I believe Mohammed is right.  That these courts aren't better is because, like most governmental services, they have no need: there is no viable alternative.
If one accepts the American Constitutional notion that all rights are originally vested in the sovereign individual and that competition is usually the best path to maximizing quality of a service, then a clear path extends to a market based solution.  Effective private justice may not provide a fairer outcome but it will offer an alternative which will challenge the current tribunals and their masters to either abandon pretexts that they are impartial, abandon the tribunals altogether or improve them.
Any attempt to establish a private global (as opposed to international, as in between nations) justice system are likely to be met with harsh responses by the major nation states.  They don't want the competition and some of their current or former leaders and their lieutenants could be the first facing indictments.  So, anonymity of supporters is a prerequisite.
The Internet has shown us that it can be an effective medium for annealing those with out of the mainstream political views into formidable groups whilst offering effective privacy. Money often buys justice.  So, a means for moralists to anonymously fund their interests is needed.  Fortunately, a number of effective and popular electronic currencies (e.g., e-gold) with adequate privacy features exist.
Every successful social movement requires leadership.  Hopefully someone of great character and stature will step forward or emerge and take the reins to either bring all to account for their war crime actions (by whatever means necessary) or thwart (by whatever means necessary) the ability of the U.N. tribunals to operate from their baseless pedestal.

She was hoping that the guy would appear at the funeral again.
If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test

Hand-Held Device for DVD Movies Raises Legal Issues
PARIS -- Hollywood's bid to control how its movies are copied, stored and played is being tested by an unlikely source: a former French oil engineer in an out-of-the-way Paris suburb, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported.
Henri Crohas's company, Archos SA, makes a small hand-held device, like a bulky Palm Pilot, that can record and then play back scores of movies, TV shows and digital photos on its color screen or a TV set. The gadget -- which in effect does to movies what Apple Computer Inc.'s iPod does to music -- already has sold 100,000 units world-wide during the past six months, beating the big consumer electronics makers to the U.S. market.
Archos's device, which costs about $500 to $900 depending on the model, ignores an anticopying code found on a majority of prerecorded DVDs. That means consumers can plug the Archos device into a DVD player and transfer a movie to it. Users also can transfer recorded TV programs and digital music files to the Archos device. The Archos uses a video compression standard called MPEG-4 to cram as many as 320 hours of video at near-DVD quality onto its hard drive, the company says -- the equivalent of 160 two-hour A second kind of anticopying protection thwarts users from recording a playable copy of a DVD movie onto the hard-drive of a personal computer and then onto the Archos. But videos can be transferred from the Archos to a PC, where they could be burned onto a DVD or sent over the Internet, though that would likely violate copyright laws.
The gadgets alone aren't likely to spawn a Napster-style boom in online film piracy. Already, scofflaws with a PC equipped with a DVD player and special software can rip off films and share them over the Internet. And the process is slow: It takes as long to copy a DVD movie to the Archos device as it does to watch the movie. Still, Mr. Crohas and his 150-employee team at Archos ( pronounced AR kos) present a fresh headache for Hollywood because they show how the industry's campaign to keep control of its films could be challenged by small players.

Scenes From A Sad Airport
         By Mark Morford
         Look at those eyes. Perturbed and bemused and just a little furious.
         Look at those eyes as the baffled woman from east Texas stares down
at the table as the security agent rifles through her luggage and pulls out
the contents for all to see.
         And out pops the skimpy latex thong and the anal beads and the
Astroglide and the smallish travel dildo that isn't really a dildo at all
but is really a "sexual-education device," because, as everyone knows,
dildos are completely illegal in Texas. But not guns. Guns are mandatory.
         Note how she notes the irony. Note how she considers suing for
embarrassment and humiliation and for the sheer idiocy of it all. Note how
the security agent mumbles something snide and derogatory.
         Note how we, as a paranoid nation, are just confused and sad and how
our airports have become these comical circus sideshows, invasive and racist
and draconian and pornographic all in the name of, what was it again?
Protection? For our own good? Is that it?
         And look there, look how that conservative Christian U.S.
congressman is just so red faced and enraged when they search through his
manly black Samsonite carry-on and find, well, not just a nice new Bible and
clean white Jockey underwear and assorted envelopes of cash from the
director of Destroy Gay Marriage Now! of Colorado Springs, Colo.
         Look there, just under the argyle sweaters and the signed head shot
from Pat Robertson, stash of sticky Honcho magazines and some Hello
Kitty Speedos and, lo and behold, the metal in the congressman's boots
induces an unfortunate backroom strip search, where what do we see but the
assorted bright red welts of spankdom as incurred from Mistress Carlita's
Pleasure Bunker in downtown Phoenix, from the night before. Oh, Congressman.
         Do you hear that? That screaming? Of course you do. Just another
outraged mother of three, her appalled shouts echoing all the way to the
food court as LAX security gropes the living hell out of her stunned
2-year-old daughter after the tot's teddy bear appeared to have some
odd-looking wiring in its cute fuzzy little arms.
         And the mother up and slaps the scowling groping security agent and
alarms are sounded and guns are drawn and children are screaming and
Spongebob backpacks tumble to the ground and spill their bright happy
contents all over the stained tiles in terrible slow motion, like a bad
Tarantino outtake.
         And thus were lines held up and 16 flights from Dulles and O'Hare
and JFK delayed for nine hours, causing a domino-effect 27-hour backup
systemwide and thusly pumping yet another enormous and savage dose of
frustrated rage and angst and sighing ennui into another artery of the
cultural bloodstream.
         Look. Look there. See the hobbled, 86-year-old man forced to put
down his cane and remove his threadbare belt to pass through the metal
detector. Terrorists are everywhere! Bush said so! We can't be too sure! Do
you have metal pins in your hip, sir? Can you please remove them or
         Let us watch in humiliated shame as he struggles to keep his pants
from falling down as it looks, to all appearances, like he's being led
though a scanner to some horrific prison cell where he will be fed old
oatmeal and dangerous drugs in harsh fluorescent concrete rooms, when all
he's trying to do is fly to Poughkeepsie for his granddaughter's third
         Because God knows you just can't tell who might be a terrorist these
days, and you can't be too careful, because they could indeed be anyone at
all from anywhere at all, including but not at all limited to white Lutheran
octogenarians from the Shady Pines retirement-condo complex in Butte, Mont.
Not to mention them dang furriners.
         Let us now welcome the overwhelmed visitor from China, or Latvia, or
Johannesburg, or Brazil, or India, or (heaven forefend) Turkey. It's OK,
come on out of that plane. Ignore the stun guns and the growling dogs.
America loves you.
         Let us now note how our fair visitor walks into the American
security miasma feeling like she is entering one big draconian maze of weird
overlit American racism and paranoia, as all visitors from all "suspicious"
countries have their photos taken and their fingers imprinted and their
self-respect jolted and their identities filed for 20 years by the FBI, just
in case.
         Welcome to America, foreign traveler. Please hold still and place
your finger here and smile for the camera and enjoy your first taste of our
trademark, wickedly ironic and hypocritical joke about America being the
land of the free. Is that weird necklace a religious symbol or something?
Are those beads filled with white-hot hate for our glorious freedoms and our
24-hour Safeways and our love of low-rise jeans on teenage girls? Are you in
some sort of cult?
         Repeat after us: Bring us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to have their spirits snapped like chicken bones and be made to
feel as if they are all, by default, criminals and thieves and Bush's
"gol-dang guilty durty heathen furriners." Thank you. Please proceed like
mad cow-infested cattle to the next airport screening agent.
         Just a couple questions at this point. Do you have any nasty
homemade bombs or lethal biotoxic intentions or rampant simmering hatreds of
George W. Bush on your person at this time? Damn right you don't. Now please
proceed to the painful urine-sample room to have your dignity forcibly
removed. Souvenir?
         Look closer. Look domestic. See how so many Americans standing in
all the various airport lines for 2.7 hours seem to just sigh and suck it
         See how they all cast their eyes down and tolerate the multiple
driver's-license checks and the general insanity and the obvious
government-sponsored invasions of privacy and the happy perky assaults on
our civil liberties because, well, it's for our own good, right?
         All in the name of inducing a bogus feeling of protection and safety
and never you mind America's hilarious gaping arcade of exploitable
opportunities for terrorism, from our huge wide-open shipping ports to the
intricately distributed unprotected food supply to our antiquated water
systems to a thousand other ridiculously obvious apertures.
         And never mind that even tiny raging splinter-cell terrorists aren't
so stupid as to try the same vile hijack stunt twice. And never you mind
that none of this would've stopped any of the 9/11 thugs. But oh yes, let's
fingerprint old ladies from Latvia. That oughta do it.
         Wait, you're from Andorra? Wonderful! You're perfectly OK and we
need no fingerprints. Come on in. Ditto Australia. And Austria. And Belgium,
Brunei, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, San
Marino, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Portugal and
         Hey, you couldn't possibly hate America enough to wish us harm.
Could you? Besides, we stop only swarthy Third World types and guys with
scary-looking beards and unpronounceable names that sound like rare kidney
         Welcome, all, to the new-millennium American airport. Observe the
perfectly imperfect microcosm of new American ideals and values, all about
isolationism and quiet cancerous paranoia and a huge increase in government
employment and expenditure and bureaucracy and very sorry but you can't
bring that coffee into the boarding area.
         Welcome to the all-American fear of the Other, coupled with a sad
acceptance that this is the way it is and the way it will be for years and
years to come. Please remove your shoes. And your belt. And your watch. And
your self-respect. Bush forever. More war in '04. Enjoy your flight.

The Whigs pushed their internal improvements agenda (building unneeded and/or grossly overpriced roads, bridges or canals supplied by political contributors) across all the states in the early 1800s.

Not surprising considering the lack of preparation most get today in school.
As has been discussed on this list many who graduated college before the late '70s were able to pursue independent science experimentation (esp. chemistry and rocketry, etc.).  Now almost all science can only be learned in the classroom.  Many of the greatest scientific break throughs were made by amateurs.  We'll probably never know what new ideas were never thought, or were greatly delayed, because young minds in science were only channeled through the rote of the classroom.

Hand-Held Device for DVD Movies Raises Legal Issues
PARIS -- Hollywood's bid to control how its movies are copied, stored and played is being tested by an unlikely source: a former French oil engineer in an out-of-the-way Paris suburb, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported.
Henri Crohas's company, Archos SA, makes a small hand-held device, like a bulky Palm Pilot, that can record and then play back scores of movies, TV shows and digital photos on its color screen or a TV set. The gadget -- which in effect does to movies what Apple Computer Inc.'s iPod does to music -- already has sold 100,000 units world-wide during the past six months, beating the big consumer electronics makers to the U.S. market.
Archos's device, which costs about $500 to $900 depending on the model, ignores an anticopying code found on a majority of prerecorded DVDs. That means consumers can plug the Archos device into a DVD player and transfer a movie to it. Users also can transfer recorded TV programs and digital music files to the Archos device. The Archos uses a video compression standard called MPEG-4 to cram as many as 320 hours of video at near-DVD quality onto its hard drive, the company says -- the equivalent of 160 two-hour A second kind of anticopying protection thwarts users from recording a playable copy of a DVD movie onto the hard-drive of a personal computer and then onto the Archos. But videos can be transferred from the Archos to a PC, where they could be burned onto a DVD or sent over the Internet, though that would likely violate copyright laws.
The gadgets alone aren't likely to spawn a Napster-style boom in online film piracy. Already, scofflaws with a PC equipped with a DVD player and special software can rip off films and share them over the Internet. And the process is slow: It takes as long to copy a DVD movie to the Archos device as it does to watch the movie. Still, Mr. Crohas and his 150-employee team at Archos ( pronounced AR kos) present a fresh headache for Hollywood because they show how the industry's campaign to keep control of its films could be challenged by small players.

While this is certainly a value judgement, almost every other nation thinks so.
Its fair if each party is free to select its own basis for selecting candidates.  That way voters can take into consideration both the party and individual ideology and any geographical interests before deciding what party to vote for.  The most important thing, in my opinion, is that the number of seats is awarded by, in our situation, state election results and not solely by district where independent candidates will almost never represent a majority and thus never get elected to office.
In some countries parties select candidates to fill seats awarded in an election, in others candidates for each party are selected in a primary election and (e.g., based on votes per candidate received) seat the candidates in order of popularity, in still other countries voters are free to write in candidate names.  I prefer some combination of the last two methods plus some localization means to prevent the major population centers from monopolizing candidate selection.  This might involve some sort of district rotation or randomization so that primary election candidates would be required to come from only those districts in the rotation.  I am sure there are other means to address this issue.

Although some voters registered with minority parties do indeed cross lines and vote for the majority candidate they feel is the lesser of two evils, they are not the focus of my interest but rather what representation is afforded those that do vote with their registered parties.  In almost all other democracies independent voter turnouts in the magnitude of U.S. elections would guarantee at least one seat in a state (equivalent) or national assembly.  But in the U.S these voters are being denied effective  representation (and here 'effective' cannot be defined to mean the choice of the majority when voting is by district which eliminates any practical chance that a minority party candidate can be seated).
No, but voters should be able to withhold their tax money, where possible, until they do.  I think these disenfranchised voters would feel much less damaged if they weren't financially supporting a such an undemocratic system.
You are attempting to substitute an inherently winner-take-all contest for the legislative contests I have been discussing.  One has nothing to do with the other.
Its only 'wasted' because there is no chance that a majority in their voting district will also vote for the same candidate.
The manners for the selection of candidates under a proportional system are varied but well understood outside the U.S.  Perhaps these links might educate:   and No, the reason the U.S. has a fixation on voting for one of two major parties is because of a lack of proportional representation like elsewhere.  I am certain you have the cause and effect interchanged.
I am not discussing presidential elections, this is another matter.
The part that isn't proportional has to do with the very establishment of 'voting districts' within the states that are the key to the two major parties maintaining their electoral monopolies.

Representation is about interests and ideology.  If a significant segment of voters don't get anyone to represent these interests and ideologies bad things can happen (e.g., they can become radicalized).  Representation can be an important outlet for these disenfranchised voters.
The problem is that use of voting districts seems to have always resulted in gerrymandering in our political system.  A proportional system can eliminate these geopolitical distortions.

Hey Dude, Where's My Rep?
The rallying cry of American Colonists was "No Taxation Without Representation".  Although U.S politicians frequently present their political system as some paragon of representative democracy, I am unaware of any country since the Civil War adopting this winner-take-all, gerrymandered, model.  Almost all opted for a parliamentary system with proportional representation.  Today, unless you vote either Republican or Democrat you are effectively denied representation.  Almost no independent candidates are ever elected to U.S. state, not alone federal office, even though in other democracies some would surely have gotten members of their party seated.  If one accepts that the American Colonists were right to refuse to pay taxes to the British Crown until they received representation then why should today's independent voters pay state and federal taxes?

The Mother Jones article link to by this article spouts the same gun-control BS that the liberal press repeats ad nauseam day in and day out.  "Regarding the second broad question of individual versus state-militia rights, the Court held in its 1939 United States v. Miller decision that individuals have in effect no right to keep and bear arms under the amendment, but only a collective right having "some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia." Lower courts have consistently applied the Miller decision in upholding various gun-control laws over the years. "
Not quite.
Recent History
The story begins with the National Firearms Act of 1934, which was the first federal law regulating firearms. Prior to that time, it was generally believed that the Constitution did not grant the federal government this power. The Firearms Act levied a prohibitive $200 dollar tax on machine guns and sawed off shotguns. Government officials claimed that these were the weapons of choice for the criminal gangs that evolved during prohibition.
This law was enacted during a period when a determined effort was being made to expand federal police power at the expense of the states. A crafty legislative tactic of that time was to construct new federal criminal laws as commerce measures, which could be justified as revenue producers in the event they were challenged by supporters of state's rights. Some have speculated that the 1934 Firearms Act was passed to provide job security for federal agents who were threatened with unemployment by the repeal of alcohol prohibition in 1933.
Like most criminal cases, U.S. v. Miller involved some unsavory characters. Jack Miller, a bank robber and moonshiner with many enemies, felt the need to carry a sawed off shotgun without paying the tax. He and his associate, Frank Layton, had the misfortune to be caught transporting it from Oklahoma to Arkansas and were arrested in June of 1938 by federal agents on charges of violating the Firearms Act.
They were brought before United States District Court Judge Heartsill Ragon in Fort Smith, Arkansas who encouraged them to plead not guilty and appointed an attorney to represent them. He then found in their favor, declaring that the relevant section of the Firearms Act was in violation of the Second Amendment and therefore unconstitutional.
Federal law enforcement authorities were not pleased. Judge Ragon's decision threatened the expansion of federal power, so the case was quickly appealed to the Supreme Court. Jack could not afford legal representation and died of gunshot wounds before the hearing date. His co-defendant Frank Layton apparently decided he wasn't interested in defending his or our rights under the 2nd and took four years probation.
That a Supreme Court case could be decided without the court hearing both sides of the argument seems bizarre. Yet this was the perfect opportunity for advocates of greater federal power to advance their agenda. With no opposition, they could not lose. Despite the lack of defendant representation the opinion, written by Justice James Clark McReynolds, was notable in that it did not completely cave in to the government demands. The resulting decision issued in May of 1939 stated that "in the absence of any evidence" the Supreme Court could not say that a sawed off shotgun had any relationship to the militia.
The critical point here is the absence of evidence. Of course that was literally correct, since Miller's side never showed up in court. If there had been a N. R. A. Miller might very well have gone differently. After stating the court's opinion, McReynolds included passages from various historical sources to show that the militia consists of all able-bodied men who have a right, perhaps even a duty, to own firearms suitable for military service. There was little reason to include these references unless McReynolds wished to protect the Amendment from further encroachment.
The case was returned to the lower court where Miller, if living, could have made further arguments on his own behalf. He could have easily and correctly argued that short-barreled shotguns had been popular military weapons in the trenches of the First World War. It was lucky for the federal government that he was dead.
Still, the decision set off alarm bells in D.C. Federal prosecutors couldn't wait to weaken Miller. In Cases v. U.S. in 1942 they found their opportunity. The robed ones didn't see a straightforward way to eviscerate Miller. Instead they accepted many of the ruling's conclusions, but tried to draw a fence around it application "However, we do not feel that the Supreme Court in Miller was attempting to formulate a general rule applicable to all cases."
"In view of this, if the rule of the Miller case is general and complete, the result would follow that, under present day conditions, the federal government would be empowered only to regulate the possession or use of weapons such as a flintlock musket ... But to hold that the Second Amendment limits the federal government to regulations concerning only weapons which can be classed as antiques or curiosities -- almost any other might bear some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia unit of the present day -- is in effect to hold that the limitation of the Second Amendment is absolute."
"Another objection to the rule of the Miller case as a full and general statement is that according to it Congress would be prevented by the Second Amendment from regulating the possession or use by private persons not present or prospective members of any military unit, of distinctly military arms, such as machine guns, trench mortars, anti-tank or anti-aircraft guns, even though under the circumstances surrounding such possession or use it would be inconceivable that a private person could have any legitimate reason for having such a weapon."
Right, what legitimate reason does Steve Schear have for keeping a fully armed tank in their back yard? While this certainly seems reasonable to most citizens, was this type of limitation intended when the Framers drafted the 2nd?
Does Original Intent still matter?
According to Mr Lessig's analysis of Supreme Court judicial conduct, "Translating Federalism: United States v Lopez," one of the challenges faced by those attempting to interpret the Constitution is that there has been a qualitative change in the depth of understanding of common citizens regarding the "fictions" and "conventions" that underlie it. He cites de Tocqueville, following his early 1800s U.S. tour, to support the assumption that "The government of the Union rests almost entirely on legal fictions. The Union is an ideal nation which exists, so to say, only in men's minds and whose extent and limits can only be discerned by the understanding. Everything in such a government depends on artificially contrived conventions, and it is only suited to a people long accustomed to manage its affairs, and one in which even the lowest ranks of society have an appreciation of political science."
The system is not fundamentally different, in this sense, from baseball: For no one would say that baseball is just the rules of the game; more than the rules, it is the understandings of those rules, and the practices that they envision, that constitute the knowledge necessary to play the game. But what happens when this "diverse knowledge and discernment" disappear? When these "artificially contrived conventions" lapse, how does a constitutional regime respond? More particularly, how does written constitution survive when the "fictions" upon which it rested indeed become fiction? His answer is not very well.
This is the distinctive feature of constitutionalism in America. It is not that conventions and understandings behind the constitutional text disappear; it is that they change. They change both in their substance, and in their location: They not only direct different readings of the constitutional text, but they are possessed, or understood, no longer by "the common people," instead by a constitutional elite lawyers, law professors, and members of government. The distinctive problem of American constitutionalism is how to read this constitutional text, when these understandings are fundamentally different from what they were. The result of this erosion of common understanding is that the Supreme Court swings, sometimes wildly, between two poles Mr. Lessig calls "orginalism" and Originalism attempts to maintain fidelity and articulate these previously understood conventions, and apply them today to assure that the constitutional structure original established is, so far as possible, preserved. The effort, we could say, is to translate that original structure into the context of today. Texturalism is less focused on fidelity. Its method is more direct. It simply reads a text according to relatively simple rules of interpretation, finding that understanding of the text that is most compelling in the current context. It doesn't worry whether that current reading is the original reading. It aims simply at finding a reading that coheres best with what is now understood to be the case.
Though many of today's citizens and judiciary are most comfortable with a texturalistic interpretation, in my view only an originalistic reading is acceptable. Texturalism is a slippery slope which encourages a "make it up as you go along" ethic. It is in just this situation we find ourselves in today regarding the 2nd Amendment.
Our Radical Beginnings
 From the Declaration of Independence the right of individuals to overthrow their governments when THEY feel that it has been enshrined. While some might insist that Constitutional Amendments or massive civil unrest is the only legitimate means of achieving fundamental change, I would remind you that only a relative minority of American Colonials took an active part in the Revolution. Even Lincoln, watching the storm clouds approach over secession, recognized this right for violent overthrow.
"Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of
amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it."

Mark Weston, technology law specialist at MAB Law, says the ruling was another link in the chain of judicial authority saying that you cannot be anonymous. He likened this element of the ruling to cases where ISPs have been forced to reveal the identity of filesharers to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).
"It should make posters more careful. The supposed anonymity online is only temporary," he told us. "Just as in the offline world, as long as someone knows who you are, they can be forced to reveal your identity."

especially if you've got to do a DNS lookup or two.
Horizontally directional perhaps not but vertically is a possibility.  By this I mean an omni antenna with gain, like a stacked dipole.  What this means is antenna with gain in all compass points but with a flat 'pancake' vertical profile.  In many driving situations the hot spot is likely to be within 10 degrees of horizontal. They are commonly used in commercial TV and radio broadcast.   I think its possible to get 6 or more db gain this way with a small antenna.  6 db effectively doubles your range.

[Read the paper here:   Very interesting stuff, but not likely new to most here.]
The Federal Reserve commissioned me to research and write a
paper on fraud, risk and nonbank payment systems. I found that
phishing is facilitated by payment systems like eGold and Western
Union which make the recovery of stolen funds more difficult.
Traditional payment systems like cheques and credit card payments
are revocable; cheques can bounce and credit card charges can be
charged back. However some modern systems provide irrevocability
without charging an appropriate risk premium, and this attracts
the bad guys. (After I submitted the paper, and before it was
presented on Friday, eGold was indicted.)
I also became convinced that the financial market controls used
to fight fraud, money laundering and terrorist finance have
become unbalanced as they have been beefed up post-9/11. The
modern obsession with 'identity' - of asking even poor people
living in huts in Africa for an ID document and two utility
bills before they can open a bank account - is not only ridiculous
and often discriminatory. It's led banks and regulators to take
their eye off the ball, and to replace risk reduction with due
In real life, following the money is just as important as following
the man. It's time for the system to be rebalanced.
