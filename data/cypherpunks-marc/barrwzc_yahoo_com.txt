Hi, my name is Tiffany!  ;-)
My friend said you were a really cool person and I should get in contact with you!
I looked at your profile and thought I would contact you. I love meeting new people, I also love to talk. I just got my videocam working so you can see me to! It doesn't cost you anything if you wanna watch/see me! You don't even need your own videocam! This is not my screenname, but a friends. To contact me you need to go to my personal site (dont worry it's a FREE site like Yahoo!) its the only way to contact me! My personal site:
Just Copy and Paste in your Broswer
Best of love and regards, Tiffany
