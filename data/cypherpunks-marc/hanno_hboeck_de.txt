There's nothing anywhere close to being a reliable data collection to
answer questions like these.
People tend to base these things on CVE counts, which is the Infosec
equivalent of astrology or homeopathy. Yet that doesn't stop
universities and other "respectably looking" institutions to fall for
this trap on a regular basis.
