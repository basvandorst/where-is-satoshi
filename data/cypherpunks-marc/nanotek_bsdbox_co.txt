No doubt :)
My statement was in reference to the original topic of the graphic and its (perceived) intended meaning.

There is no need. It has been read many times.
Not sure how your suggestion diminishes Tor's utility in circumventing Orwellian policies. Tor is an integral munition in the Constitution-defending arsenal; which would be much weaker without it.

Indeed. The irony only adds to its appeal.
Tor empowers citizens to royally fuck Orwellian tactical planning, such as that which is implemented by the NSA.
The iconography and allegorical-themed narrative is rather accurate. The piece.. like a digital Rembrandt. Really :)
But, I do agree with your summary of the NSA and Tor's prophylactic utility.

Sure. I shared my favoured interpretation earlier.
Beyond that, I see Jefferson fucking Obama from behind (i.e. bucking of ignominious attempts to erode our hard-earned constitutional convention). It is very well done too. Picture perfect!

No. I can't remember reading anything you wrote, let alone disagreeing with it.
I do agree with this.

Really surprising to see such hypocrisy in these circles.
I really didn't get the "rape" vibe from the graphic at all. Like you alluded to earlier, you see what you want to see.

I like the double entendre: FreeBSD > Linux :)
Accurate and funny. Nice work.

Thanks, Viktor. I will conduct some research and weigh my options. Whatever choice, a significant improvement on my current cryptographic protocol will be made.

Thanks, Wietse. Much appreciated. I'll put it to use and let you know if I encounter any problems.
