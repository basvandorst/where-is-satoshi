@_subject: Imagine Bob owns an ISP... 
Hello everyone!
I thought the following question might be of interest: Imagine Bob owns an ISP. Bob doesn't like government agencies very much and has (yet) no surveillence equipment installed. Alice now makes a contract with Bob that he provides internet access to Alice and she pays for it. If Bob is forced to install Carnivore-like equipment or anything of the like, he promises to tell Alice immediately. If he doesn't and Alice finds out, he has to pay [insert very large sum here] $ to Alice.
Now what happens when Bob is legally (or otherwise) forced to make his network a "patriotic" one and isn't allowed to tell Alice?
(as it is proposed in this "Convention on Cyber-Crime" by the European Union; at least that is my reading, which may very well be wrong; but in fact it is of no relevance here)
