No Regrets About Developing PGP
The Friday September 21st Washington Post carried an article by
Ariana Cha that I feel misrepresents my views on the role of PGP
encryption software in the September 11th terrorist attacks.  She
interviewed me on Monday September 17th, and we talked about how I
felt about the possibility that the terrorists might have used PGP in
planning their attack.  The article states that as the inventor of
PGP, I was "overwhelmed with feelings of guilt".  I never implied
that in the interview, and specifically went out of my way to
emphasize to her that that was not the case, and made her repeat back
to me this point so that she would not get it wrong in the article.
This misrepresentation is serious, because it implies that
under the duress of terrorism I have changed my principles on the
importance of cryptography for protecting privacy and civil liberties
in the information age.
Because of the political sensitivity of how my views were to be
expressed, Ms. Cha read to me most of the article by phone before she
submitted it to her editors, and the article had no such statement or
implication when she read it to me.  The article that appeared in the
Post was significantly shorter than the original, and had the
abovementioned crucial change in wording.  I can only speculate that
her editors must have taken some inappropriate liberties in
abbreviating my feelings to such an inaccurate soundbite.
In the interview six days after the attack, we talked about the fact
that I had cried over the heartbreaking tragedy, as everyone else
did.  But the tears were not because of guilt over the fact that I
developed PGP, they were over the human tragedy of it all.  I also
told her about some hate mail I received that blamed me for
developing a technology that could be used by terrorists.  I told her
that I felt bad about the possibility of terrorists using PGP, but
that I also felt that this was outweighed by the fact that PGP was a
tool for human rights around the world, which was my original intent
in developing it ten years ago.  It appears that this nuance of
reasoning was lost on someone at the Washington Post.  I imagine this
may be caused by this newspaper's staff being stretched to their
limits last week.
In these emotional times, we in the crypto community find ourselves
having to defend our technology from well-intentioned but misguided
efforts by politicians to impose new regulations on the use of strong
cryptography.  I do not want to give ammunition to these efforts by
appearing to cave in on my principles.  I think the article correctly
showed that I'm not an ideologue when faced with a tragedy of this
magnitude.  Did I re-examine my principles in the wake of this
tragedy?  Of course I did.  But the outcome of this re-examination
was the same as it was during the years of public debate, that strong
cryptography does more good for a democratic society than harm, even
if it can be used by terrorists.  Read my lips: I have no regrets
about developing PGP.
The question of whether strong cryptography should be restricted by
the government was debated all through the 1990's.  This debate had
the participation of the White House, the NSA, the FBI, the courts,
the Congress, the computer industry, civilian academia, and the
press.  This debate fully took into account the question of
terrorists using strong crypto, and in fact, that was one of the core
issues of the debate.  Nonetheless, society's collective decision
(over the FBI's objections) was that on the whole, we would be better
off with strong crypto, unencumbered with government back doors.  The
export controls were lifted and no domestic controls were imposed.  I
feel this was a good decision, because we took the time and had such
broad expert participation.  Under the present emotional pressure, if
we make a rash decision to reverse such a careful decision, it will
only lead to terrible mistakes that will not only hurt our democracy,
but will also increase the vulnerability of our national information
PGP users should rest assured that I would still not acquiesce to any
back doors in PGP.
It is noteworthy that I had only received a single piece of hate mail
on this subject.  Because of all the press interviews I was dealing
with, I did not have time to quietly compose a carefully worded reply
to the hate mail, so I did not send a reply at all.  After the
appeared, I received hundreds of supportive emails, flooding in at
or three per minute on the day of the article.
I have always enjoyed good relations with the press over the past
decade, especially with the Washington Post.  I'm sure they will get
it right next time.

Of course, but I don't see how that advances any discussion of what ACTUALLY
happened on the 11th.  I don't think there is any reason to engage in a
theoretical discussion when we have such a concrete event to examine.  I'll

Apples and oranges.  There is a world of difference between targeting
innocents (the focus of my post) and targeting military targets with
resultant innocent casualties.  If a gunman grabs a human shield and starts
shooting at me, I will (regrettably) return fire.  Hopefully, I'll hit the
bad guy and not the innocent human shield, but if I do hit the hostage, the
moral responsibility is on bad guy, not me.

Who said anything about profit?  The point under discussion was cost/benefit
analysis.  Don't engage in Inchoate over-simplification.  Neither cost nor
benefit is limited to monetary profit or loss.
Here's a silly example.  Let us suppose the terrorists are Muslims.  It has
been reported that the body of one of the terrorist pilots has been
recovered.  Perhaps future Muslim terrorists might deem costs too high if
that body were fed to pigs and the resulting pig shit dropped on Kabul (or
maybe that would just increase the "benefit" of killing more innocents).  In
either case the cost and benefit have nothing to do with profit.

Thanks, but I'd go a bit further.  The percentage of humans who would be
capable of such evil has to be vanishingly small.  Unfortunately, that
percentage is not zero so this sort of thing continues to happen.
We have to assume it because it demonstrably exists.  The trick then is, to
make the costs greater or the benefits less.  Easier said then done, but
those are our only alternatives.
I think a much strong argument can be made that those who do not believe in
an afterlife would be more deterred than those who do.
Yeah, but it's that once that counts forever.  In any event, that's the
situation in which we live.  There will always be that tiny minority that
will do evil.  The rest of us are left to monkey with the cost/benefit to
reduce the incidences of such evil.  Life goes on.
And so far, unsupported by the facts.  Time will tell.  In the mean time,

Nonsense.  Targeting innocents is evil according to EVERY human culture.
The fact that people do it, does not make it "relative."  It just makes them
evil.  Period.
When generals close to Hitler saw the writing on the wall, their basic
humanity drove them to try to blow him up.  Had they succeeded they would
have ended a great evil and prevented ALL the evil excesses of the
WWII--from the holocaust to Dresden to Hiroshima.  What they did was not
evil, but moral.  Unfortunately, they failed.

I have NO IDEA what this strange post has to do with the original question.
I'm a libertarian.  As such, I see no problem in doing well by doing good.
Just because I would jump at $5 million (plus Witness Relocation) to finger
Bin Laden does not mean I would do something evil for that amount or more.
Remember, the original question was, would a $5 million reward plus a new
identity under the Witness Relocation Program be enticing enough to get
someone to roll over on Bin Laden.  My best guess is 'yes' and I merely used
myself as an example.
Look, I don't CARE about the purity of the motives of someone who would give
up Bin Laden.  The only question in my mind is whether or not there is
somebody who would do it for the stipulated inducement.  That was--and
is--the question.

In this case, yes.  When the program failed in the past it was usually due
to putting formally high rollers into dull middle class new lives.  They
were the ones who ended up outing themselves.  In contrast, giving some poor
wretch and his family $5 million would put them in the lap of luxury.
Cost/benefit, you do the math.  I'd opt for it in a heartbeat.

There is an unpublished story about Robert Heinlein that was told to me by

Ginny lived in the Santa Cruz mountains, not that far from Tim (hmm, maybe
it's something in the water).  Their house was circular and their property
was surrounded by a high chain-link fence with a razor wire on the top (if
memory serves).
Anyway, one day someone came to the gait and sounded the buzzer.  Robert
asked them through the intercom who they were and what they wanted.  They
said they were from the IRS.  When Robert asked them if they had an
appointment, there was a long silence followed by the statement, "No, but
we've driven all the way from San Jose to talk to you about your account."
Mr. Heinlein turned off the intercom and buzzer and went back to his
business.  That was the last he heard from the IRS.

I then asked them why they were there.  When they told me, I said, "I'm not

they left without further comment.

of the mercenaries nor that the two might have a community of interest in

I have been saying for 15 years that the solution to hijackings/kidnappings
is bounty insurance.  (A relatively small premium pays for a $10,000,000--or
more--bounty on the heads of those who kidnap and kill an insured person.)

I ran into a western version of "hawala" about 15 years ago.  It was a
"blocked currency" service offered by a financial group.  Here's how it
If you live in a currency-blocked country (South African was one, I think it
still might be) you couldn't legally move more than a certain amount out
money out of the country.  To get around this, you would be asked to tear a
small denomination piece of paper money (e.g., a 1 rand note) in half.  You
would keep one half and the financial group would get the other half.  Both
halves of the bill would have the same serial number, of course.
Later, you would get a call telling you where to take the cash you wished to
move out of the country.  At the appointed time and place an agent of the
financial group would meet you.  To prove he was the right guy, he would
present the group's half of the bill.  You would give him the money and the
next day an equivalent amount would be on deposit in an account in your name
in whatever country (and currency) you specified.  The fee for this was
usually just the normal money changer's exchange rate.  Of course, the
original cash never left South Africa, just as the cash in the hawala system
never leaves the countries in question either.
One more aside.  For a brief period when New Zealand was heavily socialist,
the government wanted to stop people from traveling (and spending money)
abroad.  Instead of banning travel, which would have caused a shit storm of
controversy, thy just limited the amount of cash that could be taken out of
the country to something like a few hundred bucks.  Of course, resourceful
Kiwis just used their credit cards...

Tell that to the 7th kine.  In reality, subsistence (this word means
something) farmers were mostly chronically malnourished--even in the good
times--and died in droves whenever the sun didn't shine or the rain didn't
fall.  I don't consider that doing "alright."
Can you be more specific?  "Corporate welfare" such as making the rain fall
or what?
You tell me.  It would appear that either you are wrong about the economic
viability of their farms or they are somehow acting against their own best
interest.  Subsistence farmers are going to the cities because they
(correctly) understand that to do so increases their standard of living.
Even assuming, arguendo, that this is true (evidence, please), this is not a
failure of the market or the fault of the "sweat shop" operators.  In fact,
the "sweat shop" operators are the only heroes in this scenario.  They are
at least providing something better than the dislocated farmers would have
had otherwise.  Good for them.

Word of the Day for Tuesday October 26, 1999:
inchoate \in-KOH-it\, adjective:
1. Recently, or just, begun; beginning.
2. Partially but not fully in existence or operation; existing in its
elements; incomplete; imperfectly formed; as, "a vague inchoate idea".
Writers basically work by instinct - I think you have only an inchoate sense
of what you're doing.
--John Gregory Dunne, quoted in "How John Gregory Dunne Puts Himself Into
Books," New York Times, May 3, 1982
You take on a project because of the feeling, perhaps inchoate, that it may
in some way contribute to your deeper understanding of the larger-scale
research program you have chosen as your life's work.
--Christopher Scholz, Fieldwork: A Geologist's Memoir of the Kalahari
Still, if I'm honest, the most thrilling moments all came early, in the
Fifties and Sixties, when the music was a primary focus of my energy,
shaping my desires, coloring my memory, and producing the wild fantasy,
widely shared, that my generation was, in some inchoate way, through the
simple pleasure we all took in rock and roll, part of a new world dawning.
--James Miller, Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947-1977
Inchoate is from Latin inchoatus ("only begun, not finished, incomplete"),
past participle of inchoo, inchoare, which is an alteration of incoho,
incohare, to begin.

you have been shoot, gardening or house cleaning.

US postal regs end at the US border.  The rest of the world is full of mail
drops, accommodation addresses and mail forwarding services.

Ken Brown quoted Tim May (I think) saying:
Won't work on Berkeley, though.  The City Council declared Berkeley a
"Nuclear Free Zone."  Guess that leaves only conventional weapons.

Yes, a corollary to 2) is that by saving our fellow man, we are saving
ourselves as well.  The elitist idea that it doesn't make any difference
what happens to the little people is wrong-headed.  Because the world is set
up to make cars affordable for the little people, you and I can have
personal automotive transportation at a fraction of the cost if we were to
try and assemble them up in Galt's Gulch.  If crypto gets wide-spread use by
the little people, our use will be lost in the noise.

Further follow-up:
"On April 30, 1921, The Port of New York Authority was established as the
first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and the first interstate agency
created under a clause of the Constitution permitting compacts between
states. One area of jurisdiction was called the "Port District," a bistate
region of about 1,500 square miles centered on the Statue of Liberty. The
name was changed to The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1972 to
identify more accurately our status as a bistate agency."
Looks as though Jimbo now needs a remedial Constitution-reading course...

Inchoate pontificated:
Gee, that'll be news to the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, the
Mid-America Regional Council and a plethora of other interstate compacts,
authorities and organizations.

If the law of gravity is fundamental, why can't it be changed
by Constitutional amendment since it's the primary authority?

Jimbo really stretched on this one:
But states DO make compacts 'BETWEEN THEMSELVES,' which is what Jimbo said
was unconstitutional.  The fact that they have congressional approval, does
not alter the nature of the agreement nor of the parties.  The "remedial
reading" ball is demonstrably and forcefully served back to Jimbo's court.
I await his next cowardly volley with amusement.  But unless he says
something a bit meatier than his foregoing thin gruel, I doubt I'll be
motivated to respond.  It's just no fun anymore; he's too easy.  :'D

Just to put the final nail in the coffin, Inchoate wrote this:
Then when confronted with evidence that such agreements aren't
unconstitutional, backpedaled to this:
Then silence.
Of course, it takes courage to admit it when you are wrong, so no surprise
