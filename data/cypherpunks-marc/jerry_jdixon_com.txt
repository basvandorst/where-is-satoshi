It's more of a strategy to centralize protection efforts versus using a
de-centralized approach.  I want go into the scalability issues and also
"scope" creep aspects however, as Chris points out, it would be far better
to share indications & warnings with organizations that can leverage their
own security infrastructure to protect themselves.  Organizations have
different risk management profiles meaning they know what is important to
protect to sustain their business and will make decisions based off of
You can share this information automated style depending on your level of
trust of what is being provided so things can move at the speed of light so
to speak however this is still, yet another, reactive approach.  We all
know the issues of signature based systems.  However, their intent is good
and all about protecting the country.  The approach can be debated though :)
