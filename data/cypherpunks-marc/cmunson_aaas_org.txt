Anne, thanks for responding to us.
   Does Yahoo! have policies about what they WON'T link to? It seems that    I've had consistent problems getting Yahoo! to link to parts of my    sites that, while they may be lower down on the hierarchy, are still    full-fledged "bibliographic" or "intellectual" projects. For example,    I run a political site in my free time which has the main page    included in Yahoo! and a sub-project called "The TAZ" which is a    Yahoo-like index to that political persuasion. I've also had similar    problems with work-related sites.
   The site also has an e-zine, which is one of the original e-zines, and    I've had difficulty getting that added. Finally, I'm bewildered that a    alternative newswire page that is at the site which contains news    articles from a variety of alternative news services, can't get a link    in Yahoo!s "Newswire" section.
You all should be commended for all the work you do. I find Yahoo! to be one of my favorite web sites and I've been surfing since One final aside, can you shed any light on why the anarchist stuff was moved from Government:Politics:Political Opinion:Anarchism to Arts:Humanities:Philosophy:Political Theory:Anarchism?
Revolting webmasters want to know. ;-)
