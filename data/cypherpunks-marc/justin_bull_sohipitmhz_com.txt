As a beginner in the crypto field, I thought Tor was actually quite secure.
Seeing that is not the case, what is regarded as a safe, anonymous browsing
practise? And, as far as I know, monitoring an exit node only reveals the
destination address, not the sender... Is that really a security issue?

I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't take too long before Wikileaks became a
very interesting target to the US gov't and her allies. I don't think Tor
operators will get too much flak in terms of personality or MO, but this
exposure may cause disruptions to the project.
