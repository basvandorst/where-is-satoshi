This website is one of the locations with useful info.  The email ph.on.twitter is still active and the place to send tor bridge info.

AUPs are rarely enforced.  They are there so they can cut you off if/when someone complains or you do something to annoy them.
In any case, I would run my servers regardless of their AUP.  NO ONE tells me I cannot run sshd or any other of what I consider personally critical apps.  They also don't get to tell me not to run a tor relay.

It would appear that the tor network should include some timing randomization and reordering of packets to thwart such analysis.  Not so much to really slow things down but enough to throw up uncertainty in the packet analyses.

baseband exploits can tamper with airplane/flight mode. it is designed
to prevent transmission, however, the radio can still receive.
get a faraday bag/case instead...

you say this like there's an inexhaustible supply of dedicated
individuals / volunteers able to administer a business entity /
incorporation each with enough autonomy and self sufficiency to avoid
conspiracy charges ... ;)
i am skeptical this can scale in any meaningful sense; still better
than nothing?
the joy of email is that you defer hard problems like unlinkability,
psuedonymity, anonymity to lower layers where possible.=A0 i agree that
"pen register" and other metadata is just as critical to privacy as
content - perhaps more so given the lack of constraints around access
to "pen register" metadata.
did i mention this is a hard problem?

Sounds like for Germany and like countries/laws such servers should be limited to no more than 10k users each to prevent that invasion.

Thank you for raising this topic once again. Toying with the idea of
"better" email for quite some time, I think there's direct and practical
things you can offer,
See  for a small prototype script that
rejects non-PGP mail. Exim seems to have the configuration option for
that somewhat built-in.
I'd go further and forward mail from the mx to hidden services
configurable by the user.
I'd maybe want to limit the amount of email a user can *send* in a given
time span.
I would not want to use VPS for a service like this.
Working on something like it.
Torservers.net is currently a project under a German non-profit. In
Germany, ever email provider with more than 10k users has to provide
lawful interception.
I'd like to see a full design for it first, and then the components, and
the configuration for each component, so this is easy to set up and
replicate by anyone. For example, how do I configure Postfix to relay
certain incoming mail to a configured hidden service, how do I make it
so it only rejects non-PGP mail for some accounts, etc.
