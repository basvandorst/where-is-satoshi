Do you really believe that any other government is less interested in this
than the USA?  I certainly don't.  The only difference is that the USA *
currently* has a very powerful surveillance entity (as do the UK and a
bunch of others), and most other countries *currently* do not.  I do not
believe for a second that the project would be any safer long-term under
the jurisdiction of any other country.  I propose that you actually find a
government of any first-world country that ins't interested in spying on
the rest of the world.  I direct you to
 - and you can
start by corssing off almost every single country on that list.
If "this nasty government" is all you care about, then your security goals
are very short-sighted.   Start worrying about all the other nasty
governments.  I guarantee you there are lots more of them.
