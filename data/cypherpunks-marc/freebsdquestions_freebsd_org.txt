Wearing a cap for health reasons is ok, apart from that it's
churlishly. I'm a rock musician, I don't care much about etiquette, but
I care much about respectfulness of others. There are reasons why we
don't wear a motorcycle helmet and sunglasses, if there is no need to do
that. We also don't use a smart phone, if we are in a discussion. Oh
wait, you are right, we are in 2018, indeed all those idiots are using
smart phones when being in a discussion, when being on work, when
having fun with friends, when crossing a road. However, this are just
ugly fashions. We don't know, perhaps the one talking to the audience
suffers from a disease, so e should be careful with admonitions.
