Found some interesting news on reddit.    I dont know the tech behind it, but is sounds like playing with Clock allows you to get the IP address of the hidden service
Is this something to be worried about?

Just thought I'd Add my 2c here. Limiting my response Only regarding home Wireless access in the US.   I was involved in a case with just this situation.
According to my lawyer there is no consensus on who is responsible for wifi.  Every State has different laws each one is just a vague.
In NY, if your wireless is secured (pw protected) you are ok.
In NH, you are responsible for all data that passes your wifi point secured or not.
In MA(my state)  there is no specific law...you just need a good lawyer  :)
