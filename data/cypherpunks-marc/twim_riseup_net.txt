NB: Sorry for breaking the threading. Replying to the right message.
I haven't chosen any storage model. I'm just wondering about technical
capabilities of Tor to act as _anonymous_ transport for this data.
"Will one be anonymous when they transmit big amount of data?"
"What the limits are?"
"What step should the source take to be safe?"
The Internet is not confidential. Surely the opposite.
Yes, but there are much more adversaries. Any AS near the endpoints
poses big threat.
The source can easily fail by compromising fingerprints, chemical
traces, serial number of the hard drive (with proprietary firmware!),
place of origin and other 'physical' metadata. It's not "just
ciphertext" in a vacuum.

@_subject: [tor-dev] Is it possible to leak huge load of data over onions? 
Recently someone leaked enormous amount of docs (2.6 TiB) to the
journalists [1]. It's still hard to do such thing even over plain old
Internet. Highly possible that these docs were transfered on a physical
hard drive despite doing so is really *risky*.
Anyways, in the framework of anonymous whistleblowing, i.e. SecureDrop
and Tor specifically it's seems to be an interesting case. I'm wondering
about the following aspects:
    o   Even if we use exit mode/non-anonymous onions (RSOS)
        is such leaking reliable? The primary issue here
        is time of transmission. It's much longer than any
        time period we have in Tor.
    o   What is going to happen with the connection after
        the HS republishes its descriptor? Long after?
        [This one is probably fine if we are not using
         IPs, but...]
    o	Most importantly, is transferring data on >1 TiB
        scale (or just transferring data for days) safe at
        all? At least the source should not change their
        location/RP/circuits. Or need to pack all this stuff
        into chunks and send them separately. It's not
        obvious how it can be done properly. So at what
        point the source should stop the transmission
        (size/time/etc)/change location or the guard/
        pick new RP?
