AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report.
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET!
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program
(USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the
woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet.
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the
bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.
"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old
woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my
husband earns in a year".
The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he
worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect
that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in
the closet.
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of
"Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.
"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on
it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the
top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the
top of the list.
The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars
in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.
"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had
1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow
slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter.
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to
the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail."The money
just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his bike to
several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties,
fifties and hundreds.
"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different
banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell
the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really
strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my
dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down
the street (laughs)."
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The reporting
news team examined and
investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found
that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was completely legal
according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or
Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal
regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or
service must be exchanged for money received.
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
"Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter legal
because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar

appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN
USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].
