You mean like "Someone is abrasive on mailing lists all. the. time. Let's talk to them about it in private, oh they are still abrasive,
let's talk to them in private, oh, now they are writing weirdly
misogynistic things, let's not let that stand unchallenged, suddenly
they are implicitly threatening you with physical violence.", that
kind of thing?
Where would you go, and what would you do, if you felt physically
threatened by someone, and that same person would be discussing
how to design systems to deal with such situations?
