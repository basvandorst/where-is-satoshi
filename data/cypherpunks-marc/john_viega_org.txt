It=92s clear that, whatever happens to Mr. Igoe, we need to assume that =
we have untrusted=97 even malicious participants in the standards =
process.  It=92s recently become clear that the NSA has no scruples on =
the matter, and I wouldn=92t put it past other governments to attempt to =
subvert the standards process.
If Mr. Igoe is removed, it does not address the problem of how to design =
secure standards in the face of untrusted actors.  For instance, we =
can=92t imagine that everyone trying to subvert the process will come to =
the table with =91NSA=92 as their affiliation=97 we should expect the =
NSA to work indirectly through other people to encourage standards they =
want to see adopted.
It doesn=92t seem too relevant who the chair is=97 we should generally =
assume the chair is an untrusted entity, whether they are willingly =
attempting to subvert the system or not.
For instance, the other co-chair, David McGrew, is someone I personally =
trust.  He=92s a terrific human being, but he and I both have our names =
on the GCM mode of operation.  In retrospect, I think there=92s a =
definitely possibility that GCM became a standard so quickly not because =
of its applicability to high-speed hardware implementations and its lack =
of IPR restrictions (which is what I firmly believed at the time), but =
because the NSA had an easy time breaking the message authentication =
mechanism through side-channel attacks.  I=92d say it=92s absolutely =
possible that the NSA worked through us unknowingly to try to subvert =
the standards process.
In the specific case of GCM, a lot of great work has been done since in =
constant-time implementations that we think protects against =
side-channel attacks.  But I have no idea what the NSA=92s true =
capabilities are=97 and I think that=92s even true for many employees of =
the NSA, which is clearly very compartmentalized.
Until recent revelations, the conventional wisdom seemed to be shifting =
toward people believing that the NSA didn=92t know much about =
cryptography that the rest of the world didn=92t know.  We seemed to =
think that there were far more smart cryptographers in industry and =
academia than hidden away in the bowels of government agencies, and that =
our people probably were making bigger advancements than theirs.
Today, I think we all recognize that=92s a dangerous assumption.  It=92s =
important for us, as part of the standardization process, to assume we =
are living in a world where governments are trying to subvert us, and =
that their capabilities are far greater than we expect.  Along the lines =
of a mail Watson Ladd just sent to this list, I think the CFRG should be =
demanding a *well-vetted* proof of security in the standard model where =
possible, and a well-vetted proof in the random oracle model when not.
But, going beyond that, I think the CFRG should also require some =
evidence that any foreseeable side-channel attack is addressed, under =
the assumption of a large government as an adversary.
As for Mr. Igoe, I think there are a few separate issues here:
1) Does his job as chair put him in a better position to subvert the =
standardization process, or are there appropriate checks and balances?   =
This one is not clear cut to me, as a casual lurker.
2) Does the presence of an NSA employee in this particular leadership =
position undermine public trust in the standards body, whether he is in =
a special position to abuse that trust or not?  I think the answer to =
this one is probably YES.
3) Regardless of Mr. Igoe=92s employment, has his behavior been =
inappropriate enough to be grounds for termination?  Here, I think the =
initial concerns that Trevor Perrin raised about Kevin himself can =
possibly be chalked up to mistakes that should deserve a second chance.  =
HOWEVER, I feel that his utter lack of engagement in the discussion is a =
huge issue.
I believe public perception is important to the effectiveness of the =
efforts here, and I think Mr. Igoe=92s lack of interest in engaging is =
not acceptable from someone in a leadership position.  I have less of a =
problem with the strong possibility that he=92s a malicious player=97 =
the presence of such players is just a fact that the CFRG and the IETF =
have to be resilient enough to work around.
that a "witch hunt" is taking place, and that this is all based on =
that this is nothing personal, but an employee of the NSA (one of tens =
or hundreds of thousands) is automatically disqualified from chairing a =
working group.
working group chairs on a regular basis - that they see consensus where =
consensus does not exist. Such arguments are easy to prove or disprove, =
because the mailing lists are public. I've seen plenty of arguments =
about whether the two people + author who liked the proposal vs the one =
person who asked a question and never replied to the list again =
constitute "consensus". None of those arguments resulted in a petition =
to remove the chair. I can only conclude that Kevin is getting special =
treatment because of his organizational affiliation, which IMO sets a =
very bad precedent.=20
are true: that (other than Dan) Kevin had the only message to the CFRG =
list with a favorable opinion of Dragonfly and that he presented that in =
a private message to the TLS chairs as "CFRG is fine with this =
algorithm". This could at worst be construed as mismanagement. Yet =
people present this as a malicious attempt by the USG to subvert the =
standards process so that people authenticate with a method that leaks =
timing information?  At the TLS layer or all places. That accusation is =
baseless and makes no sense for several reasons:
