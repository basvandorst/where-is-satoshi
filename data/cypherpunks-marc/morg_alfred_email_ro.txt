Dear ,
I am Morgan Sido, a consultant to  Mr.SAMUEL  , a nationality of your country,who lived here in Europe
On the 30th of Novenber 2002, he was involved in a car accident on his way to a neighbouring country with all the members of his family.  All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives during that weekend outing.
I have contacted you to assist in repatriating his money  before they are declared unserviceable by the ECO FINANCE AND SECURITIES where this huge deposits was lodged.Particularly, the deceased had Deposited the total Amount of US$14.9 million dollars.
After notification of the death of the deceased to the Finance/Security Company they have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the Funds confisicated within the next 45 days since I endorsed the withness column of the fund deposit when this particular fund was deposited.
I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives all this while till now,that's why I seek your consent to purporting you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this Amount valued at US$14.9 million dollars can be paid to you as the bonafide approved Next of Kin by the Finance/Security Company. If you agree we can discuss the percentage you will have as compensation on your involvement.I have all necessary papers that can be used to back up the facts and claim on the Fund Release. All I require is your honest, cooperation and Sincerity to enable us see this deal go through.
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Awaiting your response.Anyhow you want it to be done will carried out as long as there is full trust on both sides.
Hope to recieve your reply soonest.
