During a recent update and verification of         Washington Mutual Internet Banking Accounts, our system was unable to         fully validate         your account information. There are two possibile explanations: Your current account information has not           been verified in the previous six months; or

As a result, our system has been set to remove your       information completely from the updated security network at the
      completion of the month of January.
 If you wish to exclude your account from the removal         list, please follow the link below. The fields presented in the
