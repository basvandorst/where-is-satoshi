Apologies for what is almost certainly a newbie question, but I've been thinking about this issue for a few days, and I'm not sure I understand the idea of a provably correct compiler in this context.
Is it sufficient for the compiler to be simple enough to audit and to always produce the same binary when given the same source code, say something along the lines of the Small C compiler?
Is something stronger required, where each piece of code in the compiler includes assertions about its input and output, and it's possible to construct a formal proof leading from one to the other, and to link the individual assertions together into a full formal proof of correctness? How would one go about building something like that? I think I could see how to write the correctness proofs at the fairly simple level of turning intermediate code into op-codes, but I'm having some trouble with how to scale up to higher level language constructs while still keeping the proof more abstract than the code it's trying to prove.
Finally, would there need to be restrictions on what the compiler could accept for input or output, or would a general purpose compiler do? I'm guessing that restrictions on the output the compiler could produce, like not linking to external libraries, are not necessary to help with proving the security of the final product, but I'm not sure.
thanks in advance,
