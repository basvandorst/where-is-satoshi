It's about time anyway. Why aren't we using letsencrypt already?

This *only* happens on Google Chrome and Chromium.
Any idea why this might happen?

First of all, I did not humiliate you on a public list. All I said is
**probably** want everyone said (or wanted to say) once: you do annoy a lot
sometimes with a bunch of out-of-context emails that **do** not make any
fucking sense, such as your previous email talking about James sexual
preferences or whatever the fuck (did not read the whole email, it was way
to pathetic to waste time on it).
If you willing to create a chaos and take **any** email personally, then
fine, go for it, or, you can just grew the fuck up, think before you
write/reply an email (specially a public list one).

I don't think you actually understood my point (nor did I actually specify
it precisely).
I did read __some__ of Jame's messages and I think it's also damn pathetic
too. I am not taking any sides here, I just think you are both wrong about
personally attacking each other (or it seems like so at least) on a public
email list on hacker culture.
Wether you take it as a humiliation or not, that's up to you. You should
take it as an advice that even if someone lowers their level, you should
not do the same and perhaps sometimes is better to give a time before
Do whatever is healthier for you.
