@_subject: Re: William was raided for running a Tor exit node. Please help if you can. 
It makes a little.  Last I checked (granted: years ago), a user can steer their traffic to a given exit node; by doing so, they could pick one that they know to have no internal scrutiny (i.e., by the person managing the exit node), while maintaining plausible deniability as to whether the traffic originating from that exit node was theirs, in the event of external scrutiny (as was the case here).
  I suspect running a middle node (not an exit, not an entrance) would provide a similar or greater degree of plausible deniability, albeit without the assurance of no internal scrutiny of the exit node.
