True. Still seems unlikely.
Agreed. I'll see if I can find more abandoned tickets.

I was focusing on getting something that worked well. Not on validating Tor=

I was wondering whether OnionCat opens a new circuit for each packet stream=

s. I suppose that I could log that, and see.
That would be an interesting tweak. I'll look into it.
True. I'll do some more testing.
I know that. But here, once I'd decided to try tinc, using v3 onions seemed=
 like the better option. But yes, I'll do some more testing.
OK, I'll look into it. The internal network is pretty much irrelevant to ho=

This is now at  by the way. It's very=
 easy to test. All that's needed is a Debian stretch x64 VM.
True. And overlays that don't use exits, and provide alternate exits, are u=
But it's still voluntary, right? So one can random walk until non-blocking =
guards are found. I have scripts for that, but didn't need them for this.
Patterns like "Hidden service [x] exceeded launch limit with 10 intro point=

I doubt that Tor will get forked. And why should it, really? It would be fa=

OK, thanks. My best guess then is differences in how Tor handles v2 vs v3 o=
nions. I can't test OnionCat with v3 onions, so I'll do tinc with v2 onions=
