Right now there are changes taking place that have captured our attention.
We have analyzed certain markets and we believe they could present
substantial trading opportunities.  There is a substantial risk of loss in
futures trading.
We have even gone so far as to become registered as Commodity Trading
Advisors (CTA) for the first time in our 20-year history.
Our low-commission, low-minimum Managed Account Program has been launched
and our customers are quite profitable. A copy of our registered CTA
disclosure document is available upon request.
Reply to this email or call me at (317) 848-8050 or (800) 876-8050
to discuss these trading opportunities.
