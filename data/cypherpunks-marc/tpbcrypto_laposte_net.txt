Many people think that if Facebook and Wikipedia use PHP, then PHP may be secure enough to work with money. Meanwhile raw money provides a much bigger bounty than hacking Facebook or Wikipedia, which probably have security holes in numbers that are orders of magnitude more than any small Bitcoin exchange.
That's why properly coded C and Cobol are used by most financial institutions, yes Cobol, as incredible is it may seem, it powers most financial transactions behind fancy web browsers.
Because even if a banking system is simpler than a Wikipedia, its security will be tried many, many, many more times than Wikipedia. While a hack into Wikipedia is something to be concerned about, it won't destroy it, while taking all the money away will destroy a business.
When I referred to games, I was referring to simpler and non-serious systems that people will try to hack in for fun. If you build such system, any system, that's training for some serious stuff in the future.
Ulbricht only knew some PHP coding and looked for help in order to create more advanced stuff, worse yet he had his servers discovered and mirrored and probably exploited before he would even notice it.
How can one be so low in their opsec that he doesn't ship a server for colocation with its USB ports desoldered and plied away? Or at least disabled in the firmware?
All your concerns are valid, meanwhile think about how you could work around every single one of them and note them down. Then once in a while you review your list, until you have solved most theoretical issues.
Then you build a non-serious system and offer bounties for finding exploits and people will find them, because you will never manage to plug all holes and the invader has just to find one hole open.

I can't answer to all your concerns separately as it seems you have got one very big problem: you are into computers, but you have trouble compiling - merely compiling - programs for OpenBSD.
You are in the same boat of Karpeles and Ulbricht, they also were barely able to code some interpreted language and they were overwhelmed by the intricacies of the systems they were building. Until they finally brought disaster for themselves and everyone that depended on them.
In order to grasp the seriousness of things, you gotta start with something simpler which doesn't require so many security skills, like games. Then you build up your knowledge until one day you can make your own exchange.
But until that point, it is irresponsible to try as you have well noticed.
Regarding the rest of your concerns, everything can be dealt with properly, but it takes years of learning. There's a reason computer security professionals are amongst the most well paid employees which big corporations and rich governments only can hire.

@_subject: Re:Fw: Curious Intellectual Property Food-for-thought: "Live-forever Pingers" 
It is not that your idea didn't "stick" but we have a different problem today than two centuries ago when patents were invented.
Patents were invented when people were very ignorant and simple things like boiling cucumbers inside a tightly sealed glass was an innovation that changed the world. Basically anything at that time was something simple yet important enough to warrant a patent.
Until the beginning of the 20th century.
Now as you pointed out, it is not a matter of creating something nobody knows about. All problems are solvable, it is just a matter of someone putting their hands into it.
Big things that would be patentable today, which are not obvious to anyone would be things like Star Wars hovering vehicles, light sabers, etc.
One patentable thing is from a guy that made a new kind of cellphone antenna that tracks the devices and sends individual beams to each device using less power and being much faster, you may have heard about it. That's something which is not easy and cannot be easily done with current technology.
How many times in a year do you hear about such inventions?
But like in ancient times, such wild ideas come out only every once in a while. That wouldn't keep the patent offices, lawyers, attorneys, engineers and all those that orbit around it occupied and pockets filled.
It looks like we ought to find other jobs for such people, otherwise they will fight tooth and nail to continue having every insignificant little invention patentable.

This article makes an interesting point, we got to dig a bit more from our pockets:
The second point I wish to make is the surprise by which the original developer took the issue. Maybe, just maybe, he did not create that flaw at all.
It could have been inserted into the OpenSSL repository through a backdoor ... or why would the spies by so interested in hacking professors that deal with crypto and whose word is trusted by the masses? Like they did to a Belgian cryptographer? Was that fellow nerd a turrist of sorts?
It may be possible that Segelmann did his job correctly, that the reviewer did his job correctly, but someone unknown may have changed it just a little bit before delivery.
Besides funding projects like OpenSSL better, we should start considering the security of the repositories themselves.

Here is your problem, you hold a belief, I hold knowledge. That's the little difference between us. It is not possible to have fast p2p unless:

- People accept a more bumpy internet experience;
The first thing people complained about Tor was that they couldn't run bittorrents with it and they couldn't see youtube.
I would it too, of course. But in order to make it work we have to dial back the complexity of our pages and our want for high definition videos.

Considering the snowden revelations and the fact that one year ago we barely used encrypted transport, having 1/4 already and accelerating is a good prospect.
Fixing the problem is better than overhauling all offices in the world, you clearly haven't been in may offices in your life.

It doesn't matter, if you got a link to the US like citizenship, you are liable to receive a NSL.
If you come from a poorly defended country, like say Saudi Arabia, they will snatch you out to guantanamo.
This kind of problem should be tackled by some honest idealists from either China, Russia, Brazil, India or other big country (Indonesia or Malaysia?) that doesn't extradite and would cause an enormous stink if one of their citizens was taken away to be tortured. If that country would not effectively attack the US in some very painful way.
Like I suppose you are Polish, if you are Polish, Poland itself will give you away to the US at the minimal sign of trouble. I don't blame Poland, it is that or being Russia's bitch. Poor Polen always squeezed.

Would you be in favor of charging someone for possessing things like:
- A catalog of hacking tools;
- Pedophile instruction manual;
- Recipes for preparing human flesh;
Things like that remember me that google once did not have the capacity to exclude links from its systems, but because of pedophiles, they finally built that capacity. The next day the copyright industry was knocking at their door to take down content they previously couldn't because of the lack of technical capacity.
"Now Google don't have excuses." - I remember seeing that phrase in a New York magazine.
The only way to not have people charged because of a book would be to make legal all books no matter what and you guessed it right, it won't happen.
Because you, yourself, will be in favor of indicting people in at least one of the items I quoted, which automatically makes it legal to charge anyone because of possession of any book.

I think frivolous stuff could wait some more ... but you can always bundle several connections by means of bonding interfaces.
I know it is not the best approach, but let's suppose you need to command a robot or conduct a surgery over p2p. Bonding a few openvpn connections together would do the trick.

We all wish privacy, not necessarily 4k videos. The current bandwidth can provide for 4k videos and also privacy, no matter if a littler slower, for a little chat, work and file transfers.
Except if you are into media production or warez, the current bandwidth already does the trick for all the rest.

After Bitcoin is put under governmental control, they can do anything they want without ever being limited or curtailed by us. An example of that is FISA courts and special congressional commissions, that do their jobs without any scrutiny at all.
The consequence is the NSA behavior we see today.
There is no way the ledger will be kept public if the government puts their paws into it, it will be visible to them but not to anybody else, that's the first thing government will do, to cloak it to the best extent possible and force everyone to accept it. They will want that power and control over Bitcoin like they have today over banking transactions and there is not way to stop them if you allow them to control Bitcoin-like systems.
At that point we don't have cryptocurrencies anymore, but only a credit card replacement and nothing great has happened and nothing better has come out of it.
90% of people that would make transactions enforceable by law can continue using credit card, they don't have to wait one hour to confirm their transactions and they can keep paying the fees that guarantee transaction reversibility.

Maybe you are referring to the act of executing the reversion, but it implies lots of responsibilities and infrastructural cost, those things ain't easy.
I do, in my country don't use plastic money much, but we aren't parameter to the rest of the world, either.
Quite the contrary, I think Bitcoin is very successful exactly because of a few things like cheap transactions. When people start to demand reversibility, cheap transactions disappear.
I hope Bitcoin will not be transformed in another credit card system. So, people that want reversibility use one, people that want cheap transactions use the other. There is a place for everyone in this world, as long as banks and government don't push too hard to kill digital currencies.
In that case it will be a war much bigger than paypal takedowns, SOPA or anything that you have seen from the internet until now.

Numbers 1 and 4 are tightly coupled, it is cheap exactly because it is irreversible. If you don't have the cost of executing reversions, neither the infrastructure to do it, that makes Bitcoin-like systems as a whole cheaper.
I dare say we would be better off without transaction reversions, because in the end reversions give people a false sense of security that makes them irresponsible and demands a huge infrastructure to deal with it. The only ones gaining from it are those charging to execute the service itself.

If you want to land on a watch-list and maybe no-fly list, you just install it in your Chrome. Because as far as we can tell Google is in bed with the NSA and so the proprietary browser may just flag you to the system and done you are, or may forward all your messages in the clear. Who knows? Which is worst?
That's why there is not foocking way to trust proprietary software. Companies are forced to act like criminals on behalf of the government. There is no loyalty, respect, ethics, honesty or even business which the US government won't try to trample upon.
If one wants to go crypto, he goes all the way with OpenBSD, Tails, Kali, Gentoo, Firefox, Midori or even old and good Lynx, but not Chrome.

Your proposal would cause 99% of software currently in use to be rejected and make the development costs increase as astronomically as to be compared to medical research.
That would also smother the hopes of all people that see coding and computers as a way out of poverty.
Like, outsourcing stuff to Asia would grind to a halt.
I agree your proposal is good and doable, yet at a cost the world doesn't wish to pay.
It wouldn't reduce innovation, probably would increase it, though. Also it would filter out all incompetents and posers, forcing them to adapt or look at burger flipping in McDonald's with other eyes ...
