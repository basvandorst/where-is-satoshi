News Flash: Sega: Super Monkey Ball™
Sega's                   Super Monkey Ball™
"                         . . . Super Monkey Ball™ has                         sleeper hit written all over it."
 ". . . the end result                         is truly something special." "                         . . . The [control] setup is perhaps the most intuitive                         ever created."                         ". . . the only and ultimate choice for a GameCube party                         game." "It's                   an old-school action-puzzler based on simplicity and dependent                   upon player determination and ultimately skill. It's got great                   level variation, spot-on control and some truly thoughtful,                   well                   created mazes and puzzles"
"On top of everything else, the extra modes                   and multiplayer areas available - Monkey Target, Monkey Fight                   and Monkey Golf being my personal favorite - are better than                   players could have asked for and they go a long, long way to                   enhance the replay value of the title."
