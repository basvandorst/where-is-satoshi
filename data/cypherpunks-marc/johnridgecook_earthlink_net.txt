James Bamford is an author of several books, including some of the first on
the National Security Agency, the code breakers and signals intelligence
operators. He has written a recent book on intelligence manipulation in the
run up to the Iraq war.
During a radio interview he was asked about the Iranian code crack.
His reply, from sources in the NSA-
Current cryptosystems  are very complex and hard (near impossible) to crack.
The way its done now a days (as opposed to WWII Ultra efforts), is to
penetrate an embassy (in this instance, Iran's embassy in Baghdad) and bug
the hardware, getting the information before its encrypted.  Of special
interest- bug the keyboard, bug the monitor, bug the power cord.
How its gathered by the interested parties was not discussed,
