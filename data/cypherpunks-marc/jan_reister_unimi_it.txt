OneSwarm is ap2p application and protocol designed with anonimity,
privacy, adoption (it is also a vanilla BT client) and user control in
mind. The protocol paper (pdf) has a great amount of detail, it also
explicitly compares OneSwarm performance to BT over Tor.
I think the relevance for Tor and this list ends here: it's a very
interesting project, it "works" since a coupple of years, has a sizeable
user base. Further discussion should go to the 1S forums.
