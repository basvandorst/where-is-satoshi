Hi Cypherpunks, Another simple pain treatment  one you can do easily at home  involves applying heat and cold to ease pain.  Apply cold packs to the affected area in the first few days (up to 72 hours), than switch to applying heat for 20 to 30 minutes, three to four times a day.  This may help ease pain by relieving muscle spasm or cramping.  Cold stimulation, such as icing, can also activate the bodys mechanisms that shut down pain signals as they enter the spinal cord.   Applied warmth also decreases stiffness and prepares muscles for stretching.  Deeper heating treatments, such as ultrasound, can be applied for six to eight sessions in conjunction with physical therapy. These techniques prepare the muscles for stretching and may break the pain-tightness-pain cycle.
