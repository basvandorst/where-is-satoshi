Tips About Bad Career Advice
By Kevin DonlinWe've all received bad career advice at some point. Mine came from an aunt who said: "You should be a chemical engineer." Two years of disastrous math study and hundreds of headaches later, I decided she was wrong. Here's some bad career advice on resume writing that my clients have received from friends and co-workers. Suggested solutions follow. Bad Advice  -- Don't sell yourself too hard in your resume.Nonsense. You should claim the highest levels of skill and achievement possible in your resume. This is not being pushy or aggressive. This is being
competitive. You're not the only one who wants that job, after all. Corollary: Selling yourself strongly is not to be confused with making "factually inaccurate statements," i.e., lies. Stick to the truth. It's easier to remember. Bad Advice  -- People don't have time to read a two-page resume."By saying less you are saying more," is what one writer told a client of mine. Rubbish. People don't have time to read a BORING resume or one that's ILL-SUITED to the job opening. But 95 years of advertising results and seven years of my own resume writing experience tell me that interesting facts always outsell vague puffery, no matter what length. Corollary: Two pages is the maximum length I
recommend. You can say a lot in that amount of space. Try to shoot for a mix of 20-30% duties and 70-80% achievements when describing each job. Bad Advice  -- Include your salary and reasons for leaving each job.Never include your salary, and include reasons for leaving in rare cases only. For example, a client of mine was prevented from working in his industry by a legal agreement. Here's how I explained his transition from the seafood business back into computers: "Sold firm at twice original revenue and re-entered high-tech sector upon expiration of three-year non-compete agreement." You can use similar language to explain why you left a job or industry. So, be sure to consider the source
the next time you get a hot tip on resume writing from someone who doesn't do it full-time .... Best of luck to you. Kevin Donlin is President of Guarantee.d Resumes. He is also author of "Resume and Cover Letter Secrets Revealed," a do-it-yourself manual that will help you find a job in 30 days...or your money back. For more info.

Free Industry & Trade Magazine Subscriptions
Make no mistake, staying on top of the news and trends of your industry are an integral part your job search. In fact, according to a recent survey conducted by Beta Research Corporation, on behalf of The New York Times Job Market, the majority of employers (85%) surveyed agree that keeping up-to-date in a candidates field of expertise is a very important tool for conducting a successful job search.So, whether you're looking to move up or to move on, reading business and trade publications can definitely help you move right in to the job of your dreams! For starters, being fluent on the latest trends in your profession can be invaluable while networking or interviewing. These
magazines keep you sharp, well informed, articulate and in-demand.To help you stay current, JobSeeker Weekly has arranged for its readers to instantly subscribe online to practically every leading industry and business publication, at NO COST to you. For more information or to sign up to your industries trade magazines for free, go to Magazine.com.Imagine how being able to make conversation about the latest industry trends and events can be used as an ice breaker while networking. You can stimulate conversation by asking the opinions of others on industry developments -- all the while appearing to be the well read, well informed expert.In fact, the
person with the most power in a conversation is often the facilitator of the conversation -- the one asking questions and opinions of others, listening intently and showing respect for everyone's answers. Beware of taking a position too strongly, being argumentative or coming off like a know-it-all.Your ability to demonstrate keen industry knowledge in conversation helps you project confidence. It also makes an all important yet unspoken statement that you are dedicated and conscientious about your chosen profession -- inspiring others to instinctively feel confident about your skills and abilities. Now that's the position you want to be in while
   networking.Industry trade magazines also provide other wonderful opportunities
for job seekers. The most obvious of which are the industry specific help wanted sections that many have, offering jobs you may not find using traditional job seeking methods.In addition trade publications offer other less obvious opportunities. Their articles can provide wonderful networking leads and the perfect reasons to give them a call. For example, imaging reading an article about a new program that a company is mounting in your area of expertise. And suppose the article also quotes an executive of that company. This gives you the perfect opportunity to call the executive quoted, offer a compliment on the new program and introduce yourself as someone who might be able to help -- or perhaps might be a good addition to their
team. Even if they don't need to fill a position, they may call you in the future or possibly refer you to someone who does.In addition, most industry trade publications list a calendar of events or trade shows that can offer you wonderful networking opportunities. And many of these shows offer free exhibit hall passes just for the asking. The exhibit floor of a trade show is a place where you can meet executives from many the companies in your field -- all in one place.So if you don't regularly read your professions industry trade magazines perhaps now is the time to
   start. JobSeeker Weekly has arranged for it's readers to receive a complimentary subscription to trade publications in practically every leading
industry. It's quick and easy to do. It only takes a minute to search their website and quickly find the magazines matching your skills and interests. You can search by publication title, industry, or geography. Next, pick the magazines you want, fill out a brief online subscription form and press submit. It's that
   easy. For more information or to sign up now for your free trade magazines, Follow this link...

Capitalize On The Hiring Trend
By George Blomgren As I write this, there are a number of indicators that the job marketing is regaining momentum. Employer polls show reasonably strong optimism about hiring in the upcoming months. How do you turn a trend like this to your advantage?Don't take a passive approach - "a rising tide raises all boats." Eventually, if the trend continues, it will make life easier for all job seekers. But initially it will pay off most for those who know how to take advantage of the situation.First, advertised full-time jobs always lag behind rising employment trends. Cautious, busy employers
rarely have all their opportunities advertised. Often, they don't even have the positions entirely defined -- yet another good reason to rely more on networking than any other technique. If you haven't mastered the art of networking, make this the No. 1 priority on your list of career priorities.However you locate job opportunities, approach them vigorously. Research them in advance. Prepare good questions. Make the most of interviews. This is where hiring decisions are made. Send thank-you notes immediately after every interview. If you aren't convinced your interviewing skills are as good as they can be, seek assistance from a career coach.As an employer, we recognize that the "buyers' market" we have faced in hiring is
changing. We will have to be more aggressive in attracting the best candidates. All the more reason you want to be in "the best candidate" category!George Blomgren is an Operations Manager with The Benefit Companies. He provides tips for the job seeker from an employer's point of view.

Want Success?
    Attitude is Everything
Own your own business - Free consultation
If you've ever considered owning your own business, but have been deterred by the horror stories about independent business ownership, then a franchise may be the answer for you. A successful franchise is a network of interdependent business relationships that allows a number of people to share distinct brand identification, a successful method of doing business, and a strong marketing, distribution, and support system. To find out which franchises are available and right for you, we recommend a free consultation with a franchising expert from FranChoice, the "matchmaker" of the franchising industry. They will listen to your concerns and goals, guide you through the search
process and answer all your questions. There's no pressure or obligation to purchase a franchise. To sign up instantly for your free consultation, go to this link.
Successful wealth building strategies
Recently on the Regis Philbin TV show, Robert G. Allen promised he could start with empty pockets and make $24,000 in 24 hours. Did it work? Sort of. He actually made over $94,000. Allen authored two of the best selling financial books in history: "Nothing Down" and "Creating Wealth." Commonly referred to as "America's  Millionaire Maker," Allen's claim to fame is taking ordinary people and successfully teaching them to create multiple streams of major income. His books have sold over 2.5 million copies and over 150,000 people have attended his wealth seminars.Now he's converted his high-dollar seminars into a low-cost digital training course called "Multiple Streams of
Income." This course teaches you all of Robert G. Allen's successful and profitable wealth secrets, proven to work for everyday people living in the United States and Canada, for one very low fee. To visit his website and learn more about this digital course, just follow this link.
Want Success?
     Attitude is Everything
By George BlomgrenTo one extent or another, most of us can agree that our beliefs and attitudes shape our realities. While this is true in every aspect of our lives, I'd like to suggest that it's most apparent and tangible in the realm of employment.What's the essential difference between the employee in the corner office and the one cleaning offices in the evening? (By the way, I'm not implying that either is a better person, but their career status is undeniably different.) The key difference is simply attitude. Each is where they belong, in their own minds. Of course, one office cleaner may be
embarking on a career she knows will ultimately take her to the top, another may be enjoying real job satisfaction, while a third feels demeaned and bored. These too are just attitudes.If you've read my previous articles, you may be saying, "I thought the key to success is education." Or, "You said in your last article that networking was the best path to success." Some would argue that socio-economic background, interviewing skills or confidence are the real fundamental factors.But let's turn these ideas around for a moment. What if all these things are merely "symptoms" of (or indirectly linked to) deep-seated attitudes?What if the woman in the corner office came from a wealthy family -- but it only matters
because it taught her to believe that success is within her reach? What if the CEO has an MBA -- but it is only significant because he's the type of person who tackles anything (such as education) he thinks may help him be more successful?What are your beliefs about success? And, can you do anything to improve them?You're not likely to dramatically alter deep-seated attitudes, but you can influence them. Based on that idea, following are two suggestions that might help you "reprogram" some of your beliefs about success, thereby removing some huge obstacles that exist exclusively in your own mind.Sit down and make a quick list of actions, qualities, and activities that you associate with successful people.
Don't analyze it, just brainstorm. After you have compiled a list, consider what you've come up with. How many items on your list apply to you? If most don't apply, why? Should they? If they are healthy, constructive things, perhaps you should consider making them part of your life. The basic idea here is that, if you want to be successful, act like a successful person.
     For the second activity, you'll need some help. Find someone who can act as a mentor - more of a counselor than a friend. What you're going to do is find the success stories in your life. The successes are there, but many of us don't recognize our own best accomplishments. Stories of adversity, perseverance, perhaps even heroism. At school, at home,
at church, in sports, on the job. One angle to consider is simply big challenges you've faced and overcome. Another part of your past to explore is times you've helped others.
The mentor you've recruited should understand what your goals are. To be helpful, they should "interview" you, probing for more information. With a fresh perspective, they should be able to see success in memories so familiar to you, you may no longer recognize them for what they are. The goal is to make a list of success stories, at least two or three, that you can take pride in. Ideally, they are relevant to an employer. If you're really fortunate, during your next job interview, you may face the question "tell me about a time when you tackled a really big
challenge." Even if they never come up in interviews, though, this exercise may help challenge old beliefs that you aren't successful - by reminding you of important successes you have enjoyed.There is a second important benefit that can occur from this exercise. As you distill your life experiences into highlights - moments of success - you may well learn some things about yourself. Let's say you've worked a lot of jobs in manufacturing. But the list you come up with focuses on times you were able to really help other people. Perhaps you'll agree that, based on this information, you may want to reconsider your career choices.These probably sound like exercises in exaggerated positive thinking and excessive virtue. Really,
they don't have to be. They can be quite the opposite.The most "successful" person I know is quite a jerk. I've known him since he was about 10 years old. He knew back then he wanted money and success and he wouldn't let anything stop him. Over time, he hasn't wavered in his beliefs. (It would be interesting to see the list of "success characteristics" he'd come up with for activity No. 1!) Nor has he let anything get in his way. He's the wealthiest person I know, and it appears to be the inevitable result of his attitudes about success. However, he's also in a lot of trouble with the SEC, and he's on his fourth marriage.So, I suppose one last suggestion worth making is: Choose your beliefs -- and your attitude --
carefully!  George Blomgren is Operations Manager for The Benefit Companies. Drawing on a diverse professional background, George is no stranger to either side of the hiring process. He is involved in a variety of hiring and staffing projects, and is an active career mentor through Milwaukee's AbilITy Connection program.

Locate and Land the Best Jobs Available
By George Blomgren If you are taking a thoughtful approach to your job search, you have probably started to appreciate how networking can help you locate and land the best jobs available. Your network can be an invaluable personal and professional resource throughout your career. The old saying "it isn't what you know, it's who you know" is true, and not in a nepotistic way. In today's information economy, employers are less concerned with your current knowledge/skills than they are with your track record at learning new skills and independently solving problems. One of the most impressive success
stories you can share with an interviewer is how you solved a challenging business problem by working your network.Depending on how you talk about the people you network with, your anecdotes can come across as name-dropping. Here's how to avoid that. Don't tell an interviewer that you often have lunch with John Q. Public, CEO and local celebrity. Instead, tell her a story about how you were able to solve a business problem by utilizing your professional network, including how your relationship with John Q. Public played an essential role in your success.Still not convinced? Consider this: an extensive network of quality people, people with whom you have worked hard to earn a good relationship, can be one of the most
powerful personal PR tools available. They'll be out there every day, mentioning your name and singing your virtues at every suitable opportunity. In contrast, if you have failed to choose the right people and develop a good relationship with them, you will either generate no PR or bad PR.How do you develop the type of network I'm talking about? Here are three general strategies:1. Your network won't grow on its own. Your network may consist of previous colleagues and coworkers, people in your field, members of professional organizations or civic groups to which you belong (now or previously). The key is keeping in touch -- via phone or email or in person.2. Give back more to your network than you take
from it. Proactively work your network: when you talk to a colleague who is out of work, ask how you can help. When you recognize an opportunity for one of your colleagues, reach out and make the connection. Don't just give out names and phone numbers: pick up the phone and make an introduction.3. Conduct your own PR campaigns. Some people consider this over the top, but it can work well. Let's say you are between jobs. Communicate! Create a weekly email update. Initial messages may focus on "here's what I've done/here's what I'm looking for," evolving subsequently into "here's where I've been focusing my job searching energies." Any one of these messages may remind a recipient about an opportunity they can share with
you.Your lifelong networking efforts may be the number one factor in determining your ongoing professional success. And clearly it isn't just a gimmick for opening doors when you need to find a job. In fact, if that's the only time you ever give your network any thought or attention, it won't work well when you need it.George Blomgren is an Operations Manager with The Benefit Companies -- and an expert networker. He networked into his current and previous positions and maintains his network to this day. In his role as a hiring decision-maker, George loves helping job seekers learn successful job-winning strategies.

Follow Your Vocational Passion
By Craig NathansonIt's amazing to me how so many people just accept that they won't be able to do what they really love until they retire. I ask them whether they had considered doing what they love now and then they would never have to retire at all. This of course brings up more emotional pain since many people just accept that retirement is the only time they will ever get to do what they want. I think this is a sad state for our current society. It's a simple equation. Do what you love and you'll never have to work another day in your life. But so many people feel trapped. Sadly, they are
trapped by their own limited thinking. Following your passion is quite possible once you have identified it and decided what your life would be like if you followed it.I should also add that following your passion will have an impact on those around you, especially on your loved ones. Therefore it is equally important to determine how your path will impact them. Open and honest communication can soften the surprise for others when you announce your plans to follow your chosen path. I have a question for you. If you had one entire day to yourself, with no constraints or limitations, how would you spend this day? Go ahead and write down in exquisite detail how this day would go. Use all of your senses. What do you see,
hear, feel, taste and smell as you live out this day? So many of us ignore some of our senses and as a result miss out on important signals from our internal self. Now examine what you have written. Any ideas yet on what might be your passions? Most of us typically will invest time in our areas of interest when we have time to ourselves. By the way, if you come up with an interesting day but none of the activities jump out of you as passions, that's OK.A lot of interesting areas start out as nice things to spend time on but initially don't carry strong emotional feelings. Vocational passion takes practice. Sadly, people practice daily doing more of what they don't want and then wonder why in retirement there's no energy left. Think
about it. A love of painting at age 30, left stagnant until retirement at, say, 65, might be difficult to restart.I am a marathon runner. Let me tell you, virtually no one shows up at the start of a marathon without proper training and completes the entire 26.2 miles. Successfully completing a marathon requires building a strong foundation of daily training combined with very long runs. Following one's passion requires the same kind of discipline and foundation, and most of all, daily practice. Start to carve out some time each day to spend time on what you love. It can take as little as a few minutes a day. The key is doing something each day, which exercises your vocational muscle and most importantly keeps you thinking
about what you prize most.You can start now to follow your vocational passion with daily discipline, practice and a focus on doing more what you love!Craig Nathanson is a professional vocational coach who counsels individuals to discover and live their vocational passion. The preceeding was an excerpt from his book P is For Perfect; Your Perfect Vocational Day.

The Top 12 Job Search Mistakes
By Deborah WalkerStalled in your job-search efforts? Check out this list to make sure you aren't committing some of the worst job-search mistakes. Sending a resume that doesn't set you apart from your competition. Since employers and recruiters read hundreds of resumes a week, you'll catch their attention quicker with a resume that differentiates you from your competition. The best resumes target one career objective which is supported by quantifiable accomplishments relating to corporate bottom-line results. Peppering your resume with relevant accomplishments that emphasize
benefits over features helps the employer see your potential value to their organization. Send an accomplishment-driven resume and keep your calendar clear for the interviews that you'll generate.
Sending "cookie-cutter" cover letters.  Any reader can spot a mass-produced letter. It has as much effect as junk mail - ending up in the "round file." Since your cover letter is most often your first contact with potential employers, it pays to make the most of the opportunity. Effective cover letters are customized and focused on the employer's buying motives. When responding to a job posting, send a cover letter that matches point by point the requirements and qualifications of the job posting. Don't forget
that you'll need different cover letters for different job-search strategies. A letter you send to a headhunter or recruiter will have a different tone and message than the letter you send to a job posting. Letters you send your networking contacts should feel personal - or risk offending the reader. A good cover letter strategy is to create a template for each type of letter you send. Templates reduce the time it takes to customize each letter you send.
Lack of job-search strategy. No plan! Your job search is a sales and marketing campaign. As any marketing guru knows, you get better, faster results with a strategic plan that relies on several marketing channels to deliver your message. A business may use
print ads, radio time and telemarketing to increase sales. An effective job search includes responding to ads, resume distribution to headhunters, networking and target-market resume distribution. If your action plan involves all four strategies you'll find your dream job quicker and more efficiently.
Spending all your job-search energy and time answering want ads and job postings.  Too often job seekers rely on job postings and want ads as the primary source of job leads. Want ads and postings represent only a fraction of job openings available. Since these leads are public knowledge competition is at the highest level. An effective job search campaign also includes uncovering job leads in the hidden
job market.
 Replying to want ads and job postings ineffectively.  In an employers' market (too many job seekers for positions available) it makes sense to apply only to openings that you qualify at least 80%. For these job leads, spend the effort and time to prepare a targeted cover letter. You'll get much higher results sending 10 customized, point-by-point cover letters and resumes than if you respond to 100 ads that you qualify only minimally. Pack your cover letters and resume with key words found in the job postings and, more often, you'll end up on the top of the candidate pile.
 Little or no networking efforts. Not enough proactive efforts. The hidden job market comprises a
big percentage of job leads. These positions are uncovered through networking and other proactive efforts. Networking is simply getting your message out to others that you are interested in learning about new career opportunities. This could mean contacting former colleagues, family members, affiliation or alumni members. The easiest way to get in front of potential employers is on the recommendation of others.Networking requires leaving one's comfort zone to meet new people. Not everyone is gregarious and self confident. What I've learned from my own networking efforts is that it becomes more natural over time. Once a person begins to reap the rewards of networking, the pain of the process is soon
Putting all your eggs in one basket. Job seekers anticipating an offer often stop additional search efforts. They experience disappointment when the offer doesn't come through or the offer fails through poor negotiation. Strategically, this is a bad idea for several reasons. One, it leads to a feeling of "starting over from scratch" which leads to negative and draining emotions. Second, precious time and opportunities are lost. Third, if a second offer is in the works when the anticipated offer materializes, the job seeker is in a much better bargaining position than if he has no other offers to consider.
Lack of interview preparation. Job seekers get better interview results if
they think of it as a sales call. Every great sales presentation starts with pre-sales preparation which includes client research, and product analysis. Job seekers prepare for interviews similarly: research on the prospective employer and a thorough catalog of their own accomplishments to illustrate their potential contribution and value to the employer.Thanks to the internet, company research is relatively easy. Once you've done the research, prepare to communicate your value through your accomplishments. Examine your career for examples of how you have solved problems, saved money, increased revenue, or created revenue opportunities for your former employers. As much as possible, dollarize or quantify your contributions. Do
not depend on your ability to "wing it" through your interviews. Interviewing takes preparation and practice.
Conducting a 24X7 job search. One would never consider accepting a position of employment that required 24-hour, seven days a week attendance. That's an impossible task. Yet many job seekers find it difficult to allow themselves "time off" from thinking about or working on their job search. To get the best productivity out your job-search activities, try to separate your free time from the time you spend on your job search. Think of your job search as if you were running a business. Think of it as MySelf Marketing, Inc. You are the CEO and you get to make up the rules. You can decide how many
hours per day, or day's per week you're going to put in. This may be the only time you get to be the boss, so take advantage of it.
Ineffective headhunter strategy. Headhunters can be a fantastic source of job leads and inside information. To get the most out of potential headhunter relationships there are two rules to follow. First, contact headhunters who specialize in your industry or job function. Most every recruiter or headhunter has a recruiting niche. The second rule, contact as many recruiters as you can who fit your industry or function. The more qualified recruiters you contact, the better your chances of one of them calling you with just the position you're looking for. resume distribution services often provide a shortcut to qualified headhunters and recruiters. They allow you to target headhunters by geography, industry, job function etc. Other resume distribution services will post your resume to all the top career sites and save you hours and hours of data entry. If you are interested in looking into resume distribution services, I recommend you use the following services: ResumeRabbit.com and ResumeMailman.com.
Lack of a back-up plan or plan "B" career objective. Often I hear from frustrated job seekers who have been looking a year or more. Many very talented job seekers are
in the same boat with you. One reason for an extended job search is not having a back up or plan "B" objective. In our current job market you will avoid months of stress by having a back-up or plan "B" career objective.If your situation points to the necessity of forming plan "B", here are a few pointers on deciding the next logical career move. 1) Consider applying the skills and knowledge you already have to use in a growing industry, occupation or location. 2) Look at your skills and knowledge non-work related interests or hobbies. Can you market those skills toward a new career? 3) Consider marketing your current skills in a consulting capacity. 4) Is there a stronger market for positions you've held in the past? 5) What
skills are in high demand? What would it take for you to gain those skills?
Lack of salary negotiation skills. Walking away from $$. Most job seekers understand not to be the first to bring up money or salary requirements. Most also know to avoid stating your price when asked "What starting salary are you looking for?" What most job seekers don't understand is that they must dollarize their worth to the employer long before they reach the bargaining table. Dollarizing your worth by illustrating bottom-line quantifiable accomplishments. A proven history of generating revenue, saving time and money while improving efficiency all contributes to improving net income. Put the effort into proving your worth
and you'll gain bargaining power at salary negotiation time.Deborah Walker, President of Alpha Advantage, Inc., is a nationally respected career coach with extensive experience as a former headhunter and corporate recruiter. Her resume and career advice is featured on more than 3,000 websites and published in professional association newsletters nationwide.

Strategies To Launch Your Job Search
By Wendy S. Enelow Know what you want to do and "who" you want to be. You wouldn't believe the number of people who start their job search and begin sending out resumes when they have no idea what they want to do for a living. If you don't know, then how is anyone else to know? You must be clear about your objectives - type of position, type of company, geographic preference - before you ever begin your search. If you're uncertain about your career goals and job objectives, consider taking a few career assessments that will help you identify your top skills, motivators and career
 Network, network and then network some more. You've heard it said over and over - there is no better way to find a new position then to contact everyone you know. More than 80% of all positions are filled with networking contacts. Are you working your network to your best advantage? And, are you reciprocating? Remember, networking is a two-way street. You do for them and they'll do for
    you.
 Write a powerful, accomplishment-oriented resume. State the facts - written in a hard-hitting presentation that sells your skills, qualifications, contributions and success. If you're ever going to toot your horn own, this is the time! Whether one page or two, it's make no difference as long as your
resume is dynamic and focuses on the value you bring to an organization. Write a general cover letter for each type of position that you are seeking. Then, remember to customize your letter each and every time you use it so that you are responding to the specific needs, qualifications and expectations of each company and/or recruiter you contact. If you use the same cover letter to respond to a sales rep position and a sales management position, then you're not paying attention to each company's needs and not hitting their "hot buttons."
 Prepare an email campaign (resume and cover letter) to send to recruiters and headhunters that specialize in your industry and profession. It is imperative that you select
recruiters who work with candidates like yourself. A sales recruiter is probably not going to place a finance professional. Stay in your "community" of recruiters for the best
    results.
 Respond to help-wanted advertisements in newspapers, trade journals and other publications. The whole world of job search is not dependent on the Internet and online job postings. All too often job seekers forget about the "tried-and-true" strategy of help-wanted ads. Don't you
    forget.
 Practice your interviewing skills. Your ability to interview well can "make or break" you in your job search. As such, be sure that you are well practiced, able to answer tough questions, and effective in communicating your skills and
accomplishments. No matter how talented you are or how well written your resume, if you don't interview well, you won't get offers. If need be, hire an interview coach to be sure that you can nail each and every interview - phone screening, in-person, panel, group or teleconference.
 Know what salary you want. Inevitably, the discussion of your salary requirements will come up during your interviews, hopefully not during your first interview, but closer to when a company is prepared to make you an offer. It is your responsibility to know what salary you can comfortably live with and what salary you will not consider. Of course, there should be some flexibility, but know what you're looking for so that you're not wasting
your time or anyone else's.
 Build your own job search support network. This may include your family, friends, colleagues, mentors and others. Or, you may consider joining a formal job search group in your local area. Most important, don't go it alone. Job search can often be a frustrating experience. If you can build a strong support network, these people will help keep your spirits lifted during the tough times, help you feel and act more confidently, and help move your entire job search along faster and more successfully.Wendy S.

The Likeability Factor: Getting It Right
By Linda MatiasGrowing up we all had a mental picture of the perfect life partner. The person whom we thought would be our happily-ever-after -- a person with a perfect smile, beautiful eyes, and an adorable button nose. Fast forward to reality and who did you wind up with? Chances are that if your partner of choice happens to be male, you ended up with a guy who is shorter than you expected, has less hair than you anticipated, but overall is a pretty neat fellow. And if you're interested in women, chances are that the woman you ended up with isn't as curvaceous as you dreamed, but overall is a very
special person. The truth is that no matter what you envisioned, you bought into what your partner was offering. Although he or she didn't meet all of your set criteria, they met the most important one - they are good people - and that is why you chose their companionship. When it comes to hiring decisions, recruiters aren't any different. Realizing that one candidate isn't going to meet all the criteria in the job description, the recruiter buys into the person as a whole -- not one characteristic, accomplishment or degree. After all is said and done, hiring decisions, for the most part, are based on whether or not the candidate is likeable. What most don't understand is that likeability is more than the knack for
getting others to hang out with you after work and share a couple of beers. This is why most interviews are challenging - not only do you have to demonstrate that you are technically capable of doing the job, you must go a step further and impress the recruiter with your professional makeup (i.e., your ability to be assertive, focused and versatile). Assertiveness: When done right, assertive behavior is a nice balance between self-assurance and cockiness. This attribute can be a driving force during an interview because the person sitting across from you can't help but be drawn towards you, and, therefore, begin to respond to your ideas, thoughts, and words. Coming across as assertive leaves the listener the impression that
you are confident in who you are as a professional and wins you job offers. Focus: Believe it or not, most interviewers dislike going through the motions of hiring, just as much as candidates dislike going on interview after interview. For this reason, a huge part of a successful interview is based on your ability to focus your responses on results. In doing so, you bring clarity to the conversation and help connect the dots for the interviewer. This is an important point because there are times when interviewers don't fully understand how your marketable skills can easily transfer to the open position. When the interviewer begins to buy into your experience, you automatically become more appealing, and in the eyes
of the interviewer, the most qualified candidate. Versatility: Interviewers seek candidates who have a broad perspective and aren't stuck in their way of doing things. Individuals who are versatile are natural born achievers and are recognized for being forward thinking, flexible and resourceful. These attributes interest organizations since the candidates who are adaptable will most likely flourish in any circumstance. Too often, job seekers overlook the likeability factor. The reason? It's always easier to lay the blame on a hiring manager than to take a personal inventory of how you are affecting your job search. Though it is true that sometimes hiring decisions are based on factors beyond your control, there are
occasions when it comes down to whether or not you made a positive first impression.Linda Matias is recognized as a career expert who brings a wealth of experience to the career services field. She has been sought out for her knowledge of the employment market, outplacement, job search strategies, interview preparation, and resume writing. She is president of CareerStrides and the National Resume

By Kevin DonlinToday, I'm going back in history to help you find a job using ... Occam's Razor.Whose what, you ask?William of Occam (1284-1347) was an English philosopher who wrote, "Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily." Put another way, simpler is better. Example: birds could have eight wings or 27, but nature gave them two -- because that's all they need to fly.This principle, which helps us "shave off" those variables or actions not really needed to solve a problem, became known as Occam's Razor.If you're looking for a new job, here are three ways you can use it
to get hired faster.1) Ask to meet the hiring authority -- First, let's state your problem in its simplest terms: to get hired, you must convince an employer that you have the "right stuff" to do the work. That's any job search in a nutshell.Now, what's the simplest way to meet the person who can hire you? Simple! Call them and ask for a meeting.This will be a cold dash of water in the face of most folks, who have been conditioned to believe the path to employment invariably involves writing a resume, submitting it to want ads or Web sites, and then waiting for the phone to ring.Action Step: If you know the company you'd like to work for (and you should) do whatever it takes to meet a hiring authority
there.The best way is to use your network of personal and professional contacts to get the name of the right manager. Go from one person to another, dropping each name as you call, until you get a hiring authority on the phone. Then request a meeting.2) Send your resume once, to many people -- If you must convince an employer that you can do the job, it follows that, the more hiring managers you can "meet" and convince, the faster you'll get hired.That's why, for many folks, a resume distribution service is the simple solution. Why? It lets you send your resume to thousands of employers and recruiters in one fell swoop. Simple.Three resume distribution services to consider are:Resume Mailman: This service will email your resume to as many as 11,914 recruiters, including over 1,552 recruiters who make international placements.JobsByFax: They'll fax your resume directly to 1000's of employers. They have categorized employers into about 73 categories, so you will reach the type of employers you want.Resume Rabbit: With this service, you simply fill out one form that posts your resume on over 75 career sites, like Job.com, Net-Temps, CareerBuilder, FlipDog, and Dice.com.Action Step: Research these and other resume distribution
services to see if they're a match for you. A few minutes here could save you 40 hours or more of tedious effort later.3) Use the interview to prove you can do the job -- Remember, you must prove to a hiring manager that you are qualified for the job. And what better way than to actually do the job, in the interview?This concept is simple. The ways you can pull it off are infinite. Examples:A sales rep could bring a list of 100 potential customers to the interview.
A software developer could talk to employees at the target company to uncover programming problems, then propose solutions.
An editor could review back issues of the company magazine to find proofreading errors, then
mark those errors with Post-it Notes and bring them to the interview.
The examples above are all real. And each resulted in a job offer. How can you adapt them to your situation?Action Step: Use your next interview to actually do the job. While other candidates are learning about the company or asking inane questions, you'll set yourself apart and blow them away. Simple, isn't it?OK. Now that you understand Occam's Razor, answer this question: What's the simplest thing you could do today to get your qualifications in front of the right hiring manager and prove you can do the job?Now, go do
   it!Kevin Donlin is President of
Guarantee.d Resumes. He is also author of "Resume and Cover Letter Secrets Revealed," a do-it-yourself manual that will help you find a job in 30 days...or your money back. For more information, go to: Guaranteed Resumes.
