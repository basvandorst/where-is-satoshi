The problem is the State of Ethics here and abroad, not just in the US but everywhere. Crypto will protect against the effect but will not solve the root cause.

* Eugen Leitl quotes:
Encryption is not a solution to the problem.  The attack on Google
shows that NSA/GCHQ that companies in Western countries and their
employees are legitimate targets for covert operations by their
intelligence services (same for the BND attacks on 1&1 and other
German ISPs, we don't have to single out the Obama administration or
the British here).  Once that is established, those intelligence
services can use all the tools in their portfolio.  This includes
turning employees against their colleagues and their employer, and
things far worse.  Suddenly, passive eavesdropping might not have been
so bad after all.
If you are their target, you lose.  The solution is to make it illegal
that they target you, reign in executive privilege (again, a global
issue) and restore the rule of law.  Obviously, that's a bit more
difficult to turn on some crypto.

Just who did he commit the crime against, both MIT and JSTOR wanted prosecution dropped.
In your example "your house" represents both MIT and JSTOR.
The rest of your argument makes me think your either a deciple of Authority or here to troll, or both.

Github already did, but the torrent is everywhere already.

I would have thought this list of all places would know and understand 4chan/pol. And recognized the garbage phrase alt-right for what it was.
