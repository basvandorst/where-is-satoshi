::This all seems to be noobie stuff. There's nothing technically cool ::to see here
You mean the report or the activity?
You seem "upset" that they are using M$ only(target and source). They steal data!!! From whom to steal? From a guru that spend minimum 8 hours a day in from of *nix? Why to put so much effort to steal information from that guy, when there are thousands of people out there with vulnerable and easy to break M$.
They aren't looking to do something cool, but just a regular, plain old thief stuff.  Targeting M$ users if easy, involve less resources and it's "business" profitable. You need to look at this action from business perspective.
IMO, why to spend hours to break something (like *nix systems) that you don't even know if it contains valuable information. This is more like sniffing around to find something useful and not targeting exact system.
Somebody here mentioned that this unit is not their top unit. I'm sure that it's not. Maybe it was meant to be found. ---- On Thu, 21 Feb 2013 01:29:48 +0100 Scott Weeks  wrote ----

It was just an example :-) to point out the scale of  developers vs operators.

As Warren mention, if you have 20 "brains" it's easy to put those people port  a tool from *nix to other platform and have the other 500 operators run it in windows. It's just a matter of good sense and "business" effectiveness :)

No matter how much I like CLI and to put my fingers into text mode, I have to admit that point and click in windows is an easier and faster method to achieve the task I did mention.

Maybe I misinterpret information, but this is how I see things.

If I didn't miss any part of the report, no *nix is mentioned.
I'm a *nix fan, but why they (when I say they, I mean an attacker, not necessary the one in this document) should complicate their life, when all tools are available for windows os, you just have to compile them.
