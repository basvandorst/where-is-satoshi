A teacher said to her class:"Who was the first man?"George Washington," a
little boy shouted promptly."How do you make out that George Washington was
the first man?" asked the teacher, smiling indulgently."Because, " said the
little boy, "he was first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of
his countrymen."But at this point a larger boy held up his hand."Well," said
the teacher to him, "who do you think was the first man?""I don't know what
his name was," said the larger boy, "but I know it wasn't George Washington,
ma'am, because the history book says George Washington married a widow, so,
of course, there must have been a man ahead of him."
Three tourists climbed up the tower with London's Big Ben and decided to
throw their watches off the top, run down the stairs and try to catch them
before they hit the ground. The first tourist threw his watch but heard it
crash before the had taken three steps. the second threw his watch and made
only tow steps before hearing his watch shatter . The third tourist threw
his watch off the tower, went down the stairs, bought a snack at a shop up
the street and walked slowly back to Big Ben in time to catch the watch."
How did you do that?" asked one of his friends. " My watch is 30 minutes
slow." he explained.
