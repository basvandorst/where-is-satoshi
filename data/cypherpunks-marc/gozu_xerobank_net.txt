Arguably, the prudent threat model is that the Zetas will kill you if
they learn that you're using Tor.  They can access available resources
for finding bridge addresses .
And they may have connection logs, so provisional obscurity isn't

Assume that the Zetas have full admin access for all local and regional
ISPs in the areas that they control.  Also assume that they know Tor
very well, run relays, and routinely communicate through it.
How safe would it be, in those areas, to access Tor through bridges?

Responding to criticism about cooperating with the US investigation of
LulzSec, HideMyAss said: "Regarding censorship bypassing, some have
stated it is hypocritical for us to claim we do not allow illegal
activity, and then claim our service is used in some countries to bypass
censorship illegally. Again we follow UK law, there isn=92t a law that
prohibits the use of Egyptians gaining access to blocked websites such
as Twitter, even if there is one in Egypt =85 though there are certainly
laws regarding the hacking of government and corporate systems."  See
One precaution might be to choose VPN services in jurisdictions
unfriendly to your own.  Perhaps Russian VPN services would more likely
cooperate with Syria?  Would US ones be less likely?

Anonymous server rental is nontrivial.  What degree of non-attachment is
sufficient, in your opinion?

That's good news.
So, naif, what got you stirred up about this, if I may ask?

I trust that all with strong opinions on this issue are at least
somewhat familiar with recent work by Eric Filiol's group.
