Zeroed is.
How about random works in freebsd? and what is entropy accumulators? and what is yarrow, and what is the period of yarrow algorithm? I think that you should be talking about old-fashion 2^32 period algorithms (4GB, and really 16Gb taking 32-bit numbers)... or maybe 2^56 And... do you know, that disk will be filled with information randomly that will be deleted inside the crypto, and wont be reflected outside and wont be replaced with urandom again? (Eventually you will have "all disk filled with encryption" with a very low amount of urandom generated bytes)
And when you fill the harddrive with your info, the urandom/random sprng generated chunks, each one, will be more cryptographically strongest that a big hard-drive without chunks.  The number of chunks depends on your filesystem If you need more strong and avoid entropy acummulation order proof on the hard-drive, you can use a very useful method:
Fill all your drive with 1, then fill with 0, then:
Separate your disk in blocks, make a bitmap, then feed the yarrow SPRNG with real random data (Proccesses, CPU cycles, CPU temperature, past info, your files, etc..), take a n-bit integer from yarrow sprng to determine what block will be filled, take a block from the sprng and put on the random location, mark this as used on the bitmap, and follow the same steps until the drive are filled. With this method you cannot see the difference of entropy on entire disk, mixed with AES-256 (Or serpent-256) crypto dispersed on that, you will have a The chunks/blocks will be sufficiently shortest not to make a high precision entropy calculations.
Since opensource bring you a chance, you can reimplement your yarrow sprng to use Serpent-256 (more strong if you need).
With sufficient error if the PRNG are really a SPRNG (Freebsd implements a strongest version of Yarrow-160, a Yarrow-256)
But this is rocket science for mortals, even if you prove this evidence, the "encrypted container" could be an encrypted swap that commonly have a random password initialized on every boot and not known by the user. This will look same as you describe evidence: Chunks of bad-random mixed with encrypted data started from an USB or SD drive.
Then, since there are feasible scenarios with this set up, your evidence could be sufficient for the presentation but never determinant.
Not really, as i mentioned above... I can use my drive in two legitm ways:
- Encrypted BIG swap that use random password every boot.
- cat /dev/urandom if i need to sell it.
And i can use a "live cd" or something like DSL (D. Small Linux), a pendrive booteable linux. Think that i can use DSL (D. Small Linux) from my SD Card, then, if i want, my HD will be used to be a big encrypted swap. Encrypted swap are commonly setted with different random password on every boot.
Can you request for random password on swap? Many systems have the option of encrypted swap with random password on every boot, like LUKS. There are legitim that i have an random-password initialized SWAP? or should be removed from LUKS... and from ubuntu, fedora, debian, etc?
Even if you prove the boot from external device, you could get this system of DSL or something booting on your SD, and are legitim systems.
Thats a true. but sd card meant to be out of reach.
Yes, im not a lawyer. A lawyer will suggest you say the true. This is a true. Studying many cases, the true are statistically proven to be the best choice. Or not mr Craig?
This method should not be used against laws. But there are too many situations _not judges_ on that will be very useful.

In a judge, you have to divulge the key. I think that when you are honest, you will have some benefits that can help you. But as i mentioned above, this method were not designed for a simple judge. This may not happen in your country, but In kidnapping, extortion and commando stealing are wide spreaded in some countries. In such situations, honesty doesnt help you. You have to protect yours without the option of doubt or under torture effects. And the best method to avoid torture, is hiding the crypto. In my country, there are more than a hundred of such kidnapping cases every year.
Read: In some cases, the commandos stealed computers with finantial databases to commit more kidnapps based on a "best profit objetives".
We are thinking on laws, and how the law are circumvented... dont fear the law, say the true.

That's the point.
In laws, there are two sides:
- defendant
- accuser
Every side will take sides (redundant), and every side know (based in facts and statistics) how to incriminate or defend.
The defendant will try to minimize the sentence. not to embarrase himself with information. And a lawyer is the best player on this game, choosing what is best for his client. We cannot take real sides as writers... (Is not my job). We have to put everything on the table, and accept a reasonable disccusion.
You are taking asumption that this "random data" are evidence. In a judge, you need to prove that. And... evidence are evidence since a criminal act was commited, not before. Then, we (all of us) can "cat /dev/urandom > /dev/sda" anytime without worry about "evidence destruction" if we are not in a court acussed of anything and we didnt anything bad.
Legally, the only proof of your point are the destruction of the MicroSD after the raid... But again, you need to prove that this microSD card was destroyed after the raid, because it's not considered evidence before...
BTW... Some Info:
Some cryptos, like LUKS (Included in many linux distributions), have a "visible encryption header"... Some cryptos like ncrypt or cryptoloop not, and are statistically random data.
You need to prove that is not random data. "Presumption of innocence, base of modern democracy, amendments: 5th 6th 14th "
Otherwise, every picture on your harddrive can be taken as unaccessable evidence, with a proof on stegano... (Today, steganography can mask bytes on pictures, sometimes without leading a real proof of existence, sometimes looks like a real picture with a very low noise, hand-move, or camera effect, and good stegano systems have countermeasures for statistically analisis). How do you prove that your camera noise or picture hand-move are random?
The responce is: Presumption of innocence, the judge need to prove that the defendant hide data on this file. Only if you are inoccent or your charges are not so bad. Im only trying to show that this problem is more complex that we know, those cryptosystems where designed for stress situations, more hard than a simple judge, where you only have to loose n years of your life without torture or  In other situations, many times out of your country, those two-factor and other technologies on cryptosystems save lives and make heroes.
Other cryptosystems where only designed to protect my data from my wife...
In a democratic world, judges with crypto and computer obtained information are more complex that we think. Sometimes are too easy for the judge, when you buy pgp and pgp installs a bootstrap saying: HELLO, THERE IS A PGP INSTALLED SYSTEM... (loudly)... But sometimes we are treating with steganography, sometimes with files that looks as random data, sometimes with foreing servers, sometimes there is not so easy for the judge...
Taking the side of accuser... Our job as security or forensic speccialist is not to say: oh, random data, looks like encrypted data. (That is a mediocre analysis)
Our job is to find with statistics, the probability that this random data are encrypted data. Some bad cryptosystems will lead flaw to us to detect that, like cryptofiles not initialized (will look as chunks of random data mixed with zeroes...), or bad cypher algorithm (Will look as diferent noise type that random data), or a header signature that reveals that there are an encrypted This info, mixed with a good detective work, can correlate scenarios (like a microsd card fire-burned), with your probability analysis, increasing or decreasing the probability to be innocent or guilty of every charge.
Forensics analysis will say if the microsd was burned after or before the judge...

two factor authentication with micro-sd memory card that you preserve all the time with you, and can be eated when you feel angry, or can be incinerated if you smoke it on a cigar, or simply drop it. this sd memory card will contain bootstrap and encrypted key for two-factor cypher.  (Over 200 celsius degrees!!!)
Then, the hardrive will only contain: RANDOM DATA.
This is plausible?, this could be insulting for the judge, but, you must allegate that before the raid, you do an "cat /dev/urandom > /dev/sda1" for a mantainance pourporse from a live cd... (i really didit before sell my harddrive to prevent credit card and other private info leakeage).
Look at: This is plausible. You didn't consider your hard-drive as evidence before the judge starts, because you never didit anything barely legal.
Another plaussible act are say that this 8Gb partition are an encrypted swap used by a secure live cd that you use. (There is to know that encrypted swap uses a random key and looks like random data). You can have the secure live cd and demostrate how it works.

Not at all.
In a forensic analisys, the first rule is make a copycat from drive before open it for analisys. (Sometimes two copycats...)
Then you will military format a copy, not the original evidence and other's copy's. This could be taken as "Intentional destruction of evidence". Not so useful specially when the judge have another copy of your drive.
What if your OS is WinXP 32-bit with IE8? hypothetic population estimation in percentage: ~21%.
Then: ~0.21*0.05 = 0.01 (About ~99% that is your computer)
