[[various possible uses of Bitcoin et al]]
In the modern world, no major government wants to allow untracable
international financial transactions above some fairly modest size
thresholds.  (The usual catch-phrases are things like "laundering
drug money", "tax evasion", and/or "financing terrorist groups".)
To this end, electronic financial transactions are currently monitored
by various governments & their agencies, and any but the smallest of
transactions now come with various ID requirements for the humans
on each end.
But if each machine in a million-node botnet sends 10 cents to a
randomly chosen machine in another botnet on the other side of the
world, you've just moved $100K, in a way that seems very hard to
trace.  To me, this means that no major government is likely to allow
Bitcoin in its present form to operate on a large scale.
I also worry about other "domestic" ways nasty people could exploit
a widespread Bitcoin deployment:
* Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters
  trivially (as usual, the costs would fall on people other than the
  botnet herders & spammers).
* If each machine in a botnet sends 1 cent to a herder, that can add
  up to a significant amount of money.  In other words, Bitcoin would
  make botnet herding and the assorted malware industry even more
  profitable than it already is.
Is there something obvious I've missed?  Is there a clever aspect of
the design which prevents botnets from exploiting the system?  Is there
a way for every major government to monitor all Bitcoin transactions
to watch for botnet-to-botnet sending?

There are other alternatives as well:
* Alice says "Yes, I clicked the 'sign' button, but the document on my
  screen didn't say 'transfer all my money to Bob', it said 'transfer
  my next month's rent to $landlord'.  Hmm, just as I was clicking the
  'sign' button a bunch of stuff flashed up on the screen for a fraction
  of a second, then went away before I could read it.  That kind of thing
  happens a lot with my computer these days.  It's really irritating,
  isn't it?  But on the positive side, look at these cute dancing bunnies
  I downloaded a few weeks ago."
* Alice says "Hey, Bob, I just noticed that you have a digital nature
  from me. Well, ummm, I didn't do it. I have no idea how that could have
  happened, but it wasn't me.  I don't even know what a digital signature
  is, so I'm really really doubtful that I ever did one.  Hey, look at
  these cute dancing bunnies  I downloaded a few weeks ago."
In practice, a digital signature establishes a binding between some piece of software which knows Alice's private key, and some bit-string
(a "document").  But the legal system wants a binding to Alice's conscious
intent, which is a *very* different thing.

[[for attacking bitcoin]]
It's pretty easy for the botnet to monitor for human activity (e.g.,
mouse movement, non-screensaver processes running) and suspend their
activity then.  Since the computer is likely idle most of the time
(I'm assuming bonets mainly use home computers, which will be idle
when their owners are sleeping, and usually when owners are out
at school/work/shopping/etc in the daytime), the botnet throughput
is only modestly degraded.

The implicit assumptions here, namely that

There are good reasons for financial systems (including the crypto
which might underlie them) to allow offline transactions.
[Another key bitcoin flaw is that it's not particularly anonymous
in the face of NSA-level network surveillance.  Cash *is* (remains)
under these conditions.]

The problem with this scenario is that it very quickly degenerates into
rule-by-spammers-and-the-Russian-Mafia.  As Henry Spencer put it in a
classic usenet posting from July 2000,
# When there is no law and an abundance of armed
# individuals, the fast gun is king, especially if he's a psychopath who
# can't imagine his own death.  That means you do what he tells you, swallow
# his insults, and step off into the mud when he wants to use the sidewalk.
# # Actually, no, I have to retract that.  The real king is the gang lord,
# because when there is no social structure to provide safety, people do not
# exist as polite independent individuals in an environment of mutual
# respect -- they *make* a social structure to provide safety.  The trouble
# is, when they're driven to do that, trivia like freedom, due process of
# law, etc. tend to get second priority.  The gang lord (ranch owner, mine
# boss, whatever) can do whatever he wants, and his lieutenants and gunmen
# have almost as much freedom, but his lesser retainers are almost slaves,
# and anyone he dislikes is likely to end up dead.  For example, if he's a
# free-range rancher, independent sheep farmers who try to fence in the open
# range tend to end up dead in a ditch for the crime of putting up fences on
# their own land.  (This happened quite a bit in western frontier America.)
To return to something vaguely relevent to this mailing list, substitute
"use good crypto" or "try to run a RBL listing major spammers" for "fence
in the open range" in that last passage. :)
Larry Niven's short story "Cloak of Anarchy"
also seems relevant here.

This is confusing two somewhat different things:
Radio noise emitted by spark plugs is way too small to bother 99% of
other electronic equipment (including other computing equipment).  And
I don't think the NSA is worried about secret information being leaked
out via spark-plug radio emissions because the generator doesn't have
access to any secrets.  (I.e., the only information leaked would be that
the generator is running & its RPM (& maybe concievably the make/model
if inferrable from timing patterns), none of which seems particularly
In contrast, astronomers are looking for *very* tiny signals which
may well be drowned out by (e.g.) spark-plug noise, so
(a) radio telescopes use *very* sensitive low-noise radio receivers, and
(b) radio telescopes tend to be located in valleys so the terrain shields
    them from many human-made sources of radio noise,
(c) banning spark plugs (and electric razors and many other sources of
    low-level radio noise) near radio telescopes makes sense
It wouldn't surprise me if digital-camera CCD readouts radiated
radio signals just like (e.g.) flat-panel display screens, and that
the NSA could harvest these.  So... if someone takes a digital-camera
picture of secret information, a nearby radio receiver could pick up
enough signal to reconstruct the picture.
I'm sure the NSA tries to rule out leakage of this sort by the same
sort of anti-Tempest guidelines (e.g., radio shielding, trying to
enforce a no-spies-nearby "quarantine zone" around secure facilities)
as for other compromising radio emissions.  Not to mention that cameras
are often forbidden in secure facilities anyway.....

Two other contemporary-use-of-cheques notes:
* BC Hydro, the main electricity utility in the province of
  British Columbia, Canada, does not currently offer online payments.
  (I think they'll allow you to use a 3rd-party online payment system,
  who of course charges a fee for that "privilege", quite apart from
  any security issues.)  So, I mail a paper cheque to BC Hydro every
  2 months to pay my electricity bill.
* Typical international wire-transfer fees between (say) the USA and
  Canada are around $50-$75 per transfer.  Depending on your financial
  institution's fee schedule and exchange-rate policies, mailing a paper
  cheque can be significantly cheaper than an international wire transfer.

Dave Eggers' novel "The Circle" (hardcover: McSweeney's and Knopf,
2013; paperback: Vintage, 2014) is a brilliant exploration of how
such a surveillance society could be created -- with superficially
benign intent -- by social networking run amok.  I highly recommend
the novel.
