Since we keep coming back to FreeBSD as it pertains to security:
 3) FreeBSD is very mature, and very well reviewed.  I've looked into
FreeBSD is not the distribution in the BSD

best known for
Indeed OpenBSD has a specific focus on security

the relationship between the
but FreeBSD focuses on being more inclusive of a variety of hardware at a
cost of not being 100% open source.
That is a tradeoff, but it does not mean that FreeBSD is not secure, it
just means ... well I have not found a study about that yet.

I do not know of any prosecution for using a Warrant Canary, but that does
not change whether the government would intend to prosecute it (and I have
discussed it with lawyers in the DoJ and other areas). It just means that
the situation has not come up: either because no place that uses a Warrant
Canary has received a "secret order" or because no place that has received
one has been willing to really use it as designed. This is what it boils
down to: Do you want to go in front of a federal judge and say "I did not
say we received a subpoena, I just stopped saying we did not receive one."?
I know I would not want to.
If anyone wants to talk more about Warrant Canaries, email me off the list.

Probably would not work (or would get whoever did that thrown in jail).
This is similar to a Warrant Canary, but the USDoJ has indicated that
Warrant Canaries would probably be grounds for prosecution of violation of
the non-disclosure order.
