Many third party vendors like Adobe, Sun and others are just as culpable in this sense, if not more.  A large majority of the vulnerabilities leveraged to deploy modern malware / botnets come from these client-side applications (e.g. flash, reader, java, etc) and not the OS specifically.  It's beyond the point that we can blame just Microsoft.  Yes, they can get better, but they've actually made great strides in software security in the last few years.  Now that the other vendors are starting to feel the pain, hopefully they'll start to follow suit.
