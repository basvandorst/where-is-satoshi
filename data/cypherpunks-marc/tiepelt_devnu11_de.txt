well thanks for reply :)
The key exchange does not rely on using two different points.
I will try to explain i little more general:
I generate my l-torsion subgroup by two points:
 = E[l]
During Key exchange i define my kernel using linear combination of
random values:
m, n
kernel = [m] * P + [n] * Q
So i wondered why i need two points. To generate the torsion subgroup it
would suffice to use one point:
 = E[l]
And to generate the kernel the linear combination of one points would
suffice too:
kernel = [m] * P
So why is the protocol using zwo points for each? I that purely a
security issue to ensure that the torsion subgroup is no cyclic anymore?

taken the key exchange protocol De Feo, Jao and Plot in
The public parameter are:
Elliptic curve E over finite field F_q, Torsion subgroup  =
E[l_A] of E(F_q)
The Parameter for the key exchange for Alice are:
two random numbers m_A, n_A to compute the isogeny with kernel:
K_A := [m_A] P_A + [n_A] Q_A
So my question is, why do i need to random values m_A and n_A to compute
the torsiongroup E[l_A] and respectively the kernel K_A ?
Why does is not suffice to use only 1 point to generate E[l_A] and
Kernel K_A ?
