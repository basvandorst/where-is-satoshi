Joke Of The Day A guy is driving across country trying to get home for Christmas. As he passes through Mississippi he sees a Nativity Pageant and notices the three wise men are dressed as firemen.
He stops and asks, "Hey--why are you guys dressed up like that?" to which the biggest bubba replies, "You yankees sure are dumb. It says right here in the song that three strangers came from afar."
Joke Of The Day One night, a little blind boy's mother said to him, "Anthony, if you pray really, REALLY hard tonight, when the sun rises tomorrow you will be able to see!" Needless to say, Anthony prays up a storm! Morning came and Anthony is still blind.
He starts crying and his mom rushes in. She gasps, "Anthony, what's wrong?"
Anthony wails, "Mommy, I prayed so hard but I'm still blind!" His Mom gently pats him on the head. "I know, honey. April Fools!"
