The resulting products offer the nutritional benefits of         “veggie burgers” but with the taste and texture of real meat.         These are the first meat products to carry the soy cardiovascular claim:         “25 grams of soy protein a day as part of a diet low in fat and cholesterol         may reduce the risk of heart disease.”
