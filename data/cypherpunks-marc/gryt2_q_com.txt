You can install the pulseaudio volume control (pavuctl?).  In that
control you can disable one of the devices in the configuration tab and
then alsa has it.
Gnome: Applications -> Sound and Video -> Mixers -> pulse audio volume
Set a device to off, pulseaudio will ignore it from then on.
You have to access it in alsamixer using the card option,
alsamixer -c
