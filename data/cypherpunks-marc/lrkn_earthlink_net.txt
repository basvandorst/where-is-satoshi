The "effectively" is used to make the law "effectively" vague and confusing
like the ECPA. This means the prosecutor can convict you of anything.
A guy in Tulsa was tried and convicted in federal court on 27 counts under the ECPA. The judge studied the law for months before sentencing and
finally overturned all counts on the grounds the defendant had not violated
the law. If judges have difficulty understanding laws, we have no chance.
BTW, IANAL and this is from news reports, I haven't found the actual ruling.
