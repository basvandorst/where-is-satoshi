Greetings all,
After a near-nine year run (since downloading the Marist distro back in
April(?) 2000), 3M shut down the last two IFLs last week. At one time we
had over 75 virtual servers running, including numerous DB2Connect servers,
five TSM servers, the reverse proxy servers front-ending all digital media
content on 3M.com, WebSphere development servers, and various "odds and
ends"-type low use servers.
It was a blast while it lasted. I had the good fortune to be able to work
with nearly all the cool technologies developed in recent z/VM releases -
virtual switches (VLAN-aware and unaware), guest LANs, hipersockets
(virtual and real), FCP (tape), and more.
I have so many people to thank for all their hard work, from all the folks
in development who brought this marvelous technology to us, to so many of
you contributing to this list day-in and day-out, and especially to all
those who have helped me personally with zLinux issues over the years.
I'll be dropping into lurk mode on this list for now, but hopefully you'll
continue to see me from time to time on VMESA-L, IBM-MAIN, and others.
Very best regards,
Mark Wheeler
