I shouldn't have to point this out, but if you can't buy it (or steal it from
someone who has bought it), it ain't available. The military *is supposed* to have 300K doses by the end of the calendar
year, but the contract (IIRC) actually calls for delivery by end of FY 2003.
Besides, 300K doses is significantly less than the number of active-duty
military folks, much less civilians (or even civilian gov't officials) in
likely target areas.
The military is set to have 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine by the end of
this year.  Should we be vaccinated?  I was vaccinated as a child, but most
of us who have been vaccinated are no longer immune.  In the event that a
terrorist decides to covertly unleash smallpox, we would all be at risk, as
we would be the front line of defense.  Any thoughts from the list?  The
first wave of ill people from a smallpox attack could also take out the
healthcare system, as we are not immune, and may not recognize the early
cases.  Just thinking "out loud" here.

HNC made their nut selling neural networks to a variety of friendly
neighborhood TLAs and credit-card issuers. I suspect that their "new"
software is just a neural network trained with surveillance and ticketing
data. Hardly new.

I'm dubious about the "anonymous mathematical algorithms that cannot be
reverse engineered" part, and I'm skeptical about the "we're gonna cork
up the mind of God and bottle it for those worthy/rich enough to afford
it" aspect. Sounds like snake oil to me.
Data mining, pattern-recognition, AI, ubiquitous surveillance, etc. are
just tools. The biggest danger, beyond flawed premises in the code, such as, for instance, ignoring second-order and higher observer loop effects,
or  beyond willful misuse, is GIGO. The central issues are still political, anyway. None of this matters if I'm not bothering you and you
come fuck with me, in other words. And, hey, two can play the same game. Thank you, Mr. Felsenstein, et al.
Choate, feel free to forward to psychohistory.

Someone's conflated the B61-11 with the GBU-28.
The B61-11, referred to in the FAS article, is an air-delivered tactical
nuclear weapon with selectable yield. Getting it 15ft underground would
probably do the trick.
The GBU-28 is basically a 155mm artillery barrel packed full of explosives.
Well, OK, not really, but that's what the first set of GBU-28s used in Gulf
War I were. Slap some guidance fins and a standard LGB kit on it, and voila!
The hardened steel of the barrel makes for a dandy ground penetrator.
The larger 1945 version of the Tallboy, called the Grand Slam, supposedly
penetrated over 7 metres of concrete when used in action - but it did weigh
ten tons & hit the ground at twice the speed of sound. Apparently the shock
of the impact did as much damage as the explosion, causing structures to
break up up to hundreds of metres away, literally an "earthquake bomb".
Of course it is always possible that Dr. Strangelove is still in the employ
of the US military and that some insane looney  with a grudge against sheep
does want to use nukes. Sensible arguments about the idiocy of developing new
exploding nukes can be found all over the web - the first google hit on
B61-11 is  and worth reading. FAS, as
always, has heaps of stuff.
