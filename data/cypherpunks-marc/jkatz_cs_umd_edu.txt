I'm not sure what is the motivation for all this. Shamir's scheme is supposed to be done over a finite field (or else, as was previously pointed out, there are issues with sampling a uniform element of the field). Since we have fields of size 2^k for all k, any bit-string can be encoded nicely in a finite field of appropriate size. (And very long strings can be broken into shorter chunks, each chunk being shared on its

The scheme is defined over a finite field *not* over the integers. When Shamir's scheme is run over a finite field, it is information theoretically secure.

Not so; this is most easily seen by taking the uniform distribution over
n-bit messages, in which case the entropy is n and the redundancy is 0.

I'm not sure why this was news in 1961; Shannon had this observation a
decade earlier and the one-time pad predates that.
"Every cipher is breakable, given enough traffic": in principle, yes, as
long as the traffic (formally, the entropy of the traffic) is larger than
the keylength.
"Every cipher is unbreakable, if the traffic volume is restricted enough":
not true; the cipher that ignores the key and outputs the message in the
clear is not secure for any non-zero traffic. On the other hand, the
one-time pad is secure as long as the traffic is less than the keylength.
