An individual can't, and people in general can't over the short term,
but is it really true that we can't at all over the medium to long term?
It seems to me there's a variant of Barnum's (apocryphal?) quote here,
about fooling all the people all the time.  I'm far less worried about
my own privacy than I am about a culture of surveillance, and for that
I'm not really concerned about having absolute trust in my own hardware
and software.[1]  What I want is a likelihood that approaches certainty
over time that if something is being done it will be discovered, and
ideally the culprit will be outed as well.
Make it difficult/expensive enough to do, and the cost high enough to
potential surveillers, and I think we've achieved the bulk of what we

You have this exactly backwards, imo.  Neither my daughter nor I are
under any particular _personal_ threat from tracking.  In that sense I
sympathize with people who say "Who the f** cares?" about tracking,
targeted ads, and so on.
The mistake they make is the same as the one you're making.  They fail
to appreciate that these things shape our culture.  Even if (hopefully)
my daughter has enough self esteem and personal strength not to be
affected by these ads, she's still living in a culture that they're
