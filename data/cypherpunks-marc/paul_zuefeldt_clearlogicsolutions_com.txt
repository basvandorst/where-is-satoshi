I wasn't suggesting the authorities have access to your vote. The role of
the authorities is to provide the polling/vote-verification facility and to
enforce physical security.  You would keep your receipt private, using it
for two purposes: 1. To unlock a voter registration record to be used by the
authorities to verify your physical credentials.
2. Having been verified as the true owner of the receipt, to allow you to
view your vote detail in private.

Maybe the receipt should only allow the voter to check that his vote has
been counted. To get the detail you could require him to appear in person
with his receipt AND a photo ID or some such, then only allow him to view
his detail -- not print it.

Except to those of us who don't trust the system.
Implemented correctly it could be cheap and complications could be
hidden from the voter. It could be cheaper - no need to pay people to do
an audit when "the people" will do it for you. You only need a small
fraction of "the people" to verify their votes to get a high level of
confidence that the election is valid. You only need one failure to cast
doubt on the election. This requires an un-forgeable receipt that cannot
be used for coercion. Un-forgeable we have been doing for a while now
with lots of different PK options. A receipt that cannot be used for
coercion cannot give any indication to others of who you voted for.
Right now this is a big complication (at least to me - I don't know how
to create such a receipt that doesn't require mental gymnastics on the
part of the voter).
