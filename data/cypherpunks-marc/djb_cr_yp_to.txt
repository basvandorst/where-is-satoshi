Cryptographers are certainly not responsible for this superstitious
nonsense. Think about this for a moment: whoever wrote the /dev/random
manual page seems to simultaneously believe that
   (1) we can't figure out how to deterministically expand one 256-bit
       /dev/random output into an endless stream of unpredictable keys
       (this is what we need from urandom), but
   (2) we _can_ figure out how to use a single key to safely encrypt
       many messages (this is what we need from SSL, PGP, etc.).
For a cryptographer this doesn't even pass the laugh test.
I'm not saying that /dev/urandom has a perfect API. It's disappointingly
common for vendors to deploy devices where the randomness pool has never
been initialized; BSD /dev/urandom catches this configuration bug by
blocking, but Linux /dev/urandom (unlike Linux /dev/random) spews
predictable data, causing (e.g.) the widespread RSA security failures
documented on  But fixing this configuration bug
has nothing to do with the /dev/random superstitions.

Peter Gutmann writes (on one of the harder-to-use mailing lists):
Actually, the Brainpool curves _meet_ the rigidity requirement that
you're alluding to. The SafeCurves site displays this in the summary
table (bottom of  and in the detailed
rigidity analysis (
What's confusing you, apparently, is the distinction between "fully
rigid" and "somewhat rigid". The question here is quantitative and
objective: how many different curves could have been generated within
the limits imposed by the curve-generation method?
Brainpool, in particular, generated curves using a method with _some_
details that are not explained anywhere in the Brainpool documents. This
structure gave _some_ unnecessary power to the people who chose those
details. If those people had (for whatever reason) secretly decided to
target a one-in-a-million type of curve, they would have been able to do
so by varying these details. The general public has no way to verify
that this didn't happen.
Something else that might be confusing you is the gap between what's
absolutely known to be required for security and what conservative
cryptographers recommend. For example, ECC standards prohibit small
discriminants merely to eliminate a potential source of concern---not to
stop any actual attacks. Similarly, the SafeCurves site describes a lack
of rigidity as a "potential lack of assurance" in a "corner case"---not
as something that's actually known to allow attacks.
I'm not aware of any dispute regarding any of this, so I don't know why
you describe it as "subjective". Perhaps you should read more carefully
through what the SafeCurves site actually says.
