You should make a copy of the post office to a new location prior to the purge.  Then login with a /ph- switch pointing to your dummy location.  Have your user archive anything he needs, and then get out of GroupWise.  Go back to the real post office and unarchive.
Of course, this brings up a VERY good point about Y2K testing.  Don't go into ANY programs that are scheduling in nature when you move your clock forward, or you risk losing a lot of information.  Not just in GroupWise, but anything that does any kind of date sensitve purging.
What is the procedure for restoring a person's e-mail what has happened
was the user set the date of his computer to year 2000 for testing, but
since there was a 60 day purge of all e-mail the user lost all of his
e-mail, what files do I need to restore, to get the users e-mail back
from tape.
