In Italy, a law (well, not exactly, a decree by the telecommunication
authority, AGCOM) about an IP blacklist for file sharing websites is
being discussed. A final decision was supposed to be made in July, but
was finally delayed, probably till next November. Some links in English
that discuss it:
Because of this, many links and short guides to Tor are being posted
around, mostly by inexperienced users that do not warn about the
potential security problems, and are in generally quite misleading as to
what Tor actually is and how it works. In this context, the idea that an
unofficial, and apparently badly built Tor bundle might be out there
only makes sense.

You clearly do not understand the general procedure stated in European
crime laws. In most EU countries, the police cannot arrest you, after
being charged, unless they can prove that:
- you are likely to escape;
- you are likely to commit the crime again;
- you are likely and able to destroy or conceal evidence or somehow
manipulate witnesses.
Let me say this again: *after* you have been charged. This comes from
the principle that you are considered innocent until proven guilty, that
is, until the last court appeal was unsuccessful. This usually means 3
trials, and years later than the criminal proceeding start.
