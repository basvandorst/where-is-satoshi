@_subject: $15 million dollars business proposal 
Good day,
       This is Ahmed Fahyal the first son of Zayad Fahyal a millionaire Mogul of Saudi Arabia who recently died of Esophageal cancer,as diagnosed by some medical experts of Saudi Arabia. I am contacting you because of my present need to engage in a mutually beneficial business partnership with person whom I have not had dealings with before and who do not have any political indignation in my country,Saudi arabia. I got your email contact on the internet as I was looking for a God fearing person who will help save the life of my family.
It is imperative that I inform you that this transaction,is not one of those numerous scam emails you might have received in the past where you are being required by some conmen to sign out a blank cheque or give out your personal information or back account in order to perpetrate their illicit scam scheme,please note that this transaction is very legitimate and all we need is your partnership. The thrust of this mail is that presently I have with me the sum of US$15 million,which I wish to transfer abroad as discreetly and as expeditiously as possible and I wish with your help to apply this fund towards investment purposes in your country. This money was reserved by my late father for the purchase of new Machinery and coldroom equipments so as to officially establish his fishing business in Saudi Arabia. Before his untimely death however,he deposited the trunk box (vault) containing the sum of US$15 million meant for the acquisition of the Marchinery and the coldroom equipments with a Security Company in the Netherlands but were declared to the security company officials that the trunk box contain the African arts meant for export to his foreign partner for security reasons. Since the death of my father,the member of my father's family has subjected us to all sort of harrasment,embarassment and intimidations,simply because they believe that my father is their brother and too that all he owns belong to them. Infact All my father's properties,including cash at the bank had been shared by the member of my father's family without leaving anything for us (myself,my mother and my junior sister who is just 10 years,)what can we do now to survive.
However,as God may have it for me and my family,after three years the security company in the Netherlands where the vault was deposited addressed a letter to us that the term agreed on with my late father concerning the deposited box containing the $15 million dollars has expired and the consignment must be immediately cleared from their company. Infact I have written a letter to the security company concerning the clearing of the consignment (the trunk box) but was told that the deposit agreement requires the presence of the foreign partner on whose behalf the consignment was deposited before any application for the clearance of the boxes will be considered. Therefore,as a twenty years old boy,it is in view of this I am contacting you to present you as the foreign partner to my late father on whose behalf the consignment was deposited so that you can assist us retrieve the funds from the security company and then apply the funds on a lucrative investment in your country. As a matter of urgency this matter demands,we have arranged for an attorney in the netherlands who really wants to assist us retrieve the funds out of the security company with your cooperation.For your assistance my family propose to give you a commission of 25% of the total sum involved, which you shall deduct immediately the money is paid into your account. Please, I implore you to exercise the utmost discretion in keeping this matter very confidential,and whatever your decision will be please forward your response to me immediately at afahyal Thank you. may this mail receive its earliest attention Yours faithfully, Ahmed Fahyal
