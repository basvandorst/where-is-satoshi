Don't Dream It's Over
Written by: Neil Finn
Performed by: Crowded House
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're travelling with me
Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page
Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only the shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief
Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
Don't ever let them win

September 26, 2001  Bush's New Surveillance Proposals Could Bring Information Overload
By TED BRIDIS and GARY FIELDS Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Under another proposal being considered Tuesday night, all of the enhanced surveillance capabilities that the bill would give law-enforcement personnel would phase out after December 2003. Negotiators from both sides were still weighing that idea, participants said. Mr. Ashcroft Tuesday testified before a Senate panel that he opposed any "automatic sunset" of the proposed legislation.
By not allowing an automatic sunset Ashcroft says we intend to keep the country on a permanent war footing and permanently curtail 4th Amendment freedoms.  SS indeed!
"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."

The U.S. has declared war upon terrorists and those countries that support terrorists. That means that the U.S. has declared war upon itself. This year, the U.S. continued a Clinton-era policy and committed more than $100 million in foreign aid to Afghanistan — making us the country's largest humanitarian donor. In May 2001, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced an additional $43 million in relief, which includes 65,000 tons of wheat, vegetable oil, blended foods, health programs and shelter. When the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan, the CIA trained Osama Bin Laden and his ilk in how to commit acts of terrorism and the U.S. provided financing and arms.

Beyond the Obvious
The record shows that even transitions that are undeniably real in retrospect may not be acknowledged for decades or even centuries after they happen. Consider the fall of Rome. It was probably the most important historic development in the first millennium of the Christian era. Yet long after Rome's demise, the fiction that it survived was held out to public view, like Lenin's embalmed corpse. No one who depended upon the pretenses of officials for his understanding of the "news" would have learned that Rome had fallen until long after that information ceased to matter.
The reason was not merely the inadequacy of communications in the ancient world. The outcome would have been much the same had CNN miraculously been in business, running its videotape in September 476. That is when the last Roman emperor in the West, Romulus Augustulus, was captured in Ravenna and forcibly retired to a villa in Campania on a pension. Even if Wolfe Blitzer had been there with minicams recording the news in 476, it is unlikely that he or anyone else would have dared to characterize those events as marking the end of the Roman Empire. That, of course, is exactly what latter historians said happened.
CNN editors probably would not have approved a headline story saying "Rome fell this evening." The powers that be denied that Rome had fallen. Peddlers of "news" seldom are partisans of controversy in ways that would undermine their own profits. They may be partisan. They may even be outrageously so. But they seldom report conclusions that would convince subscribers to cancel their subscriptions and head for the hills. Which is why few would have reported the fall of Rome even if it had been technologically possible. Experts would have come forth to say that it was ridiculous to speak of Rome falling. To have said otherwise would have been bad for business and, perhaps, bad for the health of those doing the reporting. The powers in late fifth century Rome were barbarians, and they denied that Rome had fallen.
But it was not merely a case of authorities' saying, "Don't report this or we will kill you." Part of the problem was that Rome was already so degenerate by the later decades of the fifth century that its "fall" genuinely eluded the notice of most people who lived through it. In fact, it was a generation later before Count Marcellinus first suggested that "The Western Roman Empire perished with this Augustulus." 4 Many more decades passed, perhaps centuries, before there was a common acknowledgment that the Roman Empire in the West no longer existed. Certainly Charlemagne believed that he was a legitimate Roman emperor in the year 800.
The point is not that Charlemagne and all who thought in conventional terms about the Roman Empire after 476 were fools. To the contrary. The characterization of social developments is frequently ambiguous. When the power of predominant institutions is brought into the bargain to reinforce a convenient conclusion, even one based largely on pretense, only someone of strong character and strong opinions would dare contradict it. If you try to put yourself in the position of a Roman of the late fifth century, it is easy to imagine how tempting it would have been to conclude that nothing had changed. That certainly was the optimistic conclusion. To have thought otherwise might have been frightening. And why come to a frightening conclusion when a reassuring one was at hand?
After all, a case could have been made that business would continue as usual. It had in the past. The Roman army, and particularly the frontier garrisons, had been barbarized for centuries. By the third century, it had become regular practice for the army to proclaim a new emperor. By the fourth century, even officers were Germanized and frequently illiterate. There had been many violent overthrows of emperors before Romulus Augustulus was removed from the throne. His departure might have seemed no different to his contemporaries than many other upheavals in a chaotic time. And he was sent packing with a pension. The very fact that he received a pension, even for a brief period before he was murdered, was a reassurance that the system survived. To an optimist, Odoacer, who deposed Romulus Augustulus, reunified rather than destroyed the empire. A son of Attila's sidekick Edecon, Odoacer was a clever man. He did not proclaim himself emperor. Instead, he convened the Senate and!
 prevailed upon its toosuggestible members that they offer the emperorship and thus sovereignty over the whole empire to Zeno, the Eastern emperor in faraway Byzantium. Odoacer was merely to be Zeno's patricius to govern Italy.
As Will Durant wrote in The Story of Civilization, these changes did not appear to be the "fall of Rome" but merely "negligible shifts on the surface of the national scene." When Rome fell, Odoacer said that Rome endured. He, along with almost everyone else, was keen to pretend that nothing had changed. They knew that "the glory that was Rome" was far better than the barbarism that was taking its place. Even the barbarians thought so. As C. W Previte-Orton wrote in The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History, the end of the fifth century, when "the Emperors had been replaced by barbaric German kings," was a time of "persistent make-believe."

The Taboo on Foresight
To see "outside" an existing system breaches a convention that helps keep the system functioning. Every social order incorporates among its key taboos the notion that people living in it should not think about how it will end and what rules may prevail in the new system that takes its place. Implicitly, whatever system exists is the last or the only system that will ever exist. Not that this is so baldly stated. Few who have ever read a history book would find such an assumption realistic if it was articulated. Nonetheless, that is the convention that rules the world. Every social system, however strongly or weakly it clings to power, pretends that its rules will never be superseded: They are the last word. Or perhaps the only word. Primitives assume that theirs is the only possible way of organizing life. More economically complicated systems that incorporate a sense of history usually place themselves at its apex. Whether they are Chinese mandarins in the court of the empe!
ror, the Marxist nomenklatura in Stalin's Kremlin, or members of the House of Representatives in Washington, the powers﷓that﷓be either imagine no history at all or place themselves at the pinnacle of history, in a superior position compared to everyone who came before, and the vanguard of anything to come.
This is true for practical reasons. The more apparent it is that a system is nearing an end, the more reluctant people will be to adhere to its laws. Any social organization will therefore tend to discourage or play down analyses that anticipate its demise. This alone helps ensure that history's great transitions are seldom spotted as they happen. If you know nothing else about the future, you can rest assured that dramatic changes will be neither welcomed nor advertised by conventional thinkers.
You cannot depend upon conventional information sources to give you an objective and timely warning about how the world is changing and why. You have little choice but to figure it out for yourself.

In The Sovereign Individual, Davidson and Rees-Mogg explore the greatest economic and political transition in centuries -- the shift from an industrial to an information-based society.

Their prediction is that nation states will be reduced significantly in
global influence by the combination of the Internet (especially anonymous
digital money) and the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons in
the hands of smaller nation states, idiological groups and even

Historically this has often failed (e.g., the lack of outcry against Japanese internment camps).  Neighboors are willing to sell their liberty and their neighbors at the drop of a hat if someone in government promises them greater security, even though these same liars failed them time and time again.  Since the New Deal Americans and corporations have become increasingly reliant on government to provide for them, shield them from their own poor judgement and folly and transfer the responsibility to the rest of us.  (Citizens of a like mind should structure upcoming tax filings to deduct Congress' largess to the airlines and others).  We cannot depend on these cowards and weaklings.

Changes that diminish the power of predominant institutions are both unsettling and dangerous. Just as monarchs, lords, popes, and potentates fought ruthlessly to preserve their accustomed privileges in the early stages of the modern period, so today's governments will employ violence, often of a covert and arbitrary kind, in the attempt to hold back the clock. Weakened by the challenge from technology, the state will treat increasingly autonomous individuals, its former citizens, with the same range of ruthlessness and diplomacy it has heretofore displayed in its dealing with other governments. The advent of this new stage in history was punctuated with a bang on August 20, 1998, when the United States fired about $200 million worth of Tomahawk BGM-109 sea-launched cruise missiles at targets allegedly associated with an exiled Saudi millionaire, Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden became the first person in history to have his satellite phone targeted for attack by cruise missiles. !
Simultaneously, the United States destroyed a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan, in Bin Laden's honor. The emergence of Bin Laden as the enemy-in-chief of the United States reflects a momentous change in the nature of warfare. A single individual, albeit one with hundreds of millions of dollars, can now be depicted as a plausible threat to the greatest military power of the Industrial era. In statements reminiscent of propaganda employed during the Cold War about the Soviet Union, the United States president and his national security aides portrayed Bin Laden, a private individual, as a transnational terrorist and leading enemy of the United States.
The same military logic that has seen Osama bin Laden elevated to a position as the chief enemy of the United States will assert itself in governments' internal relations with their subjects. Increasingly harsh techniques of exaction will be a logical corollary of the emergence of a new type of bargaining between governments and individuals. Technology will make individuals more nearly sovereign than ever before. And they will be treated that way. Sometimes violently, as enemies, sometimes as equal parties in negotiation, sometimes as allies. But however ruthlessly governments behave, particularly in the transition period, wedding the IRS with the CIA will avail them little. They will be increasingly required by the press of necessity to bargain with autonomous individuals whose resources will no loner be so easily controlled.

statements by cypherpunks that those who disagree "need killing", that

horror and disgust at the terrorist acts should recognize that the same

threats of bloodshed are based on the same philosophy of violent hatred
and contempt for others which motivates the terrorists.

There is, therefore, no natural sanctity in the State any more than there is in the weather.

Many prisoners are targeted for sexual exploitation the minute they enter a
penal facility; their age, looks, sexual preference and other
characteristics mark them as candidates for maltreatment. In a new
groundbreaking report, Human Rights Watch documents the widespread
prisoner-on-prisoner rape in U.S. men's prisons. The rights group accuses
state authorities of not taking measures to prevent and punish rape and, in
many cases, for allowing this cruel form of abuse to persist.

Individuals are morally free to make the decision when the "Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends."  And its their soverign duty to make war against the tyranny.  Remember that only a small, perhaps less than 10%, of the Colonials took an active part in revolting against the Crowne.  All Tim has done is advocated the same sort of treatment the founders advocated for formation of our country.  All the goverment has done is to criminalize any utter of similar treatment of itself.  Reminds me of the bumper stickers "Welcome to California, Now Go Home."  Just what one expects from a statist group.  Its OK that we were founded by revolution  but not that we may be subjected to another revolution. Same as it ever was.
While it is true that much of the early CP list debate centered on technology for empowerment of privacy, it was also regularly discussed that eventually the government might decide that such freedoms were damaging to their hegemony and take measures to punish adherents and suppliers of these "munitions".  When one is subjected to tyranny one has several choices, including: hiding, kneeling and waiting for the shit to blow over, and fighting.  This fighting may be in the legal arena, but in times of "national emergency" the likelyhood of finding an unbiased ear on the bench or the jury box may preclude a fair trial.  In that case one might identify the oppressors and individually target them.  I suggest if you find expression of such logical sentiment objectionable that you leave the list.

Many of the works in the Loompanics catalogue are practical, how-to, manuals on manufacture and use of weapons, some now classed as illegal.
The barriers to law enforcement in obtaining this type of information is part of the balance struck between individual civil liberties and the easy with which law enforcement is able to carry out some of their mandate to identify and capture criminals.  It is only in a police state that law enforcement's job is "easy."  Despite my concern over the possession of such information by some who have plans to use it to hurt others, I have no interest in seeing this balance tipped toward enforcement.
Anyone who looked for their inept government security agencies to provide all or most of their security were fools.  Any who continue to look for this protection going forward are larger fools.  To paraphrase P.T. Barnum, "A fool and their life are soon parted."  Your safety is most assured when you take personal responsibility.
The reasons for this failure have been much publicized and ignored over the past two decades.  The massive funding of these agencies post Sept. 11 are unlikely to have any immediate positive effects as money was never the primary problem.
This seems to be based on the assumption that one does not have a fundamental right to property: the right to possess it or transfer it.  That roadblocks need to be erected to prevent us from efficiently exercising this right.  The right to privacy, especially financial privacy is a basis of democratic government.  By limiting the manner in which one may hold property, especially without the knowledge of government agencies or ones neighbors, we greatly limit our freedom of private property ownership and privacy.
I'm sure you can think of others.  I'd put anthrax and other biological or chemical weapons into that category, too.  I'd hope that anyone buying (or attempting to buy) such stuff would at least slightly raise an eyebrow on the part of SOMEONE charged with helping to maintain a society that's safe to live in.  It's clearly NOT enough to only monitor such things on the part of madmen like Saddam Hussein... clearly, we have crazy people right here in the United States, too.  They're no less in need of at least some oversight to make sure that they don't go off the deep end and endanger as much as an entire city (or possibly even worse).
From the Declaration of Independence the right of individuals to overthrow their governments when THEY feel that it has come ignore basic civil liberties has been enshrined.  While some might insist that massive civil unrest is the only legitimate means of achieving an overthrow I would remind you that fewer than 10% of the American Colonials took an active part in the Revolution.  This was definitely a case of asymmetrical warfare and the British considered these Colonists terrorists (although this term was not used).  Without the help of France is most unlikely that our side would have prevailed.
Abraham Lincoln :
"Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it." "First Inaugural Address" (available at  "Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable,---a most sacred right---a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government, may choose to exercise it." (Speech in the United States House of Representatives, Jan. 12, 1848) You or I certainly couldn't consider overthrowing our government with a pistol, rifle or shotgun. The individual possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction is fundamental to exercise of our rights.  The Supreme Court essentially came to this conclusion in the case of Miller vs. U.S, but shortly thereafter it beat a hasty retreat in Case vs. U.S.
"In view of this, if the rule of the Miller case is general and complete, the result would follow that, under present day conditions, the federal government would be empowered only to regulate the possession or use of weapons such as a flintlock musket or a matchlock harquebus. But to hold that the Second Amendment limits the federal government to regulations concerning only weapons which can be classed as antiques or curiosities,--almost any other might bear some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia unit of the present day,--is in effect to hold that the limitation of the Second Amendment is absolute. Another objection to the rule of the Miller case as a full and general statement is that according to it Congress would be prevented by the Second Amendment from regulating the possession or use by private persons not present or prospective members of any military unit, of distinctly military arms, such as machine guns, trench m!
ortars, anti-tank or anti-aircraft guns, even though under the circumstances surrounding such possession or use it would be inconceivable that a private person could have any legitimate reason for having such a weapon. It seems to us unlikely that the framers of the Amendment intended any such result."  So, where we sit now is that we have a fundamental right to overthrow our government by violence but the discussion of this subject or possession of the means is a felony.
But since this expensive security has now been shown to be ineffective don't you think those citizens are entitled to a refund?  These expenditures were foolish but should individuals be held responsible for the folly of their fellow citizens?  Should I be able to sue our government for reimbursement of the costs of living in a gated and guarded community because I think the police have "created a dangerous condition" by not providing an adequate level of protection to my family?  This is a fools game.

A recent speech by former FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth is rather refreshing. A key quote.
"Today, when the federal government violates the constitution including the First Amendment, we mostly find silence from the media."
There is little doubt that much that we have taken for granted in the United States has changed in the past two months.  Our feeling of security, our confidence in the safety of public facilities, and our general sense of well-being have all been shaken. The poignant question is raised about whether the First Amendment—particularly the speech provision--has changed, or perhaps whether the government’s interpretation of it has changed.  I have some good news.  The words of the First Amendment are the same today as they were two months ago, or two years ago, or two decades ago, or two centuries ago. But I also have some bad news.  The First Amendment has been violated many times in the past two centuries.  As Floyd Abrams noted earlier this morning, many of our greatest national leaders have taken great liberties in curtailing the First Amendment, particularly in times of crisis.  And it is not just our great leaders, and it is not only in times of crisis, that the First Amendment has been violated.  The constitution itself, and the First Amendment in particular, are violated frequently. Moreover, those who violate the constitution are rarely held accountable.  Public servants largely have immunity for liability in their performance of their public functions.  But, when it comes to the constitution, that immunity often turns into impunity, a veritable license to violate at will.  Aside from occasional public disapprobation, there is no penalty for violating the Constitution generally or the First Amendment in particular.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Shouting ``nothing tops freedom,'' an Egyptian student forgave the FBI on Thursday for throwing him in jail after an aviation radio was found in his hotel room near the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
Abdallah Higazy, 30, was released late Wednesday after a month in detention because another hotel guest -- a private pilot -- told officials the radio was his.
``To be absolutely honest, I don't blame the FBI for thinking it was mine,'' Higazy said. He offered to take two agents who interrogated him to dinner so everyone could ``bury the hatchet.''

    Constitutional Convention would be of any real positive value in

    My answer is to create a new style of political group. The group
    would exist in each state with a central group in the capital,
    ancillary groups in other communities as needed. They would be
    involved in state and local elections to promote specific amendments
    to the Constitution. The specific goal being to get elected
    officials who see the amendments in a positive light. These
    groups would take their direction from a national group who
    acted within the confines of specific 'party platforms'. The
    ultimate goal would be to elect state legislators and executives
    who would be inclined to ratify a proposed amendment. Such an
    amendment would go into effect with no federal intervention.
    In other words, if a proposed amendment were to be on the
    necessary number of state legislators calendars at the same
    time. And the vote could be influenced in a particular way
    the Amendment would go into full force. At no stage of this
    process there be federal oversight or review.
I don't think anything short of anon. betting pools will work in today's political climate of wealth redistribution and "textualist" interpretative SC decisions.

@_subject: How to deal with Jack Valenti 
In honor of Saint Patrick's Day, here's a reminder that one of Ireland's
other patron saints, Saint Columba, may have pioneered the anti-copyright
movement way back in the sixth century (A.D. 555, to be exact):
     St. Columba had borrowed from the monk a fine manuscript of the
Gospels, and Columba had made a copy of the borrowed book, before returning
it.  The monk claimed the copy also as his; the saint disputed this.  His
argument in defence reads not unlike the defence made by modern infringers
of copyright:  "I confess that the book in question was copied from the
manuscript of Finnen.  But it was with my own industry and toil and burning
of the midnight oil.  And it was copied with such care that Finnen's
manuscript is in no way injured by the act of copying.  Moreover, my object
was to preserve more surely the best parts of the book and employ them for
the greater glory of God.  Hence I do not admit that I have done any injury
to Finnen; nor am liable for restitution, nor am at fault in any way."  But
Dermot, the judge, as manuscripts were then new in Ireland, had no exact
precedent, and he cast about for the nearest analogy.  He found the Brehon
maxim, "With every cow goes its calf", "Le cach boin a boinin"; and so his
judgment was in favor of the monk, because "Le cach lebar a lebran", "With
every book goes the young of the book". (But the saint, it is recorded, was
very angry at this judgment, invoked the power of a rival chieftain against
Dermot, and thrashed him well in battle.)  [Wigmore, John H., _A Panorama of
the World's Legal Systems_, Washington DC, 1936, p. 677]

Supreme Court Strikes Down Ban on Virtual Child Pornography
By DAVID STOUT
WASHINGTON, April 16  In a case that addresses some of the most fundamental issues of technology and morality, the United States Supreme Court ruled today that Congress went too far in 1996, when it passed a law that treats "virtual" or computer-generated child pornography as the real thing.
The court held, 6 to 3, that the Child Pornography Prevention Act is overly broad and unconstitutional, despite its supporters' arguments that computer-generated smut depicting children could stimulate pedophiles to molest youngsters.
"The sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people," Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in the majority decision. Nevertheless, he said, if the 1996 law were allowed to stand, the Constitution's First Amendment right to free speech would be "turned upside down."
"Congress may pass valid laws to protect children from abuse, and it has," Justice Kennedy wrote. "The prospect of crime, however, by itself does not justify laws suppressing protected speech."

WASHINGTON, May 30  Two men charged with carrying pistols without a license in the District of Columbia have invoked the Bush administration's position on guns to seek the dismissal of their cases.
Reversing decades of Justice Department policy, the Bush administration told the Supreme Court this month that it believes the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess firearms.
Lawyers for the two men, Michael Freeman and Manuel Brown, say the position is inconsistent with a ruling in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Today, the Justice Department urged the continued prosecution of the men. The controlling precedent upholds the city's firearm statutes, "even though it contains reasoning that is inconsistent with the position of the United States," the department said in court papers

@_subject: Why asymmetrical warefare practitioners have nothing to fear 
[An edited copy of "Who Let the Terrorists Succeed?" The now-famous memo Minneapolis agent Coleen Rowley sent to Robert Mueller, director of the FBI, now widely known as the Federal Bureau of Incompetence. The May 21, 2002 memo, obtained by Time, is one scary document. It suggests [SURPRISE!] that we have a bunch of time-servers protecting our security, which no one is in charge of anything. If any of this changed after September 11, Rowley, a highly regarded veteran of the bureau, does not say so.
        Without mentioning names, Rowley basically fingers a mid-level FBI supervisory agent in the Hoover Building (in Washington) named Dave Frasca, who was supposed to be running the task force on religious fanatics. After the Minneapolis office took flight-student and hijacker-wannabe Zacarias Moussaoui into custody and obtained intelligence from the French indicating that he had terrorist ties, alert Minnesota agents didnt just passively push the case up the chain of command. They became, in Rowleys words, desperate to search his computer laptop. So desperate that they risked the wrath of higher ups by committing a real pre-9-11 no-no: contacting the CIA.
        Headquarters personnel didnt just deny the request to probe Moussaoui further. Even though they were privy to many more sources of intelligence information than field agents, as Rowley plaintively put it, they continued to, almost inexplicably, throw up roadblocks and undermine Minneapolis by-now desperate attempts to obtain a search warrant.
        Because Frascas not commenting publicly, we havent heard the other side of the story. But as anyone who has ever worked in an office knows, HQ always has its own take on events, and sometimes its even right. In this case a federal judge in Washington, Royce C. Lambreth, grew annoyed at the poor documentation involved in requests from federal prosecutors for search warrants and wiretaps. One prosecutor so angered Lambreth that he was actually barred from seeking any more approvals from judges, a move that sent a chilling career message down through the ranks of the Justice Department. So Frasca, knowing which way the wind was blowing in Washington, wasnt just going to rubber stamp the Minneapolis request.
[Does this mean the complaints by civil libertarians that FESA were being heard?]
        Moreover, the very fact that HQ is, in Rowleys words, privy to many more sources of intelligence is actually a hindrance, not necessarily a sign of negligence. The more intelligence chaff that comes in, the harder it is to find the wheat. Frasca should have the chance to explain that, and Judge Lambreth should explain why he thought the warrant process was being abused.           But Rowleys certainly correct when she tells Mueller that the problem with chalking this all up to the 20/20 hindsight is perfect problem  is that this is not a case of everyone in the FBI failing to appreciate the potential consequences. It is obvious that the agents in Minneapolis who were closest to the action and in the best position to gauge the situation locally did fully appreciate the terrorist risk/danger posed by Moussaoui.
        Doesnt that sound familiar in your company? The branch offices never think headquarters knows whats really going on, while the home office VPs think the branch guys are a bunch of whiners without the chops to make it in the big time at HQ.         But in this evergreen of bureaucratic in-fighting, one of HQs best arguments is usually that unlike the branch offices, it sees the big picture. This time, as Rowley notes, Frasca and company not only failed to see the big picture, they worked actively to keep others from trying to see it. Thats quite an indictment.
        And thats only part of her bombshell. Rowley, who is, fortunately for her, close to retirement, also goes after Mueller himself. I have deep concerns that a delicate and subtle shading/skewering of facts by you and others at the highest levels of the FBI has occurred and is occurring. She argues that Muellers reorganization, which would further empower the FBIs Washington headquarters, is exactly the wrong approach to preventing terrorism.
        As if to confirm Rowleys harsh judgment, Mueller last week classified her memo, though we learned after it was leaked that there is nothing even vaguely compromising about FBI sources and methods contained in it. He classified it for the same reason Bush and Cheney dont want an independent commission to investigate what happened: Its embarrassing.
        Now its up to the rest of us to decide. [Unfortunately its not.  If it were the problem would have been addresses decades ago.]
Is embarrassment a proper standard for classifying documents and sweeping poor performance under the carpet? Or is it perhaps more patrioticand better for preventing a future attack to get to the bottom of what happened in order to make the necessary bureaucratic changes?
        This is a deep question for American democracy. The issue is not accountability versus security; its accountability versus embarrassment and political discomfort.
[The problem is that individuals are prevented from pursuing criminal prosecutions.]
[That's why its so important that insiders have a practical means (e.g., John Young's site) to leak mis-classified data.]
        Mueller argues that the reform of the FBI is already underway, and need not be disrupted by a lot of finger-pointing. Let him do it in private, the administration asks. Let the company handle its own affairs. But that assumes a universe where Mr. Mooney doesnt need Lucys suggestions, and Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin should just shut up. It assumes a world where Dilbert has no cause for complaint.
        That wasnt life before September 11, or after. Bureaucracies ossify. Office politics grows more bitter with time. Sometimes the only answer is the kind of wholesale reorganization we dont seem to be getting so far. [The kind or "re-organization" we need is way beyond anything the mainstream media, not to mention D.C., could even understand.  There is no reason to believe that our fearless leaders will be anymore successful in catching these new villains than they have the drug kingpins and narco-terrorists.  The impact of these failures will, however, be immeasurably higher.]

Flight Schools See Downside to Crackdown
By DAVID FIRESTONE with MATTHEW L. WALD
The security crackdown meant to keep terrorist hijackers out of American flight schools has forced thousands of foreign students to train overseas, weakening the country's global dominance in aviation training, officials in the industry say.
That shift, they warn, could ultimately mean greater risks for air travelers, because American flight schools are the main source of well-trained commercial pilots for foreign airlines.

US media cowed by patriotic fever, says CBS star
Network news veteran admits national mood caused him to shrink from
tough questions on war in Afghanistan
Matthew Engel in Washington
Friday May 17, 2002
The Guardian
Dan Rather, the star news anchor for the US television network CBS,
said last night that "patriotism run amok" was in danger of trampling
the freedom of American journalists to ask tough questions. And he
admitted that he had shrunk from taking on the Bush administration
over the war on terrorism.
In the weeks after September 11 Rather wore a Stars and Stripes pin in
his lapel during his evening news show in an apparent display of total
solidarity with the American cause. However, in an interview with
BBC's Newsnight, he graphically described the pressures to conform
that built up after the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the
"It is an obscene comparison - you know I am not sure I like it - but
you know there was a time in South Africa that people would put
flaming tyres around people's necks if they dissented. And in some
ways the fear is that you will be necklaced here, you will have a
flaming tyre of lack of patriotism put around your neck," he
said. "Now it is that fear that keeps journalists from asking the
toughest of the tough questions."
Rather did not exempt himself from the criticism, and said the problem
was self-censorship. "It starts with a feeling of patriotism within
oneself. It carries through with a certain knowledge that the country
as a whole - and for all the right reasons - felt and continues to
feel this surge of patriotism within themselves. And one finds oneself
saying: 'I know the right question, but you know what? This is not
exactly the right time to ask it.'"
Such a confession is astonishing, bearing in mind its source. Rather
is almost as famous in the US as the president, though he is more
secure in his tenure, far better paid and probably more pampered.
Rather, 70, has held what used to be regarded as the top job in
American journalism for two decades, since he was chosen to succeed
the revered and avuncular Walter Cronkite as CBS News's
anchorman. Traditionally, CBS was the country's No 1 news channel but
has lost its status and ratings after years of budget cutbacks.
The White House was to blame for its failure to provide adequate
information about the war, Rather said. "There has never been an
American war, small or large, in which access has been so limited as
this one.
"Limiting access, limiting information to cover the backsides of those
who are in charge of the war, is extremely dangerous and cannot and
should not be accepted. And I am sorry to say that, up to and
including the moment of this interview, that overwhelmingly it has
been accepted by the American people. And the current administration
revels in that, they relish that, and they take refuge in that."
He said his view of the patriotism differed from that of the
administration. "It's unpatriotic not to stand up, look them in the
eye, and ask the questions they don't want to hear - they being those
who have the responsibility, the ultimate responsibility - of sending
our sons and daughters, our husbands, wives, our blood, to face death.

[Its not clear Ashcroft is making good on his promise to press for real 2nd Amendment reform or what the Justice Department's true intentions are.  It cites two cases before the SC: Emerson vs. U.S. and Haney vs. U.S.  In both cases it says the SC should reject the defendant appeals as they both fall under what they consider "... the narrowly tailored restrictions by which that right could be reasonably be limited."  What double talk and backpeddling. Haney in particular raises just those issues at the heart of Miller vs. U.S.
The article, as usual in the liberal press, continues a common 2nd Amendment misinterpretation of one of the key conclusions one can draw from Miller: that the government may only regulate firearms not useful in military applications.  This interpretation was so freightening to the Feds that the SC reversed itself shortly therafter, in Case vs. U.S., in which they held that this particular Miller interpretation could not possibly stand because it would, for all intents and purposes, nullify Fed firearm regs, and no matter any plain reading of the Constitution that cannot be allowed.]

The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.
The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum of 4 per cent of Americans to report "suspicious activity".

Wrong target.  Suggest you rename it "L-day" for federal Legislator Day.
Members should consider themselves patriots in the true sense.  Since not many citizens are so ideological, I suggest a voluntary redistribution of wealth from the ideological to the families of those patriots who take up the challenge.  Likely participants may be those who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and have not been economically fortunate (or wasteful enough) to leave their families a meaningful inheretance.
The sooner the redistribution stops the sooner the economic health of the nation will improve.
Loading up the nation with debt and leaving it for the following generations to pay is morally irresponsible. Excessive debt is a means by which governments oppress the people and waste their substance. No nation has a right to contract debt for periods longer than the majority contracting it can expect to live.
