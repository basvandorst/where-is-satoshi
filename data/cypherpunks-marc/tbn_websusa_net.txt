LOW COST COMPUTER INVENTORY POSTING & EMAIL BROADCASTING SITE
Fellow Traders:
I have previously broadcasted and/or posted inventory on websites including:
CCICLS, ATC, Vendorbase,Tradeloop, The Computer Exchange among others.
Where they have all been reputable and have given me exactly what they said they would
the cost ranges from $79-$149 per month and all I have basically paid for is
the privilege to post / source product and email broadcast.
Below is information on a site that does the above for $29.95 and also offers:
Inspection Services, Purchase Order Funding, Freight Options, Escrow
Services, Warehousing, Credit Reports, unlimited domestic business
telephone service ($99.95/ mo), Medical Dental Plan, and Vehicle Leasing.
ie to plug in to the ancillary services, the site is providing inventory posting/sourcing
and email broadcasting at 38%-79% LESS THAT WHAT WE PRESENTLY PAY!
THE INSPECTION SERVICE IS WORTH IT ALONE ! I am tired of having product constantly
misrepresented to me. This one feature could protect us all.
