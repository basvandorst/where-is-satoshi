A wallet client or a miner? CPU/GPU mining costs significantly more in
electricity than the return. I didn't think anyone was still CPU or
GPU mining. You really need an ASIC at this point to be profitable.
A wallet client shouldn't interfere with Myth (it's not intensive),
but in my case the TV isn't a convenient place to initiate
mythtv-users mailing list
