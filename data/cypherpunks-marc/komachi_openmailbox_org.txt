PM Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree about an upgrade to Russian
surveillance system targeted to users of websites.
It says that "organizer of spreading of the information" must sign a
plan with Federal Security Service to install surveillance
software/hardware with direct link to Federal Security Service, like it
works with ISPs and other communication providers now. The details about
installed software and hardware is confidential. It's not clear who will
pay for this, but probably it will be resource owners, like it work with
ISPs and other communication operators.
"Organizer of spreading of the information" is a term introduced by
Federal law N 97-FZ of 05.05.2014 (called by media "bloggers law"
because it also force bloggers to register in special "bloggers
registry"), it means somebody who make works something that send any
information over the Internet, basically it's any website, email server
or anything. That law also force them to store all logs about user's
actions (even for anonymous users) for 6 months.
It's not only Federal Security Service who can access that information,
it's any authority who has the right to do operative investigate
activities. Currently it's near 6 authorities, including Federal Drug
Service, Federal Tax Service, Federal Guard Service and others.
Federal law N 97-FZ of 05.05.2014 came in force on 1st August.
From the fact that Russian telephone surveillance system called SORM
(system for operative investigative activities), SORM-2 for Internet,
and SORM-3 for storing logs, this can be named SORM-4.

Surrogates actually banned since 90s, but nobody knows what money
surrogates is, there was no lawful definition, and as far I remember,
first time it was used in a letters from Bank of Russia and Prosecutor
General which says Bitcoin is surrogates
Funny thing that with such definition they ban anything except ruble,
including money in computer games, some payment systems, etc.
Russian Duma acts crazy last time, they voted for many crazy bills, and
this one will just continue the trend, so there probably no real reason
for ban. Bitcoin is not so popular in Russia, it take a really little
part in drug deals or anything other, but probably they will attempt to
justify the ban with drugs, there is some talks on drugs started last
time, which very overestimated the problem.
That probably will work like "we google bitcoin and ban first 20 or more
links, repeat every day/week/month", that way it works with drugs or
suicides, they banned many doorways, jokes or even slang terms not
related to any crime (like an article on boosters from EVE Online, in

article which recommends you to commit a suicide with starting WWIII,

"...hryvnia is the only legal tender in Ukraine, adopted by all natural
and legal persons without any restriction on all territory of Ukraine
for the transfer and settlement.
Issuing and turnover any other currencies [besides hryvnia] and using of
money surrogates for payments is forbidden<...>
Given the above, National Bank of Ukraine considers "virtual
currency/cryptocurrency" Bitcoin as a money surrogate that isn't
providing real value and can not be used by individuals and entities on
the territory of Ukraine for payments, because it is contrary to the
norms of Ukrainian legislation.
However, the international distribution of such payments attractive for
illegal activities, including money laundering and financing of
terrorist activities.
We emphasize that user is responsible for all the risks in use "virtual
currency/cryptocurrency" Bitcoin. National Bank of Ukraine as a
regulator is not liable for risks and losses associated with use of
"virtual currency/cryptocurrency" Bitcoin.
In order to protect consumers rights and safety of money transfer,
National Bank of Ukraine encourages citizens to use services of only
those payment systems/settlement systems, which included the National
Bank's Registry of payment systems, settlement systems, participants in
these systems and service providers of payment infrastructure."
So it's not says Ukraine bans Bitcoin (some media already published such

any other informations which distribution can harm national interest of
the Republic of Belarus, or forbidden by this law, or by any other

this will be blocked. Also the law forbids any media with more than 20%
of foreign investors.
The law was passed really fast, only on 17st it came info parliament,
and today, 21st, it's already signed by president. Nobody ever heard
that such law are coming, even in the rumors.
The law will came into force on 1st January.
Yesterday domain name onliner.by, which hosted Belarusian media portal,
was seized. They moved to onliner.ru.

How it works?
ISPs install the iMarker equipment and mirror all user's traffic on it
(Russian surveillance system, SORM, works the same way). Software takes
time, URL and HTTP Headers from HTTP requests. Then scraper with IP
92.242.35.54 and User-Agent WebIndex follow every visited URL and
analyze its content. All this information used to build a profile for
user. They says that information is removed right after analysis, and
software saves only result of that analysis. Their website lists that
they categorize users by search queries, online shopping activity, time
of visits, activity on social networks, keywords on visited pages,
visited websites, social-demographic info, such as sex, age, marital
status, and education level, and then they use that data to distribute
users for consumers groups. Every user has some kind of pseudonymous ID
with linked profile.
It's also has an opt-out option How many users affected?
They says it's 38 million people all over Russia. Minister of
Communication Nikolay Nikiforov said in 2014 there was 62 million people
in Russia using Internet, 56m of them do it every day, so it's 61% of
Russian Internet users. iMarker's website list Akado, Rostelecom,
ER-Telecom, NetByNet, Qwerty, and TTK as ISPs that installed iMarker's

prohibited by Russian law, and the law allow courts to prohibit
distribution of any information in Russia.
For reason, it says that: "Free distribution of information about
electronic currency causes active use of cryptocurrencies for drug,
arms, and forgery dealing and other criminal activity. These facts, as
well as ability to uncontrollable transboundary money transfer followed
by cashing in, are hight-risk approaches for potential using

The data-leaking blog Anonymous International, also known as

project proposal for creating a "national information platform," which
would serve as an alternative Russian Internet.
According to Anonymous International, the project was drawn up by
Russiaâs Foreign Trade Bank cluster analysis and spatial development
director Sergey Ganzya, the IT director of the hydroelectricity company
RusHydro, Garald Bandurin, and several other people. The leaked content
includes email correspondence and a document about the project.
In the leaked emails, the authors of the project discuss the creation of
âan entirely custom IT platform that can expand globally.â The
development of such a platform can serve as âimport substitution in the
IT sphereâ and âcreate a secure national digital environment with lower

The document published by Anonymous International mentions Russiaâs
direct dependence on âthe goodwill and decency of global providers of IT
solutions.â The authors of the document believe that âthere are no
objective guarantees that, in the event of a conflict, Western security

the infrastructure.â
The leaked emails between the projectâs authors refer to the âgeneral

@_subject: Russia actually kind of cracked (?) Tor 
group "to study the possibility of obtaining technical information on
users and users' equipment of Tor anonymous network" for $59,000. When
media reports appeared, mentioning of Tor was deleted.
Then company who won this contract (The Central Research Institute of
Economics, Informatics, and Control Systems, subsidiary of Rostec) then
posted a contract to hire a law firm tasked with negotiating a way out
of the deal
Now source of Kommersant close to the one of two parties of the deal
says that project was nearly finished, but CRI EICS didn't meet the
deadline, so that why there is court involved. Results was passed to the
Interior Ministry where it's already in use.
Representative of hired law firm told Kommersant that Interior Ministry
wants to just knock down the price or force CRI EICS to pay the forfeit.
Kommersant piece also mention a case when one user was deanonymized when
he used Tor Browser to post trip reports and prosecuted for propaganda
of illegal substances (I don't believe that was result of "cracking
Tor", he probably failed somehow (maybe used real name), also it would
be strange to perform probably costly attack for fine less than $100).

I don't think it was ordered by Facebook leadership or something like
that. The truth is that FB has pretty flawed mechanism of blocking, so
any page that received many abuses from FB users will be banned for some
time without any action from FB mods. Both pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian
pages were banned many times this way, including ones with verified
accounts. Here is some The Guardian report on blocking Russian
opposition activists and Ukrainian bloggers pages, for example
So there is no conspiracy, just a lot of users abusing FB's abuse
mechanism and FB doing nothing with that.
But FB really censored an event page of opposition rally in Russia
following Russian request

Zenaan Harkness:
Well currently Russia has many problems with transparent spending. Even
if tenders are public, it's still problematic to cancel clearly corrupt
tenders. They often build it in such way that only one affiliated
company can participate, like "company should had at least N workers,
with N workers with Z certificates" and so on.
So the idea of moving to free software is awesome (when the idea of ban
foreign software is not), but realization would be flawed because of how
Russia works.
Yes, I know, and I don't think there is any problems with providing
services for money. By "overpriced services" Ivan means kickbacks, it's
not special for software.
But it's a proprietary freedom-denying community-compromising software
that you get from Astra Linux that clearly violates GPL, I don't think
it's any better. If they fix that problem and opensource everything,
that would be awesome, but now it's bad.
It's not only military actually. Government company VNIINS just removed
all copyrights from RedHat, added some functionality and now sells it to
authorities, mostly military, but it's also used by drug police and others.
There was a govt decree about moving to free software, but it mostly
failed. For example, all schools was forced to install ALT Linux in
2007, if I remember correctly. They did, but it was installed in
dualboot with Windows and used only to show inspectors that well, here
is your Linux, we're in compliance (initially there was no accepted by
Ministry of Education books, only courses for teachers, but even that
was almost stopped when Putin came back, so that result was obvious).
Money was spend, but with no actual results. So Russia tried to jump on
the free libre software bandwagon for years with little or no success.
But also there was some successful migrations to free software, for
example, all clinics in Moscow moved to ALT Linux. There was no need of
ban of foreign software for it, they just did it. That how it should be,
but it's more like exception than a rule, and it's really hard to make
all Russia work that way.
The problem is not in Russian companies making money on free software,
but doing this in corrupt way and with GPL violations. If they can do it
without that, this would be good.

Ivan Markin:
GPL doesn't need special regulation, it should work by-design
everywhere. Russian civil code even mention free licenses specially
(article 1286.1), so there is full legal basis, although I can't
remember any cases when that article was used in court (probably there
was none).
There is semi-opensource GNU/Linux distribution called Astra Linux based
on Debian and used by Russian govt that violates GPL by not providing
source codes to their KDE3-based DE
 (funny that Astra Linux was
created specially for govt decree about moving state agencies to the
free software).
There is proprietary OS MSVS based on RedHat used in military which not
only violate GPL by not providing source codes, but even removed most of
copyright notices.
etc., etc.

Russia is just active as US on spying on it's own citizens, if not more,
yes, in the name of the same "national interests", although in this case
it seems to be more about money.
A kind of way to bypass that already found by Eset, they just partner
with Russian company and sell the same product as Russian-origin. Of
course this means that price for Eset products will be higher for
authorities and money will leave Russian budget for no reason.
Also Russian analogs which has no way to compete with foreign software
because of quality and price now can survive only by selling their shit
to the government.
And if you thought that opensource will take place of foreign
proprietary software, it's not true. Only in the form of proprietary
Russian product using some GPL/etc. codebase in violation of these licenses.
Corruption in Russia is very real and strong.

tl;dr Roman Zakharov, Russian journalist and activist, tried to sue
Russian government since 2003 for intercepting his mobile telephone
communications and the Russian laws on surveillance as unconstitutional.
He failed and then went to the European Court of Human Rights, which
ruled that Russian laws violate Article 8 of ECHR and forced Russia to
pay 40,000 euro of compensation.
Here is the text It also has a good review of Russian laws about surveillance.

@_subject: Somebody logged into Telegram accounts of some Russian opposition activists 
Russian activists Georgy Alburov (member of Anti-corruption Foundation)
and Oleg Kozlovsky (member of Solidarnost movement) found their Telegram
accounts accessed from same NY IP address 162.247.72.27 (which is Tor
exit relay running by The Calyx Institute
) using telegram-cli. They did not have two-factor authentication
enabled (Telegram by default uses one-time passwords received by SMS,
but you can also enable "two-factor authentication" which is asking a
password when you try to login with new device) and they didn't received
the SMS message, so it's looks like SS7 attack. Russian government known
for it's exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities (and those are not really
vulnerabilities which can be easily fixed, those vuls exists because SS7
was designed that way).
MTS, telecom provider used by Alburov and Kozlovsky, commented that SMS
receiving was disabled on their accounts for some time.
I also have some evidence that Russian authorities uses same method for
logging into Facebook accounts (Facebook also have a feature called
"one-time password"  which
allows to send SMS with text "otp" to Facebook number and receive a code
which is enough to login into Facebook).
SS7 designed such way so this is not required for attacked to be in same
country as you. It's not required for your telecom provider to
cooperate. All you need is an access to SS7. Security services have it,
private spies have it, and you can have it: there is plenty of companies
selling SS7 access.
So if you use Telegram, enable two-factor authentification.
If you use Facebook, turn on login approvals
If you using any service which allows you to login just with code
received by SMS, find out a way to turn off this or stop using this service.
If you thinking about such feature in your service, please don't do so.

Russia and charged with extremism.
Here is news report about his arrest
From his Tor exit node user with nickname Airat Basharov posted some
messages on sysadmins.ru website. Russian investigators alleged that
this messages contains a call to mass riots and terrorism. Messages were
posted from different IPs in different countries (probably another exit
nodes), and only one was posted from Bogatov's IP. After Bogatov's
arrest, Airat Basharov continue to post messages.
