I actually hate to point this out, but having access to something that "looks like" a raw entropy source proves nothing. Given a design for a hardware RNG, with a characterization of its biases, I could straightforwardly take a stream generated by AES in counter mode with a 32-bit counter and do a kind of reverse distillation to make it look like the output from such a hardware RNG. Then, if the adversary knows what software is used to distill the entropy (and the AES key), the game is still over.

You misstated this. It's breakable if the *redundancy* of the traffic is larger than the key length.

Even under the much-relaxed export laws of the US, deriving spreading information cryptographically is a prohibited export. Which isn't to say it is not a good idea.
