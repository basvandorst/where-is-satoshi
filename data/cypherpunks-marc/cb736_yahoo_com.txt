To me this has nothing to do with "What are you afraid of?" Each of us have=

a bank robbery with and have 100% confidence that not one word of the conve=

 do that, with public key cryptography, which needs to be standard. It is b=

 of helping us know that our encryption can not be broken.

Thanks to all for replying.
Well, I try not to get caught in the dragnet. Besides, I have no special
threat model or fear.
But, the situation could change quickly in certain situations without
your intention.
For example, I want to talk to political activists, I would like to
discuss with them, no matter if I share their views or not. This could
easily make you interesting for certain people. Sometimes just talking
to certain people could make you suspicious.
And this is my concern.
Is a mobile device safe to use for "sensitive" discussions?
In my view and recent events suggest you can become a target, although
you are just a small number. Just talking to people could cause this.
If I listen to the discussion in this thread, a mobile device is not
adequate at all to protect your data in case of a targetted attack.
I guess, the only safe way would be to use an offline device for storing
data and a second device for online communication. And a third device
may be necessary. There are devices, that connect with bluetooth to your
smartphone and do all all the encryption totally encapsulated in its own
little box.
I don=B4t have any current need for such steps, but want to know what is
the current state in security.

It also has to be a hollow claim. To actually "deanonymize" someone would m=

t identify one client that visited one website. And how many clients were y=

it for everyone.
about:tor starts out by saying "Tor is NOT all you need to browse anonymous=

Basically we know that Tor is pretty robust, and yes it is being improved. =

 no one making a list of my searches and sending me targeted advertising, w=
hich is very offensive. But others have much more serious reasons for using=
 Tor.

This actually depends on what to mean by "Tor". If just the network =
level part, then yes. But tor project also provides and promotes TBB, =
which attempts to prevent various client side exploits and web app =
attacks, but apparently can't prevent all of them. If tor project went =
one step further, and developed security-by-isolation approach (using =
virtual machines, like Whonix does), this could prevent practically all =
client side exploits. And pretty much the only way user could be =
deanoned is if he himself typed in his personal information, or logged =
into some service shared with other identities.
