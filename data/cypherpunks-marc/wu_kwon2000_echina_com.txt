@_subject: Advise me what to do 
Dear friend,
My name is Mr Wu kwon from Korea and I would like you to guide me through
the most viable investment opportunities in your country. Alternatively, I
can invest in your line of business if you are interested and if your line
of business is viable.
I am one of the defectors from the north and I am currently residing in
South Korea. I have been in this country for sometime now. Before defecting
from the North, I was into currency exchange business and I was always
travelling to other parts of Asia and Europe and during that period, I was
able to move out my funds and deposit it in a bank in Europe.
I want to invest these funds in your country with your help and advice
because we are being treated as foreigners here. A lot of defectors now go
to Canada or the United States and some parts of Europe to live.
For more details, please see the following websites;
I want you to send me a complete breakdown of the investment opportunities
in your country and also let me know what exactly I need to do to enable you
invest the funds for me in your country.
If interested, you will have to provide an account for receiving the
investment funds. I will then come over to your country after you receive
the funds and work out the investment plans with you.
After I hear from you and find out the best investment business you can
introduce to me, I will tell you how much is involved.
I will expect your response together with your contact details, preferably
your private telephone number so that I can discuss further and additional
Reply through my private email address.
Regards and God Bless Mr. Wu Kwon
