Yeah, DDG is not bad, though before using DDG I used Google=
 quite a lot, and I noticed there were many results missing. I am doing aca=
demic research, and I noticed that Google gave a far better result queries =
than DDG did (by better I mean complete), I guess the reason for this is be=
cause DDG's crawler hasn't crawled as much as Google has, so the sw=
itch to search.disconnet.me was great, since I can literally Google/DDG thr=
ough their service. Another reason (correct me if I am wrong), but Tor Brow=
ser uses search.disconnect by default too. I guess that makes a double chec=
k for "verified" and automatically convinced me to do the switch &
8211; I don't have time to search for alternatives at the moment.On December 1, 2015 at 10:10 AM rysiek <rysi=

That's true.=
 However, that's still better than Google or Bing, which don'te=

 "some guys on the Internets said that forrealz the WHOIS showed An=

tion in Benghazi and Langley, am I rite?I do have no particular rea=

level of proof for registration address adjacent to Naval Academy does =
indeed prove nothing. Now, if that's true, probably somebody else dug <=

ss that's why I consider DDG an obvious honeypot. YMMV.Even if, not worse than Google or Bing. And they even sport a Tor Hidde=
