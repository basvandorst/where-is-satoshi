What kind of argument do you think was used by the senator's colleagues
and industry lobbyists in order to defeat the proposal?
Clearly, if you had read the paper, then you would know that it is
about encryption and authentication, and only tangentially GNU-Darwin,
which is mentioned for credibility and example purposes.  One also
wonders if your assessment of the Washington events surrounding the
post-911 encryption proposals is complete or accurate.  It appears to me
that the White House was unwilling to expend political capital on the
authentication schemes of the profiteers, which were contrary to the
national security interests.  Presumably the congress was swayed by
similar arguments in the days following the 911 attacks.

enthusiastic about the prospect of repulsive violent counter-action,
which would actually be counter-productive in my opinion.  It is the

the actions of the US administration.  Anyway, I haven't been lurking for more that a few weeks, so I'm sorry

What were you doing on 9/11?  I was in the act of packaging our first
build of GnuPG for the Distribution when the planes hit.  It took me a
couple of days to clear my head abit and write the GNU-Darwin encryption
position paper.  When a drumbeat for post-9/11 encryption bans started
in the US Congress the very day after the attack, I wrote faster and
got help from smart people on the "Free Dmitry" list and elsewhere. Any remarks about any of this?
IMHO, it is exactly this kind of commentary which scuttled an attack
on free encryption software in the wake of the attack.  Moreover, the
monolith authentication schemes were also laid to rest or driven
underground, despite the fact that certain profiteering
vendor/stakeholders had inside access in Washington.  It might have
been a very different Internet today.
Most of the commentary about the paper has been positive, except for
some criticism of pursuing private keys with warrants.  Gosh, I think my
head was not as clear as I thought on that point, a fact that time
and experience has fortunately remedied.  ;-}  Anyway, all comments
