Is the CFRG co-chair the only person in the CFRG who has associations,
proclaimed or covert, with an organization intent on undermining the
standards process?  I seriously doubt it.  Then why trust anything
from any part of the IETF?  Because it is an open process with input
from a worldwide community.  That open process provides the resilience
against attack.
Take it as a challenge, is the IETF smarter than NSA or any other
organization with ulterior motives?  Can the IETF make sound technical
judgments based on written documents?  If you don't believe this is
possible, then by all means, start the purges.  Otherwise, step up to
the plate, be part of the evaluation-on-the-merits process, and choose
leaders based on their competence and not on their employment.
