Through the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative, we are
working with agencies to reduce the overall number of external Federal

Wrong.  The quote is from section 2.10 of RFC 793
  TCP implementations will follow a general principle of robustness:  be

Things have changed since 1981.  Being liberal in what you accept from
others on the Internet now gets you pwned.

Not all that many years ago I worked with a most excellent Security
Officer.  He was at my cube one day and noticed that someone had left
their PC unlocked and logged into the email system.  I suggested that
he send an mildly embarrassing email from their account & he said "No,
that wouldn't be right."
Up to that point I hadn't thought of pranks as unethical behavior or
an abuse of trust..  but I realized that he was right.
I guess that's my answer to "but everyone else is doing it."  It's not
your server, you do not have permission to scan their machine.  The
people that deserve respect will get permission first.  The people
that don't, won't.

Thank you.  I haven't been keeping up with Tor & don't know who is
part of the team vs. invidudual contributor any more.
Which I would agree is a desirable goal.  As long as it's "working
with" instead of "dictating to."

I tried to stay away from "legal" and "illegal" mainly because there
is no universal agreement on what is/isn't "legal".  Arguing
legalities with people in who-knows-what part of the world seems like
it would be just a waste of time
You haven't cleared it with me.
I don't know you, I haven't given you permission to do anything with
my machine other than relay Tor traffic.  It seems to me that my only
reasonable option is to consider a scan as a precursor to an attack.
I have.  Please consider the idea that just because "everybody else is
doing it" doesn't make it right.
I *should* be happy?!!  There is so much wrong with that attitude ..
with your telling me how I *should* feel about you taking unwelcome
actions against my property being right up at the top of the list.
Super.  So in addition to deciding how I *should* feel, now _you_ get
to decide my system's security posture?  Not in this lifetime.  And I
suspect the tor network would lose a lot of servers if they're
required to allow your "free security audit, without any illegal
Go re-read my msg.  Scanning my relay got you blacklisted.  That
hardly seems like the attitude of someone that doesn't care about the
Security of their systems
You probably wouldn't like the suggestion I have for you...
No it isn't.
We seem to have a fundamental disagreement.  If I provide a service to
anyone on the Internet, that does not imply I've given permission for
anyone to to do anything to that server.
Agreed, there isn't much that I can do to stop anyone from attempting
anything - which is why I took my relay down.  People like you decide
that public resources are their own personal play-toys and do whatever
they feel like with, or to, them.
What part of the concept "your behavior is indistinguishable from a
Tor unfriendly person" are you having trouble grasping?
The problem is that I don't know you, I don't know your intentions,
and I haven't given you permission to do a security audit, free or
otherwise, on my machine.  You need to GET PERMISSION FIRST or you're
behaving exactly like those "Tor unfriendly person" you mentioned.

Which is why I stopped running a relay - waaaay too many people poking
at my machine.  In retrospect I was probably just incredibly naive,
but when I put up a tor relay I was expecting to just relay tor
traffic.  I did not sign up to be the target of any wannabe pen
The difference being that enterprise security monitoring systems are
monitoring *enterprise* systems.  Tor exits and relays do not belong
to you; you have no right (certainly the ability, but NOT the right)
to run pen tests on those machines.
Absolutely brilliant.  Someone donates to your cause and, if they
don't come up to your standards, you do your best to ensure they get
pwned instead of just dropping them from the donor list.
It seems to me the only legitimate "do something" available to the Tor
community would be to drop the server from the list of tor nodes.
It wouldn't be hard to set up, but absent an agreement with the owners
to allow scanning, how long do you thing it would last?  I kept adding
IPs to my blacklist until I got tired of it & turned the relay off.
(no, I didn't allow scanning my machine.  But I did log all attempts.
Blacklisted addresses got totally blocked)

I'm just pointing out that the NSA is a global passive adversary.  My
guess is that Tor's ability to royally fuck Orwellian tactical
planning by the NSA is minimal, but it's possible we have different
definitions of "royally fuck" :)

You should take another look at the docs - eg:
   Indefensible Attacks
      Tor Attacks
        Attacks which Tor cannot defend against, like a global passive
adversary or traffic confirmation attacks, are obviously outside the
scope of even the most robust Tor implementation.

from only a NARA computer you're pretty much SOL..
Not at all weird; it seems pretty effective to me.  Over 11 million
pages "released" and only 10% _printed_ (as in someone would have to
scan the page to get it back into electronic format) sounds like a
pretty good access control system for something you don't really want

I'm wondering how well it's going to go over with the USG that Brit
spies can legally hack US computers.  Not that I don't trust The Reg
or anything, but I wanted to see how well their story matched up with
the ruling.  Guess what?  The PDF of the ruling has gone missing :)
The Tribunal is required by law (RIPA section 69(6)(b)) not to
disclose material provided to it which would threaten the national
interest, national security, operations against serious crime or any
functions of the intelligence agencies. However, it has concluded that
publication of a ruling on a point of law or on the basis of assumed
facts does not compromise these areas or the âneither confirm nor
denyâ principle by which the intelligence agencies operate. It seeks
where possible to publish its judgments.
I guess somebody decided it was best not to publish that particular ruling.
