Company Profi|e:
BI0GENERICS LTD is a domestic oi| and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a techno|ogy |eader in todays Energy market. The companys shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic Oi| and Gas is Bushs  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principal business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, held significant positions in biotechno|ogy, fiber optics and other techno|ogy ventures that management be|ieved could propel shareholder va|ue.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oi| & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation  an oil and gas techno|ogy leader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natural.
The Companys other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to fi|e a Form 10 in the immediate future.
