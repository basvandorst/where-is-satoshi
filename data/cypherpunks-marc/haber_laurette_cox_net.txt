Hi Cypherpunks, Perhaps the simplest first line treatment for back and neck pain is rest, which reduces the natural pressure of upper body weight on the spine.  In the past, it was common for physicians to prescribe two weeks of bed rest for back pain.  We now know that three to four days of rest are optimal. After this period, movement and exercise are more important to relieving pain symptoms and to prevent loss of muscle tone and flexibility. However, strenuous work should be avoided for two to three weeks while healing occurs. As long as there is no numbness or weakness in the legs or arms, this process can be completed without undergoing any special diagnostic testing. If the back pain has not resolved within six weeks, consult your physician.
We believe ordering medication should be as simple as ordering anything else on the Internet: Private, secure, and easy.
