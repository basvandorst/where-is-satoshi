@_subject: !!!EARN BIG $$$ POSTING GIO FLIERS!!! 
Enterprizes Dept  Box 2028 Gilbert AZ 85229 (Print-off, fill-out, and mail this form today! Even if you already post some GIO items, you need to fill in and snail-mail this form to acquire the others for your bags.  Fliers come, professionally-
produced, from West-End Printing [with precut pull-off tabs]--- except for occasional interum-supply shipments.) If you haven't been posting GIO products, then you don't know what monsterous checks you've been missing!  Students routinely strip all GIO products' fliers bare of tabs.  Almost every time you return you have to replace or replinish. Here's a run-down of what you could be posting soon: (1) FUTUREQUEST. A proven, 13-year track-record winner! Top-notch opportunity offer--- a complete money-making kit designed for students. Pays $7 a sale! (2) ESQUIRE. Somewhat newer, this opportunity has a slightly different slant--- to appeal to those with other perceptions. Developed by other originaters, this complements without duplicating FQ. Several years old now.  Pays $6 a sale. (3) BETTER SOLUTIONS. Another angle on the same take, true--- but this was engineered quite differently. Aims at another sort of audience-- though still accomodates a fair percentage of those favored by FQ & ESQUIRE. Flier is totally different--- seems like something from an alien univese to FQ & ESQUIRE. Also several years old now. Pays $7 a sale. (4) CREDIT-REPAIR KIT. Actually, part of the BS-offer--- the main component designed for students to post off-campus. Your flier looks different, is student-oriented, for on-campus posting. Some students may post their version some on-campus though. Pays $6 a sale. (5) PINK PLEASURES. A guide to legal Nevada bordelloes! Will have guys fighting for the library or dorm computer to order their copy first.  Obviously not good for religious schools--- but the discrete posting flier can be reasonably hung just about relatively anywhere else. Pays $7 a sale. (6) INTERNET-USER CASH-GENERATOR. About a year old now, this one is really starting to pick up. Mostly details hundreds of internet-
programs, with free sign-up, that students can use to generate payments and such to their accounts. Posting fliers proclaim Internet Users/Surfers Wanted. Pays $6 a sale. (7) INTERNET INCOME OFFER. Mainly concerns free sign-up internet programs for making money off the net. Some are a real doozy. A sure hot-seller. Pays $6 a sale. (8) CAPITOL ONE CREDIT-CARD. One of the greatest additions to the posting-industry ever. Totally unlike the card-app CAPITOL ONE now in your bag. Are you sick of the current CO thing (from CCCC or ACM)--- with uncoded apps good only for a few paticular institutions?  
Well,frustrate no more. These CapOne fliers can be posted at all universities, colleges, vocational-technical schools or anyplace you want to post them. Students simply enter a url referral-link, with your unique agent-code embedded within, into any handy computer. They complete the application online--- and within a minute are denied or approved. With every approval, you accumulate $9. Students have literally been snatching these fliers from reps' hands before said reps can staple them onto bulletin-boards! This is no hype: it is ABSOLUTELY true--- and you can verrify it by writing to Dan McFarland at divmkt He will set you straight!  We kid thee not!  Pays $9 per approval! (9) DIRT-CHEAP! Scholarship-search. Yes, it's back! Since all but the last step is done via the net, the cost for students is rock-bottom---
for searches from multiple data-bases. Even pays the same $5.50 a sale like the old Student Services deal--- maybe more later-on. (10) AUTO-INSURANCE.  Again, students take a tab, type a url, embedded with your code, into the address-slot, click Enter. Such takes them to the site, where they complete a form for a quote.  Your account is automatically credited.  Pays $1 or more per quote.  
(11) AMERICAN-EXPRESS CREDIT-CARD OFFER.  Essentially, this works the same as the CapOne item. Are you sick of being allowed to post Amex apps from APM only at certain universities in the small, paticular area(s) Kerry or Lance sees fit to condescendingly code you for--- because those are the only places your apps will be paid on when they are mailed-in?  Well, fret no more.  These Amex fliers can be posted at ANY upper school--- and you are eligable for payment for any of those approvals from anywhere.  Usually pays comperable to CapOne.
(12) TRAFFIC TICKETS.  A guide to fighting traffic-tickets in court.  
Good for off-campus posting as well as on-campus posting.  Pays $5 or more a sale.
(13) TEXTBOOKS.  Huge selection of new and used.  Dirt-cheap prices.  
Pays a percentage of all sales.  Pure potential dynamite!
(14) THINGS-FROM-ANOTHER-WORLD.  Primarily comic-books.  Humonegous range of publshers and titles.  Also: CDs, maybe sometimes videos.  
Pays on a percentage of sale basis.
(15) NEXTCARD.  Yet another postable-anywhere credit-card.  And we mean anywhere--- on (any) campus or off!  Essentially the same deal as with CapOne and Amex.  Pays similarly.

Hello Friend and Job seeker,
     Are you looking to be your own boss, interested in creating and controlling your own work hours/schedule, and working from your comfortable home?
     How about making more money in a week than you currently make in a month?  Do you want to stop struggling for the low wages you are currently earning?

     My method will even show you how to get the envelopes with the addresses and stamps already on them.  This means, no addressing of envelopes or licking of stamps is required!  Simply fill the envelopes with my sales materials, put them in the mail box and you& get $3 for every single one...Guaranteed!  I have taken the measures to make things as simple and easy as possible for you.
                      DON'T RISK MISSING OUT!
     I am seeking a limited number of home workers, and I will stop accepting orders as soon as I get enough home workers in your area.  To avoid losing out on the chance to be one of our home workers, order your "$3 per Enveloped System".
     The cost of this  system is only $55.  Included is everything you need to start making money immediately with easy step by step instructions and supplies to get you started.  And remember, after stuffing only 21 envelopes you& have earned more than your investment back.

@_subject: !!!EARN BIG $$$ POSTING GIO FLIERS!!! 
GIO College Posting Enterprizes Dept  Box 2028 Gilbert AZ 85229 USA
Welcome to the wonderful world of college-posting!!!  Unless you are: (1) independently-wealthy, (2) are an entrenched execcutive with extensive company stock-options, or (3) have a steady, permanent, gravy civil-service position--- you may do well to visualize that you have just stumbled into the equivilant of a gold-mine!  In this relatively lucrative field, you can indeed fulfill all those dreams about essentially working for yourself: on your own schedule, where you please, as much or as little as you want to!  You can persue it as a full time occupation--- or just dabble at it on the side-line while working a regular job. . .if you are fortunate to have such.
All it consist of is walking around college and university campuses and posting fliers and such on convinent bulletin-boards and the like.  About the only items you need is a stapler and staples (and maybe a roll of tape).  You simply stick materials up on the boards for students to see.  For each product that you post fliers for, you are assigned a unique agent code-number--- which goes on that paticular flier's tabs.  When inquiries (and so sales) result they are tracked acording to your code, and added to your account.  In sum: Fliers are shipped to you free: you post them. . . responses come in--- and you accumulate commissions.  Checks are mailed either forthnightly or monthly.  Yes indeed: make quick, easy cash posting these tear-strip fliers--- as simple as that!  And no--- you don't have to send us any money: we send you money instead! A few pointers:
GENERAL: If your campuses are like many others across the country, should you just slap up fliers in any old way any old where at any old time--- well, don't expect any real worthwhile results.  Done in this fashion, when you put up a flier tonight, tomorrow morning it will be plastered over with ads for fraternity parties, upcoming club-
meetings, bands looking for bass-players, and so-on and so-
forth. "The only way to find a clean place to post at the University of Florida is to light a match," jokes Mike Eisenberg, president of Collegiate Promotions International, a postering company in Tampa, Florida.  Such is because most people posting bulletin-boards are unsophisticated and haphazard in how they poster: they just grab any old stapler, copies of their flier, and roam around plastering on whim, paying little real attention to what they are doing.  "You don't have to be absolutely professional (though that sure helps) to be effective, but you need to be efficient," says Stephen Crockett, president of Mid-South Marketing in Tennessee.  Just remember--- if you are: (1) courteous to other regular posting critters that use your boards consistantly, (2) keep track of where you put your posters, and (3) monitor boards regularly--- well, then, you can attract a lot of attention (and so responses) through your flier-
posting eforts. Putting up fliers, posters, and other materials in the right manner around campus can be well worth your time and effort.  It will prove to make a vast difference in your checks--- say: $100, if you do--- vs $10, if you don't!  DON'T HOG THE BOARDS! Never put more than one (or two, if massive space is available) posters/fliers on each bulletin board.  You'll acquire a bad image and create hard feelings among student-groups and others if you blanket the boards with your materials. If you have variations of a given fleir (with significent differences), then one (or possibly two) of each might be admissable--- depending on size-of-board(s) and other conditions.
 REMOVE ANY OUTDATED POSTERS/FLIERS YOU FIND FIRST (IN MOST CASES)
Usually, don't wait weeks or months to jerk down any present items with past-dates on them. "At one school, I found posters that were 18 months old, towards thirty layers thick," Mid-South's Crockett says. "If it looks messy, people will poster over top of you. A lot of students aren't going to check before they post you over." At some places, the situation is different: The University of Texas at Austin has developed an innovative postering technique that has helped prevent a lot of unsightly trash around campus. "Students used to put posters anyplace, on trees, trash cans, basically anything that didn't move," says Jerry Harrison, UT's manager of landscape services. "But a few years ago, we built some kiosks which are barrel-
shaped, made out of redwood. Every six inches, we have these large elastic bands that are permanently attached. Students can slip the posters under it. They work great."  But with most schools nothing so inovative exists--- and keeping your materials prominately displayed remains a constant, on-going battle.
 GENERALLY, WALLS ARE A NO-NO.
Nearly all colleges and universities across the nation (Canada too)  
prohibit clubs from sticking posters to interior or exterior classroom walls. If a surface has dry-wall (sheet-rock, as it is called) behind it--- well, then, taping or stapling posters to such will eventually peal off the paint. . , or possibly tear off the top layer of the dry-wall when removed!  If a wall is concrete or cinder-
block (especially unpainted) then you have more leeway.  If glass, probably pasting there is okay--- in unpainted: if painted, it is likely to take off the paint when removed: nor big deal, possibly, but to be avoided if possible.  If wood, also exercise caution: paint won't come off nearly as easily as with glass--- but the possibility still exists; if the place already hass spots where paint has come-
off with old fliers removed in the past, then such happening with yours won't matter much though.  Some walls, actually, are made from the same stuff as most bulletin-boards: a layer of thin corogated-
like rubber-matting over light (usually pine) sheet-wood--- which permit easily stapling; may such spots you'll find already have things affixed to them.  Above all, watch what glue you use: avoid model air-plane, rubber-cement, Elmers, 3M, Epoxy, etc; instead, employ so-called glue-sticks--- available at most stores like Staples.  Such are actually composed of wax, with some mild chemical adhesive mixed in--- and so hold reasonably well, while possessing little destructive potential.
 CAUTION WITH STAPLE-GUNS
Heavy-duty staple-guns (using standard thick staple-gun staples) are a bozo no-no because they tear up the boards. Instead, use an office stapler, such as an Arrow stapler, or a "light-duty" staple gun: such is a power instrument, but uses regular-style staples (even if appropriately chisel-pointed).  KEEP TRACK OF THE BEST POSTING LOCATIONS Spend an hour or two going around your campus to do a bulletin board inspection: where they are, how heavily covered they are, and how well they're maintained. Keep detailed notes about your observations of each location. If possible, maintain tabs about how many students walk by the boards and note how many actually stop for a minute or two to read posters. (One time-tested option is to place posters on the backs of stall doors in restrooms. These locations are the ultimate captive audience. "Since Simmons College is all women, this works really well," says Karen Boss, a former student activities employee at Simmons. "People will always read what is in front of them." )
 CLASSROOMS VS BREEZEWAYS In classrooms, students are stuck in one place for an hour or more. If you place your posters inside classrooms on the small bulletin boards near the doors (or whereever available), you'll get the whole class's attention. "If you're looking for maximum exposure, breezeways may be best. But classrooms are better for reaching specific majors," Crockett says. "You may get over two-hundred kids through a classroom in a day, but you may have 2,000 students walk down a hallway, which is way more competition, but also a lot more traffic."  BEST TIMES TO POSTER Go late at night or early in the morning. "We try to get out at 4 or 5 a.m. and leave enough of the board exposed so that anyone posting later will likely leave some of our posters," says Charles Grapski of the Independent Student Coalition at the University of Florida. "Sometimes it's a chore, but it can be fun."  Nights may work better at some schools (or at least for paticular buildings.  
Sometimes weekends are about the only time to get into some places during the whole semester.
 WHERE TO POSTER ON A BOARD Try to put your posters at eye level and remember than everyone isn't the same height. Some people are taller than others, while others use wheelchairs.  Posting in a board's middle may well usually get you posted over quickly.  Tops or bottoms may work better in the long-
run.  Vetran (35 years) New England posterer Ricahrd Paris prefers to line his materils up-and-down the side ob boardds--- which makes some sense: as then they can be covered over from onley one direction, instead of three. "One of the most unique means of attracting attention that I've observed on our campus is when groups place a `Burma Shave' type display on stairs," says Ken Peress of Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. "You can't miss them when you start up (or come down) the steps." Some stair-wells have boards for easy stapling.  If not, then fliers taped to the wall of various landing-
levels can work wonders if they stay up reasonably long.  WHAT IF SOMEONE POSTERS OVER YOU? If someone slaps their posters over yours, remove theirs. You have that right. But knowing how much you hate it when this happens to you, don't perpetuate the problem. That's precisely why you shouldn't post over someone else's fliers.  IN SOME CASES, SCHOOL POSTING-STAMPS MAY BE APPLICABLE Some schools are annal-retentative aobut what is psoted in their environs--- or at least some paticualr buildings on a campus may operate like that.  The psychologically-disadvantaged creatures running these places may first require that all posters and flyers be approved by the dean's office or by student-activities office or some-
such nonsense: that is, stamped with an official seal--- and they may well be adverse with stamping many items they have some deranges beef against, such as your paticular fliers. "At our school, students have to get their posters stamped at each building, which has control of how its posters are distributed," says Cynthia Kane, assistant director of Student Activities at Seton Hall University in New York. And she's just referring to school-related things.  So at some places, where your stuff isn't stampable, and won't stay up worth squat unstamped--- they may well not be worth posting. . . at least in the traditional mode.  In such cases, taping them to soft-drink machine sides, in in side pay-phone stations (not owned by the school) may be applicable.
CONCLUSION: You can get better attention and thus response if you develop a strategy about when, where, and how to display posters and fliers on campus to get the most exposure possible.  Simple as that! Print-off, fill-out, and mail this form today! Even if you already post some GIO items, you need to fill in and snail-mail this form to acquire the others for your bags. Fliers come, professionally-
produced, from West-End Printing (with precut pull-off tabs)--- except for occasional interum-supply shipments.

Welcome to the wonderful world of college-posting!!!
Unless you are: (1) independently-wealthy, (2) are an
 entrenched execcutive with extensive company stock-
options, or (3) have a steady, permanent, gravy civil-
service position--- you may do well to visualize that
 you have just stumbled into the equivilant of a gold-
mine!  In this relatively lucrative field, you can indeed fulfill all those dreams about essentially working for yourself: on your own schedule, where you
please, as much or as little as you want to!  You can
persue it as a full time occupation--- or just dabble
at it on the side-line while working a regular job. . . if you are fortunate to have such.

convinent bulletin-boards and the like.  About the only
items you need is a stapler and staples (and maybe a
roll of tape).  You simply stick materials up on the
boards for students to see.  For each product that you
post fliers for, you are assigned a unique agent code-
number--- which goes on that paticular flier's tabs.
When inquiries (and so sales) result they are tracked
acording to your code, and added to your account.  In sum: Fliers are shipped to you free: you post them. . .
responses come in--- and you accumulate commissions.
Checks are mailed either forthnightly or monthly.  Yes
indeed: make quick, easy cash posting these tear-strip
fliers--- as simple as that!  And no--- you don't have

"The only way to find a clean place to post at the University of Florida is to light a match," jokes Mike Eisenberg, president of Collegiate Promotions International, a postering company in Tampa, Florida.  Such is because most people posting bulletin-boards are unsophisticated and haphazard in how they poster: they just grab any old stapler, copies of their flier, and roam around plastering on whim, paying little real attention to what they are doing.  "You don't have to be absolutely professional (though that sure helps) to be effective, but you need to be efficient," says Stephen Crockett, president of Mid-South Marketing in Tennessee.  Just remember--- if you are: (1) courteous to other regular posting critters that use your boards consistantly, (2) keep track of where you put your posters, and (3) monitor boards regularly--- well, then, you can attract a lot of attention (and so responses) through your flier-
posting efforts. Putting up fliers, posters, and other materials in the right manner around campus can be well worth your time and exertion.  It will prove to make a vast difference in your checks--- say: $100, if you do--- vs $10, if you don't!  DON'T HOG THE BOARDS! Never put more than one (or two, if massive space is available) posters/fliers on each bulletin board.  You'll acquire a bad image and create hard feelings among student-groups and others if you blanket the boards with your materials. If you have variations of a given fleir (with significent differences), then one (or possibly two) of each might be admissable--- depending on size-of-board(s) and other conditions.
 REMOVE ANY OUTDATED POSTERS/FLIERS YOU FIND FIRST (IN MOST CASES)
Usually, don't wait weeks or months to jerk down any present items with past-dates on them. "At one school, I found posters that were 18 months old, towards thirty layers thick," Mid-South's Crockett says. "If it looks messy, people will poster over top of you. A lot of students aren't going to check before they post you over." At some places, the situation is different: The University of Texas at Austin has developed an innovative postering technique that has helped prevent a lot of unsightly trash around campus. "Students used to put posters anyplace, on trees, trash cans, basically anything that didn't move," says Jerry Harrison, UT's manager of landscape services. "But a few years ago, we built some kiosks which are barrel-
shaped, made out of redwood. Every six inches, we have these large elastic bands that are permanently attached. Students can slip the posters under it. They work great."  But with most schools nothing so inovative exists--- and keeping your materials prominately displayed remains a constant, on-going battle.
 GENERALLY, WALLS ARE A NO-NO.
Nearly all colleges and universities across the nation (Canada too)  
prohibit clubs from sticking posters to interior or exterior classroom walls. If a surface has dry-wall (sheet-rock, as it is called) behind it--- well, then, taping or stapling posters to such will eventually peal off the paint. . , or possibly tear off the top layer of the dry-wall when removed!  If a wall is concrete or cinder-
block (especially unpainted) then you have more leeway.  If glass, probably pasting there is okay--- in unpainted: if painted, it is likely to take off the paint when removed: nor big deal, possibly, but to be avoided if possible.  If wood, also exercise caution: paint won't come off nearly as easily as with glass--- but the possibility still exists; if the place already hass spots where paint has come-
off with old fliers removed in the past, then such happening with yours won't matter much though.  Some walls, actually, are made from the same stuff as most bulletin-boards: a layer of thin corogated-
like rubber-matting over light (usually pine) sheet-wood--- which permit easily stapling; may such spots you'll find already have things affixed to them.  Above all, watch what glue you use: avoid model air-plane, rubber-cement, Elmers, 3M, Epoxy, etc; instead, employ so-called glue-sticks--- available at most stores like Staples.  Such are actually composed of wax, with some mild chemical adhesive mixed in--- and so hold reasonably well, while possessing little destructive potential.
 CAUTION WITH STAPLE-GUNS
Heavy-duty staple-guns (using standard thick staple-gun staples) are a bozo no-no because they tear up the boards. Instead, use an office stapler, such as an Arrow stapler, or a "light-duty" staple gun: such is a power instrument, but uses regular-style staples (even if appropriately chisel-pointed).  KEEP TRACK OF THE BEST POSTING LOCATIONS Spend an hour or two going around your campus to do a bulletin board inspection: where they are, how heavily covered they are, and how well they're maintained. Keep detailed notes about your observations of each location. If possible, maintain tabs about how many students walk by the boards and note how many actually stop for a minute or two to read posters. (One time-tested option is to place posters on the backs of stall doors in restrooms. These locations are the ultimate captive audience. "Since Simmons College is all women, this works really well," says Karen Boss, a former student activities employee at Simmons. "People will always read what is in front of them." )
 CLASSROOMS VS BREEZEWAYS In classrooms, students are stuck in one place for an hour or more. If you place your posters inside classrooms on the small bulletin boards near the doors (or whereever available), you'll get the whole class's attention. "If you're looking for maximum exposure, breezeways may be best. But classrooms are better for reaching specific majors," Crockett says. "You may get over two-hundred kids through a classroom in a day, but you may have 2,000 students walk down a hallway, which is way more competition, but also a lot more traffic."  BEST TIMES TO POSTER Go late at night or early in the morning. "We try to get out at 4 or 5 a.m. and leave enough of the board exposed so that anyone posting later will likely leave some of our posters," says Charles Grapski of the Independent Student Coalition at the University of Florida. "Sometimes it's a chore, but it can be fun."  Nights may work better at some schools (or at least for paticular buildings.  
Sometimes weekends are about the only time to get into some places during the whole semester.
 WHERE TO POSTER ON A BOARD Try to put your posters at eye level and remember than everyone isn't the same height. Some people are taller than others, while others use wheelchairs.  Posting in a board's middle may well usually get you posted over quickly.  Tops or bottoms may work better in the long-
run.  Vetran (35 years) New England posterer Ricahrd Paris prefers to line his materils up-and-down the side ob boardds--- which makes some sense: as then they can be covered over from onley one direction, instead of three. "One of the most unique means of attracting attention that I've observed on our campus is when groups place a `Burma Shave' type display on stairs," says Ken Peress of Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. "You can't miss them when you start up (or come down) the steps." Some stair-wells have boards for easy stapling.  If not, then fliers taped to the wall of various landing-
levels can work wonders if they stay up reasonably long.  WHAT IF SOMEONE POSTERS OVER YOU? If someone slaps their posters over yours, remove theirs. You have that right. But knowing how much you hate it when this happens to you, don't perpetuate the problem. That's precisely why you shouldn't post over someone else's fliers.  IN SOME CASES, SCHOOL POSTING-STAMPS MAY BE APPLICABLE Some schools are annal-retentative aobut what is psoted in their environs--- or at least some paticualr buildings on a campus may operate like that.  The psychologically-disadvantaged creatures running these places may first require that all posters and flyers be approved by the dean's office or by student-activities office or some-
such nonsense: that is, stamped with an official seal--- and they may well be adverse with stamping many items they have some deranges beef against, such as your paticular fliers. "At our school, students have to get their posters stamped at each building, which has control of how its posters are distributed," says Cynthia Kane, assistant director of Student Activities at Seton Hall University in New York. And she's just referring to school-related things.  So at some places, where your stuff isn't stampable, and won't stay up worth squat unstamped--- they may well not be worth posting. . . at least in the traditional mode.  In such cases, taping them to soft-drink machine sides, in in side pay-phone stations (not owned by the school) may be applicable.
CONCLUSION: You can get better attention and thus response if you develop a strategy about when, where, and how to display posters and fliers on campus to get the most exposure possible.  Simple as that! Print-off, fill-out, and mail this form today! Even if you already post some GIO items, you need to fill in and snail-mail this form to acquire the others for your bags. Fliers come, professionally-
produced, from West-End Printing (with precut pull-off tabs)--- except for occasional interum-supply shipments.

@_subject: !!!EARN BIG $$$ POSTING GIO FLIERS!!! 
============================== START ==============================
GIO College Posting Enterprizes Dept  Box 2028 Gilbert AZ 85229 USA
Welcome to the wonderful world of college-posting!!!  Unless you are: (1) independently-wealthy, (2) are an entrenched execcutive with extensive company stock-options, or (3) have a steady, permanent, gravy civil-service position--- you may do well to visualize that you have just stumbled into the equivilant of a gold-mine!  In this relatively lucrative field, you can indeed fulfill all those dreams about essentially working for yourself: on your own schedule, where you please, as much or as little as you want to!  You can persue it as a full time occupation--- or just dabble at it on the side-line while working a regular job. . .if you are fortunate to have such.
All it consist of is walking around college and university campuses and posting fliers and such on convinent bulletin-boards and the like.  About the only items you need is a stapler and staples (and maybe a roll of tape).  You simply stick materials up on the boards for students to see.  For each product that you post fliers for, you are assigned a unique agent code-number--- which goes on that paticular flier's tabs.  When inquiries (and so sales) result they are tracked acording to your code, and added to your account.  In sum: Fliers are shipped to you free: you post them. . . responses come in--- and you accumulate commissions.  Checks are mailed either forthnightly or monthly.  Yes indeed: make quick, easy cash posting these tear-strip fliers--- as simple as that!  And no--- you don't have to send us any money: we send you money instead! A few pointers:
GENERAL: If your campuses are like many others across the country, should you just slap up fliers in any old way any old where at any old time--- well, don't expect any real worthwhile results.  Done in this fashion, when you put up a flier tonight, tomorrow morning it will be plastered over with ads for fraternity parties, upcoming club-
meetings, bands looking for bass-players, and so-on and so-
forth. "The only way to find a clean place to post at the University of Florida is to light a match," jokes Mike Eisenberg, president of Collegiate Promotions International, a postering company in Tampa, Florida.  Such is because most people posting bulletin-boards are unsophisticated and haphazard in how they poster: they just grab any old stapler, copies of their flier, and roam around plastering on whim, paying little real attention to what they are doing.  "You don't have to be absolutely professional (though that sure helps) to be effective, but you need to be efficient," says Stephen Crockett, president of Mid-South Marketing in Tennessee.  Just remember--- if you are: (1) courteous to other regular posting critters that use your boards consistantly, (2) keep track of where you put your posters, and (3) monitor boards regularly--- well, then, you can attract a lot of attention (and so responses) through your flier-
posting eforts. Putting up fliers, posters, and other materials in the right manner around campus can be well worth your time and effort.  It will prove to make a vast difference in your checks--- say: $100, if you do--- vs $10, if you don't!  DON'T HOG THE BOARDS! Never put more than one (or two, if massive space is available) posters/fliers on each bulletin board.  You'll acquire a bad image and create hard feelings among student-groups and others if you blanket the boards with your materials. If you have variations of a given fleir (with significent differences), then one (or possibly two) of each might be admissable--- depending on size-of-board(s) and other conditions.
 REMOVE ANY OUTDATED POSTERS/FLIERS YOU FIND FIRST (IN MOST CASES)
Usually, don't wait weeks or months to jerk down any present items with past-dates on them. "At one school, I found posters that were 18 months old, towards thirty layers thick," Mid-South's Crockett says. "If it looks messy, people will poster over top of you. A lot of students aren't going to check before they post you over." At some places, the situation is different: The University of Texas at Austin has developed an innovative postering technique that has helped prevent a lot of unsightly trash around campus.

Welcome to the wonderful world of college-posting!!!  Unless you are: (1) independently-wealthy, (2) are an entrenched execcutive with extensive company stock-options, or (3) have a steady, permanent, gravy civil-service position--- you may do well to visualize that you have just stumbled into the equivilant of a gold-mine!  In this relatively lucrative field, you can indeed fulfill all those dreams about essentially working for yourself: on your own schedule, where you please, as much or as little as you want to!  You can persue it as a full time occupation--- or just dabble at it on the side-line while working a regular job. . .if you are fortunate to have such.
All it consist of is walking around college and university campuses and posting fliers and such on convinent bulletin-boards and the like.  About the only items you need is a stapler and staples (and maybe a roll of tape).  You simply stick materials up on the boards for students to see.  For each product that you post fliers for, you are assigned a unique agent code-number--- which goes on that paticular flier's tabs.  When inquiries (and so sales) result they are tracked acording to your code, and added to your account.  In sum: Fliers are shipped to you free: you post them. . . responses come in--- and you accumulate commissions.  Checks are mailed either forthnightly or monthly.  Yes indeed: make quick, easy cash posting these tear-strip fliers--- as simple as that!  And no--- you don't have to send us any money: we send you money instead! A few pointers:
GENERAL: If your campuses are like many others across the country, should you just slap up fliers in any old way any old where at any old time--- well, don't expect any real worthwhile results.  Done in this fashion, when you put up a flier tonight, tomorrow morning it will be plastered over with ads for fraternity parties, upcoming club-
meetings, bands looking for bass-players, and so-on and so-
forth. "The only way to find a clean place to post at the University of Florida is to light a match," jokes Mike Eisenberg, president of Collegiate Promotions International, a postering company in Tampa, Florida.  Such is because most people posting bulletin-boards are unsophisticated and haphazard in how they poster: they just grab any old stapler, copies of their flier, and roam around plastering on whim, paying little real attention to what they are doing.  "You don't have to be absolutely professional (though that sure helps) to be effective, but you need to be efficient," says Stephen Crockett, president of Mid-South Marketing in Tennessee.  Just remember--- if you are: (1) courteous to other regular posting critters that use your boards consistantly, (2) keep track of where you put your posters, and (3) monitor boards regularly--- well, then, you can attract a lot of attention (and so responses) through your flier-
posting eforts. Putting up fliers, posters, and other materials in the right manner around campus can be well worth your time and effort.  It will prove to make a vast difference in your checks--- say: $100, if you do--- vs $10, if you don't!  DON'T HOG THE BOARDS! Never put more than one (or two, if massive space is available) posters/fliers on each bulletin board.  You'll acquire a bad image and create hard feelings among student-groups and others if you blanket the boards with your materials. If you have variations of a given fleir (with significent differences), then one (or possibly two) of each might be admissable--- depending on size-of-board(s) and other conditions.
 REMOVE ANY OUTDATED POSTERS/FLIERS YOU FIND FIRST (IN MOST CASES)
Usually, don't wait weeks or months to jerk down any present items with past-dates on them. "At one school, I found posters that were 18 months old, towards thirty layers thick," Mid-South's Crockett says. "If it looks messy, people will poster over top of you. A lot of students aren't going to check before they post you over." At some places, the situation is different: The University of Texas at Austin has developed an innovative postering technique that has helped prevent a lot of unsightly trash around campus. "Students used to put posters anyplace, on trees, trash cans, basically anything that didn't move," says Jerry Harrison, UT's manager of landscape services. "But a few years ago, we built some kiosks which are barrel-
shaped, made out of redwood. Every six inches, we have these large elastic bands that are permanently attached. Students can slip the posters under it. They work great."  But with most schools nothing so inovative exists--- and keeping your materials prominately displayed remains a constant, on-going battle.
 GENERALLY, WALLS ARE A NO-NO.
Nearly all colleges and universities across the nation (Canada too)  
prohibit clubs from sticking posters to interior or exterior classroom walls. If a surface has dry-wall (sheet-rock, as it is called) behind it--- well, then, taping or stapling posters to such will eventually peal off the paint. . , or possibly tear off the top layer of the dry-wall when removed!  If a wall is concrete or cinder-
block (especially unpainted) then you have more leeway.  If glass, probably pasting there is okay--- in unpainted: if painted, it is likely to take off the paint when removed: nor big deal, possibly, but to be avoided if possible.  If wood, also exercise caution: paint won't come off nearly as easily as with glass--- but the possibility still exists; if the place already hass spots where paint has come-
off with old fliers removed in the past, then such happening with yours won't matter much though.  Some walls, actually, are made from the same stuff as most bulletin-boards: a layer of thin corogated-
like rubber-matting over light (usually pine) sheet-wood--- which permit easily stapling; may such spots you'll find already have things affixed to them.  Above all, watch what glue you use: avoid model air-plane, rubber-cement, Elmers, 3M, Epoxy, etc; instead, employ so-called glue-sticks--- available at most stores like Staples.  Such are actually composed of wax, with some mild chemical adhesive mixed in--- and so hold reasonably well, while possessing little destructive potential.
 CAUTION WITH STAPLE-GUNS
Heavy-duty staple-guns (using standard thick staple-gun staples) are a bozo no-no because they tear up the boards. Instead, use an office stapler, such as an Arrow stapler, or a "light-duty" staple gun: such is a power instrument, but uses regular-style staples (even if appropriately chisel-pointed).  KEEP TRACK OF THE BEST POSTING LOCATIONS Spend an hour or two going around your campus to do a bulletin board inspection: where they are, how heavily covered they are, and how well they're maintained. Keep detailed notes about your observations of each location. If possible, maintain tabs about how many students walk by the boards and note how many actually stop for a minute or two to read posters. (One time-tested option is to place posters on the backs of stall doors in restrooms. These locations are the ultimate captive audience. "Since Simmons College is all women, this works really well," says Karen Boss, a former student activities employee at Simmons. "People will always read what is in front of them." )
 CLASSROOMS VS BREEZEWAYS In classrooms, students are stuck in one place for an hour or more. If you place your posters inside classrooms on the small bulletin boards near the doors (or whereever available), you'll get the whole class's attention. "If you're looking for maximum exposure, breezeways may be best. But classrooms are better for reaching specific majors," Crockett says. "You may get over two-hundred kids through a classroom in a day, but you may have 2,000 students walk down a hallway, which is way more competition, but also a lot more traffic."  BEST TIMES TO POSTER Go late at night or early in the morning. "We try to get out at 4 or 5 a.m. and leave enough of the board exposed so that anyone posting later will likely leave some of our posters," says Charles Grapski of the Independent Student Coalition at the University of Florida. "Sometimes it's a chore, but it can be fun."  Nights may work better at some schools (or at least for paticular buildings.  
Sometimes weekends are about the only time to get into some places during the whole semester.
 WHERE TO POSTER ON A BOARD Try to put your posters at eye level and remember than everyone isn't the same height. Some people are taller than others, while others use wheelchairs.  Posting in a board's middle may well usually get you posted over quickly.  Tops or bottoms may work better in the long-
run.  Vetran (35 years) New England posterer Ricahrd Paris prefers to line his materils up-and-down the side ob boardds--- which makes some sense: as then they can be covered over from onley one direction, instead of three. "One of the most unique means of attracting attention that I've observed on our campus is when groups place a `Burma Shave' type display on stairs," says Ken Peress of Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. "You can't miss them when you start up (or come down) the steps." Some stair-wells have boards for easy stapling.  If not, then fliers taped to the wall of various landing-
levels can work wonders if they stay up reasonably long.  WHAT IF SOMEONE POSTERS OVER YOU? If someone slaps their posters over yours, remove theirs. You have that right. But knowing how much you hate it when this happens to you, don't perpetuate the problem. That's precisely why you shouldn't post over someone else's fliers.  IN SOME CASES, SCHOOL POSTING-STAMPS MAY BE APPLICABLE Some schools are annal-retentative aobut what is psoted in their environs--- or at least some paticualr buildings on a campus may operate like that.  The psychologically-disadvantaged creatures running these places may first require that all posters and flyers be approved by the dean's office or by student-activities office or some-
such nonsense: that is, stamped with an official seal--- and they may well be adverse with stamping many items they have some deranges beef against, such as your paticular fliers. "At our school, students have to get their posters stamped at each building, which has control of how its posters are distributed," says Cynthia Kane, assistant director of Student Activities at Seton Hall University in New York. And she's just referring to school-related things.  So at some places, where your stuff isn't stampable, and won't stay up worth squat unstamped--- they may well not be worth posting. . . at least in the traditional mode.  In such cases, taping them to soft-drink machine sides, in in side pay-phone stations (not owned by the school) may be applicable.
CONCLUSION: You can get better attention and thus response if you develop a strategy about when, where, and how to display posters and fliers on campus to get the most exposure possible.  Simple as that! Print-off, fill-out, and mail this form today! Even if you already post some GIO items, you need to fill in and snail-mail this form to acquire the others for your bags. Fliers come, professionally-
produced, from West-End Printing (with precut pull-off tabs)--- except for occasional interum-supply shipments.

@_subject: !!!EARN BIG $$$ POSTING GIO FLIERS!!! 
GIO College Posting Enterprizes Dept  Box 2028 Gilbert AZ 85229 USA
Welcome to the wonderful world of college-posting!!!  Unless you are: (1) independently-wealthy, (2) are an entrenched execcutive with extensive company stock-options, or (3) have a steady, permanent, gravy civil-service position--- you may do well to visualize that you have just stumbled into the equivilant of a gold-mine!  In this relatively lucrative field, you can indeed fulfill all those dreams about essentially working for yourself: on your own schedule, where you please, as much or as little as you want to!  You can persue it as a full time occupation--- or just dabble at it on the side-line while working a regular job. . .if you are fortunate to have such.
All it consist of is walking around college and university campuses and posting fliers and such on convinent bulletin-boards and the like.  About the only items you need is a stapler and staples (and maybe a roll of tape).  You simply stick materials up on the boards for students to see.  For each product that you post fliers for, you are assigned a unique agent code-number--- which goes on that paticular flier's tabs.  When inquiries (and so sales) result they are tracked acording to your code, and added to your account.  In sum: Fliers are shipped to you free: you post them. . . responses come in--- and you accumulate commissions.  Checks are mailed either forthnightly or monthly.  Yes indeed: make quick, easy cash posting these tear-strip fliers--- as simple as that!  And no--- you don't have to send us any money: we send you money instead! A few pointers:
GENERAL: If your campuses are like many others across the country, should you just slap up fliers in any old way any old where at any old time--- well, don't expect any real worthwhile results.  Done in this fashion, when you put up a flier tonight, tomorrow morning it will be plastered over with ads for fraternity parties, upcoming club-
meetings, bands looking for bass-players, and so-on and so-
forth. "The only way to find a clean place to post at the University of Florida is to light a match," jokes Mike Eisenberg, president of Collegiate Promotions International, a postering company in Tampa, Florida.  Such is because most people posting bulletin-boards are unsophisticated and haphazard in how they poster: they just grab any old stapler, copies of their flier, and roam around plastering on whim, paying little real attention to what they are doing.  "You don't have to be absolutely professional (though that sure helps) to be effective, but you need to be efficient," says Stephen Crockett, president of Mid-South Marketing in Tennessee.  Just remember--- if you are: (1) courteous to other regular posting critters that use your boards consistantly, (2) keep track of where you put your posters, and (3) monitor boards regularly--- well, then, you can attract a lot of attention (and so responses) through your flier-
posting eforts. Putting up fliers, posters, and other materials in the right manner around campus can be well worth your time and effort.  It will prove to make a vast difference in your checks--- say: $100, if you do--- vs $10, if you don't!  DON'T HOG THE BOARDS! Never put more than one (or two, if massive space is available) posters/fliers on each bulletin board.  You'll acquire a bad image and create hard feelings among student-groups and others if you blanket the boards with your materials. If you have variations of a given fleir (with significent differences), then one (or possibly two) of each might be admissable--- depending on size-of-board(s) and other conditions.
 REMOVE ANY OUTDATED POSTERS/FLIERS YOU FIND FIRST (IN MOST CASES)
Usually, don't wait weeks or months to jerk down any present items with past-dates on them. "At one school, I found posters that were 18 months old, towards thirty layers thick," Mid-South's Crockett says. "If it looks messy, people will poster over top of you. A lot of students aren't going to check before they post you over." At some places, the situation is different: The University of Texas at Austin has developed an innovative postering technique that has helped prevent a lot of unsightly trash around campus. "Students used to put posters anyplace, on trees, trash cans, basically anything that didn't move," says Jerry Harrison, UT's manager of landscape services. "But a few years ago, we built some kiosks which are barrel-
shaped, made out of redwood. Every six inches, we have these large elastic bands that are permanently attached. Students can slip the posters under it. They work great."  But with most schools nothing so inovative exists--- and keeping your materials prominately displayed remains a constant, on-going battle.
 GENERALLY, WALLS ARE A NO-NO.
Nearly all colleges and universities across the nation (Canada too)  
prohibit clubs from sticking posters to interior or exterior classroom walls. If a surface has dry-wall (sheet-rock, as it is called) behind it--- well, then, taping or stapling posters to such will eventually peal off the paint. . , or possibly tear off the top layer of the dry-wall when removed!  If a wall is concrete or cinder-
block (especially unpainted) then you have more leeway.  If glass, probably pasting there is okay--- in unpainted: if painted, it is likely to take off the paint when removed: nor big deal, possibly, but to be avoided if possible.  If wood, also exercise caution: paint won't come off nearly as easily as with glass--- but the possibility still exists; if the place already hass spots where paint has come-
off with old fliers removed in the past, then such happening with yours won't matter much though.  Some walls, actually, are made from the same stuff as most bulletin-boards: a layer of thin corogated-
like rubber-matting over light (usually pine) sheet-wood--- which permit easily stapling; may such spots you'll find already have things affixed to them.  Above all, watch what glue you use: avoid model air-plane, rubber-cement, Elmers, 3M, Epoxy, etc; instead, employ so-called glue-sticks--- available at most stores like Staples.  Such are actually composed of wax, with some mild chemical adhesive mixed in--- and so hold reasonably well, while possessing little destructive potential.
 CAUTION WITH STAPLE-GUNS
Heavy-duty staple-guns (using standard thick staple-gun staples) are a bozo no-no because they tear up the boards. Instead, use an office stapler, such as an Arrow stapler, or a "light-duty" staple gun: such is a power instrument, but uses regular-style staples (even if appropriately chisel-pointed).  KEEP TRACK OF THE BEST POSTING LOCATIONS Spend an hour or two going around your campus to do a bulletin board inspection: where they are, how heavily covered they are, and how well they're maintained. Keep detailed notes about your observations of each location. If possible, maintain tabs about how many students walk by the boards and note how many actually stop for a minute or two to read posters. (One time-tested option is to place posters on the backs of stall doors in restrooms. These locations are the ultimate captive audience. "Since Simmons College is all women, this works really well," says Karen Boss, a former student activities employee at Simmons. "People will always read what is in front of them." )
 CLASSROOMS VS BREEZEWAYS In classrooms, students are stuck in one place for an hour or more. If you place your posters inside classrooms on the small bulletin boards near the doors (or whereever available), you'll get the whole class's attention. "If you're looking for maximum exposure, breezeways may be best. But classrooms are better for reaching specific majors," Crockett says. "You may get over two-hundred kids through a classroom in a day, but you may have 2,000 students walk down a hallway, which is way more competition, but also a lot more traffic."  BEST TIMES TO POSTER Go late at night or early in the morning. "We try to get out at 4 or 5 a.m. and leave enough of the board exposed so that anyone posting later will likely leave some of our posters," says Charles Grapski of the Independent Student Coalition at the University of Florida. "Sometimes it's a chore, but it can be fun."  Nights may work better at some schools (or at least for paticular buildings.  
Sometimes weekends are about the only time to get into some places during the whole semester.
 WHERE TO POSTER ON A BOARD Try to put your posters at eye level and remember than everyone isn't the same height. Some people are taller than others, while others use wheelchairs.  Posting in a board's middle may well usually get you posted over quickly.  Tops or bottoms may work better in the long-
run.  Vetran (35 years) New England posterer Ricahrd Paris prefers to line his materils up-and-down the side ob boardds--- which makes some sense: as then they can be covered over from onley one direction, instead of three. "One of the most unique means of attracting attention that I've observed on our campus is when groups place a `Burma Shave' type display on stairs," says Ken Peress of Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. "You can't miss them when you start up (or come down) the steps." Some stair-wells have boards for easy stapling.  If not, then fliers taped to the wall of various landing-
levels can work wonders if they stay up reasonably long.  WHAT IF SOMEONE POSTERS OVER YOU? If someone slaps their posters over yours, remove theirs. You have that right. But knowing how much you hate it when this happens to you, don't perpetuate the problem. That's precisely why you shouldn't post over someone else's fliers.  IN SOME CASES, SCHOOL POSTING-STAMPS MAY BE APPLICABLE Some schools are annal-retentative aobut what is psoted in their environs--- or at least some paticualr buildings on a campus may operate like that.  The psychologically-disadvantaged creatures running these places may first require that all posters and flyers be approved by the dean's office or by student-activities office or some-
such nonsense: that is, stamped with an official seal--- and they may well be adverse with stamping many items they have some deranges beef against, such as your paticular fliers. "At our school, students have to get their posters stamped at each building, which has control of how its posters are distributed," says Cynthia Kane, assistant director of Student Activities at Seton Hall University in New York. And she's just referring to school-related things.  So at some places, where your stuff isn't stampable, and won't stay up worth squat unstamped--- they may well not be worth posting. . . at least in the traditional mode.  In such cases, taping them to soft-drink machine sides, in in side pay-phone stations (not owned by the school) may be applicable.
CONCLUSION: You can get better attention and thus response if you develop a strategy about when, where, and how to display posters and fliers on campus to get the most exposure possible.  Simple as that! Print-off, fill-out, and mail this form today! Even if you already post some GIO items, you need to fill in and snail-mail this form to acquire the others for your bags. Fliers come, professionally-
produced, from West-End Printing (with precut pull-off tabs)--- except for occasional interum-supply shipments.
OUR CURRENT LINE-UP:
(1) FUTUREQUEST. A proven, 13-year track-record winner! Top-notch opportunity offer--- a complete money-making kit designed for students. Pays $7 a sale! (2) ESQUIRE. Somewhat newer, this opportunity has a slightly different slant--- to appeal to those with other perceptions. Developed by other originaters, this complements without duplicating FQ. Several years old now. Pays $6 a sale. (3) BETTER SOLUTIONS. Another angle on the same take, true--- but this was engineered quite differently. Aims at another sort of audience-- though still accomodates a fair percentage of those favored by FQ & ESQUIRE. Flier is totally different--- seems like something from an alien univese to FQ & ESQUIRE. Also several years old now. Pays $7 a sale. (4) CREDIT-REPAIR KIT. Actually, part of the BS-offer--- the main component designed for students to post off-campus. Your flier looks different, is student-oriented, for on-campus posting. Some students may post their version some on-campus though. Pays $6 a sale. (5) PINK PLEASURES. A guide to legal Nevada bordelloes! Will have guys fighting for the library or dorm computer to order their copy first. Obviously not good for religious schools--- but the discrete posting flier can be reasonably hung just about relatively anywhere else. Pays $7 a sale. (6) INTERNET-USER CASH-GENERATOR. About a year old now, this one is really starting to pick up. Mostly details hundreds of internet-
programs, with free sign-up, that students can use to generate payments and such to their accounts. Posting fliers proclaim Internet Users/Surfers Wanted. Pays $6 a sale. (7) INTERNET INCOME OFFER. Mainly concerns free sign-up internet programs for making money off the net. Some are a real doozy. A sure hot-seller. Pays $6 a sale. (8) CAPITOL ONE CREDIT-CARD. One of the greatest additions to the posting-industry ever. These CapOne fliers can be posted at all universities, colleges, vocational-technical schools or anyplace you want to post them. Students simply enter a url referral-link, with your unique agent-code embedded within, into any handy computer. They complete the application online--- and within a minute are denied or approved. With every approval, you accumulate $9. Students have literally been snatching these fliers from reps' hands before said reps can staple them onto bulletin-boards! This is no hype: it is ABSOLUTELY true! We kid thee not! Pays $9 per approval! (9) DIRT-CHEAP! Scholarship-search. Yes, it's back! Since all but the last step is done via the net, the cost for students is rock-bottom---
 for searches from multiple data-bases. Even pays the same $5.50 a sale like the old Student Services deal--- maybe more later-on. (10) AUTO-INSURANCE. Again, students take a tab, type a url, embedded with your code, into the address-slot, click Enter. Such takes them to the site, where they complete a form for a quote. Your account is automatically credited. Pays $1 or more per quote. (11) AMERICAN-EXPRESS CREDIT-CARD OFFER. Essentially, this works the same as the CapOne item. Are you sick of being allowed to post Amex apps from APM only at certain universities in the small, paticular area(s) Kerry or Lance sees fit to condescendingly code you for--- because those are the only places your apps will be paid on when they are mailed-in? Well, fret no more. These Amex fliers can be posted at ANY upper school--- and you are eligable for payment for any of those approvals from anywhere. Usually pays comparable to CapOne. (12) TRAFFIC TICKETS. A guide to fighting traffic-tickets in court. Good for off-campus posting as well as on-campus posting. Pays $5 or more a sale. (13) TEXTBOOKS. Huge selection of new and used. Dirt-cheap prices. Pays a percentage of all sales. Pure potential dynamite! (Not available in Canada.)
(14) THINGS-FROM-ANOTHER-WORLD. Primarily comic-books. Humonegous range of publshers and titles. Also: CDs, maybe sometimes videos. Pays on a percentage of sale basis. (15) NEXTCARD. Yet another postable-anywhere credit-card. And we mean anywhere--- on (any) campus or off! Essentially the same deal as with CapOne and Amex. Pays similarly.
