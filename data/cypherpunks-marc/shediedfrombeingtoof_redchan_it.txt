To modanon's credit, the 'International System of Units', abbreviated
(SI) because it is clearly French, 'SystÃ¨me International', lol,
assigned 'K' to the thermodynamic temperature measurement of 'Kelvin'
(later renamed kelvin).
However, I am arguing that the poor organizational form and use of
'kilo' vs 'Kilo' and 'k' vs 'K', is shit.
Do not use shit logic just because some (((authority))) says so and call
yourself a cypherpunk.

Yeah, and juan.g71[at]gmail[dot]com and grarpamp[at]gmail[dot]com are
the same person because they both use jewgle mail and work for the feds.
It must be true because it's on the internet.

Proper ? Please explain.
Please explain why.
You are (((correct))).
170kB is most (((proper))).
The first letter of a word is not a prefix, modanon.
Kilo is the prefix.
Learn to think for yourself instead of letting others think for you.
Kilo is a word.
Byte is a word.
Kilobyte is an endocentric or copulative compound word.
Compound words are abbreviated as initialisms.
KB is thus the most suitable abbreviation.
Here's some news:
To address this confusion, a new set of binary prefixes have been
introduced which are based on powers of 2. In that system, 1024 bytes
are called a kibibyte or 1 KiB.""
A new set of binary prefixes...sounds familiar.

So ideas are not the property of someone,
unless it is a new idea,
then it belongs to all those who thought before it,
because it's 99.99999999% theirs.
Do you even read before you post ?
So we are in agreement.
The legal terms are what we disagree on.  The right to ownership is not.
 I concede to your argument against my defense of laws to defend things,
seeable or not.
If you think that the right to ownership can only be granted by others,
which is what you argue when you say that the right to copy can only be
granted as a privilege by some external authority.

I never argued for "national" borders.

these "imaginary" lines, physical or not, differ from those drawn in

You offered nothing but "not valid".
Just like your "bullshit" argument; why ?
I do not cheat, sir.
How dare you. =)

Î ÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¯Î± translates to "the painted [marked] ones".
I am sure you have been marked, my british friend.
I am a girl, you nigger.
Typical cuck, bear half of the responsibilities but have none of the
control.  As Juan asserts, the woman's body ends where the child's begins.
Until it is assured by force.
That force can be an agreement, or IRL aktion.
You draw a border around your property line, should "le ebil natsees"
start shitting on it, only an agreement or IRL aktion will stop them.

Correct. It has an actual meaning.
Brit + ish
Brit, or Brith, Berith, Bris
[Sephardic Hebrew breet;
Ashkenazic Hebrew bris;
English bris, brit]
noun, Hebrew.
1. the Jewish rite of circumcising a male child eight days after his birth.

What proofs are there to expel false claims to owner/inventorship ?
Tell that to pro-choicers :^)
These "imaginary" lines often exist in the form of rivers and oceans.
"Persons" make up groups like "governments" and often agree about the
"imaginary" lines that form their "community" or "home".  Why are these
lines, physical or not, different from those drawn in sovereignty of
one's body ?
Because you are American, not "Brown", or "Muslim".
This isn't even a thing.  "Black" and "White" are tricks to rob people
of their ancestral heritage.  Paco and Pajeet are nothing alike, yet
they both identify as "Brown".
Only the chosen people and nachos con crema Ã¡cida are supreme.

Not everyone has access to the teachings of Muhammad.
You misspelled jewish.
What are the alternatives ?
As it should be, though very few actually practice nationalism.
Your argument against boundaries is weak.
Does your body not have boundaries ?
What about your house ?
Or your Mosque ?
This is true.  Welfare queens, miners, police, bankers; they are all the
The word 'Slave' comes from 'Slav', Caucasians who were purchased and
sold as property by your people, haramanon.
From who ?  The niggers that stole the land from the people who came
before them ?
You should learn some fucking American history.  Mayans migrated from
the Utah area and killed those living in the YucatÃ¡n to build their
"empire".  The Lakota migrated from Asia and killed every tribe they
encountered on their way East.  And the earliest records of humans on
the American continent **so far** are Norths People and Polynesians, the
original people, afaict.
