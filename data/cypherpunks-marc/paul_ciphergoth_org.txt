Silverman is AFAICT the most knowledgeable person to have commented on
all this.  He has no axe to grind, unless you count the inexcusably
unfair treatment he received from RSA. All of his sci.crypt comments are available with this search:
His off-the-cuff estimate of a good new recommended key size was 2048 bits.
It would be good to hear more from other integer factorisation experts.

If the NSA's attack involves generating some sort of collision between a
curve and something else over a 160-bit space, they wouldn't have to be
worried that someone else would find and attack that "weak curve class"
with less than 2^160 work.
