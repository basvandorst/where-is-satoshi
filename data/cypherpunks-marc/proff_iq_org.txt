Post-war US liberties were usually restored after apalling abuses by the
mendacious followed by intensive lobbing by civil rights activists.
It'd be nice to cut the former phase short. Although, perhaps the
better tactic is to let them run-amok. It certainly worked for
the Netherlands.

Any man who keeps a cat is either sensitive. Or gay. Or both. Tim
keeps two.
 I have two cats. Raised from kittenhood. They are delightful...no
 scratching, no tearing up of furniture, a joy to be around. Both are
 males, both were fixed (neutered) at the usual age.
 Have you considered having him be mainly an outdoor cat? Just a
 little bit of food and medical care, and maybe a warm place to
 sleep, should be enough. Many people with "outdoor cats" let them
 in at night and put them out in the morning. This minimizes the
 "tearing up while owners are out" effect.

FAS falls.
fas.org's Project on Government Secrecy, has not only pulled 200
documents from it's web-site (including crude NSA HQ maps),
but has apparently lobbied Google to remove fas, in its entireity,
from the Google cache. FAS and Aftergood have now fallen to the

Declan, Declan.
Put away your straw man. There are alternative's other than huts
and two dollars an hour (which is high, btw).  Nobel ecconomic
laureates have been telling us for years to be careful about
idealised market models and to start looking at players not as mere
as capital and labour but as information processing nodes.
This years Nobel for Economics won by George A. Akerlof, A.  Michael
Spence and Joseph E. Stiglitz "for their analysis of markets with
assymetric information" is typical.
You don't need a Nobel to realise that the relationship between a
large employer and employee is brutally assymetric. One entity
knows far more about the rules of the negotiation than the other.
There's you as a prospective employee and then there's the local
workplace monopoly with hundreds of industrial relations lawyers,
psychologists, and other assorted strategists who'll hand you a
document thick with legalese and tell you where to sign. Without
a legal team, you'll never understand it or the political connections
backing it up.  And even if you do there's a million other mugs to
choose from who won't.
To counter this sort of assymetry. Employees naturally start trying
to collectivise to increase their information processing and
bargaining power. That's right. UNIONS Declan. Those devious entities
that first world companies and governments have had a hand in
suppressing all over the third world by curtailing freedom of
association, speech and other basic political rights we take for

@_subject: Re: My current readings in Category Theory 
Category theory is nice, but would be nicer if could draw in
information theoretic and cognitive metaphors. Maths is a programming
language selected over time for execution on (perhaps slightly
modified) human brains. The failure to recognize this deeply held
anthropomorphism is excusable in other areas of mathematics, but
not in foundational studies.  Human beings look at the world through
their own mental "axioms" which have evolved to understand the
physical world and each other.  These axioms must be chased down
and stated instead of allowing them to subtly invade the mathematical
process.  For category theory, this failing likely evolved from
its birth as a theory of mathematical classification as opposed to
a theory of _origin_, although to be fair no foundational theory seems to be free of it.
About 15 years ago category theory leaked into programming language
design. See  and  (yes,
thats me) for the two major real-world-useful category theory
inspired languages.
OO programming is classification from above. Classification
comes first and is then acts as (an often inconsistent and poorly
realized) behavioral constraint. For category theory inspired
languages, classification (types) are inferred from _behavior_. For
these languages, behavioral inconsistency is discovered by the
inability to come to consistent classification which describes it.
