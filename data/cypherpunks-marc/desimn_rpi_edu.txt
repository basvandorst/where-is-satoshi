@_subject: Re: [ros-kernel] Windows source leaked? 
Microsoft's Source Code is something called a trade secret, that source code was not supposed to be released in the first place, it was leaked illegally.  Obviously you don't know a whole lot about the way the copyright system works, you can do 4 things with a piece of copyrighted material, sell it, license it, release it to the public domain, or hang on to it and not let anyone else have it.  Microsoft License's their IP, and we do not have a valid license to that source code that allows us to use it for derivative works (nor will Microsoft ever give us one), so therefore even peaking at it will make us legally liable.  If you don't like the way copyright works, then don't complain to us about it, all we do is strictly follow it to the letter.  If you would like to contest the current setup of the copyright system, write a letter to your senator or start a petition, but this mailing list is not about lawmaking, so therefore this discussion has ended, I will not discuss this issue further, and I encourage everyone else to do the same.
