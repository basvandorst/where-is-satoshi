Seth Lloyd, "Ultimate physical limits to computation":
"""As an example, quantitative bounds are put to the computational
power of an âultimate laptopâ with a mass of one kilogram conï¬ned to a
volume of one liter.
The ultimate laptop performs 2mc^2 /ÏÂ¯h = 5.4258 Ã 10^50 logical
operations per second on â 10^31 bits. Although its computational
machinery is in fact in a highly speciï¬ed physical state with zero
entropy, while it performs a computation that uses all its resources
of energy and memory space it appears to an outside observer to be in
a thermal state at â 10^9 degrees Kelvin. The ultimate laptop looks
like a small piece of the Big Bang."""
