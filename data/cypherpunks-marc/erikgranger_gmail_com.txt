I'll believe it when he signs arbitrary messages with satoshis key. No
signature, no story.

That seems like a losing battle, if he decides to transflood the chain,
can't the fork simply ignore that chain? Also, the more he does this,  the
more money he loses to trx fees, so wouldn't he just be throwing money in
the garbage, and exacerbating the blockspace shortage, by doing so? It
seems that if he did that, it would congest blocks massively, and as a
result encourage adoption of any disagreeable fork that provides larger
block sizes.
