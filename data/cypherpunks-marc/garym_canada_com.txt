Canada.com privacy policy:            "The canada.com Network collects personally identifying
           information about you only when you specifically and
           knowingly provide it to us."
           ... and implicitly, using this service satisfies this
           condition?  Canada.com TOS:     D> You have not shown otherwise. If you don't like it, get a

This is not the point, now, is it.  I have, I believe, provided you
with the bits; you now have the TOS and Privacy Policy, and I have
read them both but can find no statement that says "we reserve the
right to read your emails without your knowledge and to take action
based on the contents of your emails.  we reserve the right to censor
your emails should someone try to send you materials _we_ decide are
You find those two statements, or statements to that effect, and I
will be quite happy to admit I have no case.  As I stated before, my
_real_ mail host did try these filters, and when I asked for them to
be removed, they did so cheerfully and within an hour.  Canada.com has
not responded to my emails, and there is no profile option to opt
out of this censorship service, nor any mention that this censorship
even occurs.
We come down to a question that arose early in the 90's: Is disrupting
internet a crime?  In 1988 it was not, but by 1996 it was a serious
crime because people came to rely on Internet for life-critical
services.  My point is that _email_ can be at least as and perhaps
more life-critical than snail-mail, and should be granted the same
basic protections.
If Mr Jones _requests_ that I scrap any letters from his sister, then
that is _his_ decision, not mine.

Which they do not.  If they do, I cannot find it.
If they had a policy statement saying "we monitor your email and
filter what we believe is spam" which then defines "spam" and further
promises, as their privacy statement does, never to disclose the
contents of my email to any human eyes without a supoena, then I'd be
happy.  I'd know where I stand and if I discovered they'd banned BCE
(their competitor) from sending me contract offers, I'd have recourse
to recompense.
I'd be happier still if they disclosed the regex's they used, but
that's wishing for too much.
    D> ... is that the filtering is overbroad. In a few years of
    D> experience with canada.com, I have found it to snare only spam.
Precisely my point: How about the one's you have not found?  How do
you know the filtering is overbroad?  My spam cans collect upwards of
a hundred spams a day through this account, so the filtering doesn't
work as advertised, so what is it they are snaring?  The simple fact
is, we _don't_ know, _and_ they make _no_ promises.
So, to summarize then, you have _no_ objections to my secretly rifling
through my neighbour's post _providing_ I then hand-deliver his post
for free?  Remind me never to share an apartment block with you.

Thanks for the confirmation, but please, use the correct terminology.
"Filter" implies a passive sifting, like a coffee filter or an air
filter.  It has sweet tones of purity. What Canada.com (and I presume from your accepting "defense" that
others do this too) is doing is _censorship_, which is, according to
my Oxford dictionary, the action of "an official authorized to examine
printed matter, movies, news &c, before public release, and to
suppress any parts on the grounds of obscenity a threat to security
&c."  How can you describe it as otherwise?  How is this different
than tapping my telephone or reading my snail-mail?
    D> In canada.com's defense, it does notify the sender that the
    D> message was blocked as spam, and it has only blocked spam so
    D> far, and no legit messages to that subscriber.
Let's be accurate again: "At least those emails where Canada.com
notifies me would be classed as spam" ... they _don't_ however, notify
_me_ that they've done this, and we don't know -- they _may_ be doing
other funky things with the contents of my email.
Who needs carnivore when you can get it for free from Canada's largest
and wealthiest communications company?  Excuse me, I'm just going to pop out to the mailboxes and go through
my neighbour's mail; he might have some spam in there, y'know.  Oops,
nope, no spam today, but, hey ...  _this_ is sure interesting ...
