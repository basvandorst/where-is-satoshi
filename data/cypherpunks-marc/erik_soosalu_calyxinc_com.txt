I'd assume the NSA and CSIS would be talking as needed.
Whether CSIS is actually monitoring in there is another question.  I'd
assume yes, but have never heard anything to confirm or deny.

If your talking "the NSA" I doubt anyone would tell you.  That being
said: it would mean the US gov't breaking Canadian law I suspect.  Now
in Canada it is quite possible that the Canadian Fed gov't monitors
traffic but I would also say no one would tell you because telling you
would also be in violation in wiretap laws.
Best advice, assume they do and hope they don't. :)
151 front street at Toronto?  NSA allegedly monitors data centres in the
US, but does it have the same influence at a building sitting in its
neighbor's soil?
together.  but not sure how helpful the information on there really is?
