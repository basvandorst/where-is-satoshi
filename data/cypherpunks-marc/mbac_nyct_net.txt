@_subject: [vorbis-dev] Changes.. 
This is the first project I'm taking an active interest in, so I trust
that the guiding hand of flamethrowing will teach me the ways.
I was anxious to start playing with Vorbis somehow, so I downloaded it via
CVS and tried to get the tool in vorbis/cmdline to compile. It didn't
compile at all until I made the attached changes.
Note that I'm only trying to guess as to how the 'fill_buffer' function
was supposed to work, since I wasn't able to find it anywhere else in the
Now that it does compile (without segfaulting), it just kinda hangs while
trying to play an .ogg file I generated earlier. Would it actually try to
play to an audio device?
Apologies if the maintainer (the guy with CVS write access) knew about
this and resents my meddlings. :)
