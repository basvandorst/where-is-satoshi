account and of the Washington Mutual network is
our primary concern.
Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily limited
access to sensitive account features.   To restore your account access, please take
the following steps to ensure that your account has not been
compromised:   1. Login

will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal ID and
Password and fill in all the required information, including
your name and your account number.   2. Review your recent account history for any
unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your account
profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized activity has
taken place on your account, report this to Washington
staff immediately.   To get started, please click the link below:
