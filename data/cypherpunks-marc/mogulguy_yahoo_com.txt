Well, unfortunately that just isn't the case.  Many
people have different (political) opinions on just
what exactly human rights means.  It is not so simple
as you would think (I wish it were).  For example, this
declaration (which is used by the UN) is full of political (and even contradictory) ideas, and "rights".
Again, I am not trying to start a debate about what
human rights should be (this is the wrong place for that), but just to point out that unfortunately it
is pretty hard to make the "non-political" claim
you probably wish were true.
To be more illustrative of my "political point", the following "rights" would be considered
by most to be socialist ideas:
* Article 22
* Article 23 - 1
* Article 25 - 1,2
* Article 26 - 1
* Article 29 - 1
The following are pro democracy:
* Article 21 - 3
Articles which are pro-property rights (and sound very contradictory to the socialist articles above):
* Article 17 - 2
Pro intellectual property "rights":
* Article 27 - 2
And this is just to me the obvious political ones, but
someone biased differently than me could probably point
out very different "political" articles than the ones
I did.
Agreed, and I wish we could all agree, but I certainly don't agree with several of the articles
mentioned above (and I am often disgusted when asked
to support some of them when starting a new job). :(

Which give me another idea.  What if directory servers were used to publish a "secret port knocking handshake"
for relays?  This would allow relays to go unnoticed on
port scans.  Obviously this would not be a technique to
hide tor relays, but only to hide open ports from ISPs.
As long as they do not specifically target tor relay operators, this might be effective?

A right is something someone should not be able to prevent you from doing, not something that should be provided to you.  I believe that "you have the right to be a space tourist if you want to be", but, of
course, that does not imply that I believe that you should be able to become a space tourist for $10 (unless someone offers it to you at this price voluntarily).  The right to do something and the means to do it are two completely separate issues.
Despite that fact that the term is commonly
miss-used, if someone has to actively do something to give you something, it can never be properly labeled a "right".  If you are stranded on an island somewhere alone (by no fault of others), it is illogical to suggest that someone or some organization can violate your rights without
interacting with you are your island's environment.
If you define something as a right which requires
action on someone else's part, it obviously cannot
be fulfilled without violating this principal.  By
violating this principle, a lone human survivor
on earth after a holocaust would have his rights
violated by the non-existence of others or a government to act.  Clearly this is non-sense and illogical.  If you think that something is
a basic human right, perhaps you should reconsider
if it does not play well with this logic.  And, yes
I do realize that this throws out many of the commonly accepted "rights" that many people believe
should be "rights".  This simply illustrates many
of the common politically illogical (but potentially well meaning) beliefs.
You are perhaps correct to assume that some here on
this list and some of the developers share the larger
desire that you express, but I do not believe that
you could make the claim that this is what tor is about or attempting to achieve.  If the tor project
became so misguided that it attempted to achieve your
expressed goal politically, (which is the only logical
end point to your belief since you declared it a "human-right"), I would quickly drop support for it and stop running my relay since this would inevitably
mean forcing ISPs to provide people with a service they are unwilling to pay for -> theft.
But surely, as you do, I hope that people can get cheap internet access, this hardly means it deserves
the status of "right", or a long pricing discussion
here on or-talk.  I am not suggesting that the topic
is off-limits either, just that is seems inappropriate for long rants here...  Of course,
I am not related to the project, this is just my
Cheers, and hopefully via technology, cheap anonymous internet to all, :)

Seems like another good argument in favor of implementing a mechanism for relays to work behind firewalls, you would not need to have any open ports.
This might be another way that they attack bittorent users since to get better bandwidth, they need to open ports.
While it does suck, ultimately you can't blame them for
this policy (the other BS notwithstanding) since it is in their AUP.  There's a reason I don't use such an account despite having to regularly justify the extra monthly expense to my wife when she asks: "why can't we use one of those cheap DSL/cable internet services I see advertised everywhere?"  If they couldn't do this, to stay competitive, they would charge more money for everyone and you would suffer more. Cheap internet access and "serving" is not some inherent human right, so let's not complain about the price of gas here. ;)  (unless it is to propose ways to make tor use less gas...)

You have three choices when it comes to trusting something: 1) you can check yourself, 2) you can have someone you trust check, 3) you can trust an authority.
Having the source code enables option 1 and 2.  Option 3 is pretty much useless if your concern is authority in the first place, no?
So like it or not, having the source code is more
useful than anything else anyone can propose.  It
is not perfect, but it is the ONLY recourse that
has even a remote chance of being useful against
trusting authority.
