@_subject: "Stagefright" text attack to Android. 
"A MOBILE SECURITY RESEARCHER has done his work and found a cluster of vulnerabilities in Android that, when combined, present a problem for 95 percent of the user base.
This is bad stuff. Despite references to unicorns in the official information, there is also some goosebump-inducing wordplay. The official warning is that almost anyone with an Android mobile phone can be sent one text message and be plunged into security chaos.
This threat package has been dubbed Stagefright by Joshua Drake from the security outfit Zimperium zLabs.
"Gaining remote code execution privileges merely by having access to the mobile number? Enter Stagefright. The targets for this kind of attack can be anyone from prime ministers, government officials, company executives, security officers to IT managers," said the firm in a blog post.
"[We] dived into the deepest corners of Android code and discovered what we believe to be the worst Android vulnerabilities discovered to date. These issues in Stagefright code critically expose 95 percent of Android devices, an estimated 950 million devices."
If this does not have you standing on a chair pushing your phone away with a broomstick, then get ready for this. Zimperium said that Stagefright is worse than Heartbleed - and we all know how that worked out."

Italy cracks Mafia sheep code to arrest Godfather's henchmen
By Ella Ide 1 hour ago
Rome (AFP) - Italian police on Monday arrested 11 suspects linked to the fugitive head of the Sicilian Mafia, including a former boss who ran a secret message system for the mobster using a sheep-based code.
Matteo Messina Denaro, 53, who has been on the run since 1993, used a farm in Mazara del Vallo to communicate with his henchmen via the aged-old method of "pizzini", bits of paper containing messages often written in cipher, police said.
Among those arrested was former boss Vito Gondola, 77, whose job it was to call the clan members to alert them to each new message, which was placed under a rock in a field at the farm and often destroyed on the spot after reading.
"I've put the ricotta cheese aside for you, will you come by later?" he would say on the telephone -- a phrase investigators said had nothing to do with dairy products.
"The sheep need shearing... the shears need sharpening" and "the hay is ready", were among other code phrases used to alert the gang to a new message, written on tightly folded bits of paper wrapped in Sellotape and then hidden in the dirt.
The police investigation, which followed the passing of messages between 2011 and 2014, used hidden cameras and microphones around the farm near Trapani in western Sicily to follow the movements of the clan -- and discover Denaro's fading glory.

Gondola is caught in one conversation telling another mobster that Denaro -- once a trigger man who reportedly boasted he could "fill a cemetery" with his victims -- was losing control over the latest generation of criminals, who "disappear without saying anything".
- 'State win, Mafia loses' -
Three of those arrested were over 70 years old.
The only known photos of Denaro date back to the early 1990s. He is believed to be the successor of the godfathers Toto Riina and Bernardo Provenzano, who are both serving life sentences, but less is known about him.
At the height of his power he had a reputation as a flashy, ruthless womaniser who ruled over at least 900 men with an iron fist.

The 11 suspects arrested "were the men who were closest to Denaro right now," said police official Renato Cortese, adding that it was "too early to say" whether the sting would help investigators close in on the fugitive.
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi thanked the investigators in a message on his Facebook page, saying onwards all, to finally capture the super-fugitive boss," insisting "Italy is united against organised crime" despite a recent slew of corruption scandals in the country.
"The state wins, the Mafia loses," Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said on Twitter.
Gondola, who despite his age rose every morning at 4 am to tend to his flock, is believed to have once been a right-hand man to Riina. In the 1970s he belonged to a gang used by the Mafia to carry out kidnappings, according to Italian media reports.
The Sicilian Mafia, known as "Cosa Nostra" or "Our Thing", was the country's most powerful organised crime syndicate in the 1980s and 1990s, but has seen its power diminish following years of investigations and mass arrests.
It also faces fierce underworld competition from the increasingly powerful Naples-based Camorra and Calabria's 'Ndrangheta.

There were actually TWO appeal filings by me; I perhaps got them out of order in my last note here, a moment ago.  This might have been the second one of them filing around the time of the "sentencing".  Because the District Court had ignored its loss of jurisdiction, I felt it appropriate to yet again appeal the "sentencing".

Notice the reference to "Jurisdictional Defects", below.  They were trying to pretend that the filing of an Interlocutory appeal did not divest jurisdiction from the District Court case below.  For those looking up, see the "Dunbar Rule".  My filing was proper, and was jurisdictional, so Judge Tanner shouldn't have been able to proceed with what in reality was a phony trial.

This is the SECOND appeal from case 00-5731, done weeks after my first, Interlocutory Appeal.  This is the appeal that those conspiring against me WANTED to be "the appeal".   But its very existence was improper, because it ignores the prior, CORRECT appeal, which I initiated in March 2001.

What you have shown is the docket for appeal case 99-30210.
Note:  There are two clues which show that this docket was forged and thus fraudulent.  The docket item number, which is immediately to the right of the date, should be sequential numbers starting from 1 and going up.  SOMETIMES these numbers aren't precisely sequential (they may appear as 1,2,3,5,4... etc) but they should ALWAYS be present.
When I received this docket about June 20, 2003, 29 of the 79 docket entries were MISSING.  That should NEVER happen!  What actually, apparently happened is that the 9th Circuit personnel FORGED (falsified) the docket about May 2000, after they discovered that I was demanding to have an appeal of the lower-court case.  Before that time (say, March 2000) those court personnel believed (correctly, as it happened) that I was not aware of the existence of this court case, 99-30210.  They expected this appeal case to 'die'.  My demand for an appeal, though I was not aware of the existence of 99-30210, really messed things up for them!  They couldn't refuse to give me an appeal, because I was already shown as having an appeal in progress!  They appointed another corrupt attorney, Jonathan Solovy, to generate an appeal, but it was necessary to FIRST 'manipulate' the docket for 99-30210, to make it appear that this appeal had merely remained dormant in the period July 1999-April 2000. This I believe they did in May 2000.  The backups for appeal case 99-30210 (made during the period June 1999 through August 2000) should show this forgery. Solovy's job (which he did) was to conceal the pre-April 2000 existence of appeal case 99-30210 from me.

I filed a Notice of Appeal (Interlocutory) in about March 23,2001, on the new case which began November 2000.  This ISN'T the same case as turned into appeal case 99-30210.  The filing of this appeal notice had the legal effect (albeit ignored) of divesting Tanner's court of jurisdiction to proceed with the upcoming trial.  Tanner, and corrupt attorney Robert Leen, ignored this, however.

Hillary Clinton Showed How the Government Still Doesn't Understand the Encryption Debate
Every time there is a major terror attack that shocks the international consciousness, there are renewed calls for surveillance and increased policing. And even though we're slowly learning that encryption techniques had nothing to do with the attacks on Paris, politicians are still revitalizing a debate as old as the Internet â whether or not the government should be able to break encryption.
Encryption is the process of taking a message, or any block of text or information, and scrambling it so that it can only be read by the intended recipient. It's baked into many message and email systems automatically, preventing law enforcement from catching the messages in transit and unpacking their contents.
On Thursday, Hillary Clinton called on tech companies to avoid seeing the government as an "adversary" and to "develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy" before another attack like Paris occurs.
"Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem," Clinton said during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations last week. "We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack."
Silicon Valley has been vowing in droves to not bend to the political pressure to change their encryption standards. But it's not because they're stubborn, naive or capitalistic. It's because "weakening" encryption is nearly impossible.

Following Paris attacks, encryption services face new scrutiny Alyssa Bereznak, Yahoo Tech By Alyssa Bereznak, Yahoo Tech .A crowd near the Eiffel tower a week after the start of the Paris attacks. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani) A crowd near the Eiffel tower a week after the start of the Paris attacks. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani) Four days after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks that shook Paris, Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram, posted a photo on Instagram of himself on a balcony in France. In the image, he is dressed in black and looking off to the side, the Eiffel Tower in the background framing his stoic expression. If you saw it at a glance, youâd think it was a tribute to the mourning nation. But then thereâs this caption: âI think the French government is as responsible as ISIS for this, because it is their policies and carelessness which eventually led to the tragedy,â it reads. âThey take money away from hardworking people of France with outrageously high taxes and spend them on waging useless wars in the Middle East and on creating [a] parasitic social paradise for North African immigrants. It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of shortsighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place.â Though otherwise confusing, the statement made one thing clear: Durov would rather blame the tragedy that had befallen Paris on French taxes than call attention to the way members of the Islamic state have taken to using his encrypted messaging app to communicate.

Encryption has been all over the headlines after recent terrorist attacks, and the discussion can quickly get cryptic. Is âcryptoâ a fatal weakness of the Internet? An endangered species that must be saved? You can hear heartfelt testimony for either view from both Democratic and Republican politicians.
But ultimately, encryption is just math that, like any other tool, can be used for good or ill. Letâs start with some basics about it that often get neglected in all the commentary.
Q. It was my understanding there would be no math in this storyâ¦?
A. Sorry, itâs unavoidable: Encryption works by encoding information in such a way that its recipient can decode it (without further help from its sender), but no one else can. To do that scrambling, you need to run the original data through one equation or another.
For example, to encrypt something against the prying eyes of somebody whoâs really, really drunk, you could just replace each letter with one 13 places forward (so âAâ becomes âNâ and so on). If your eavesdropper is more capable, youâll need something more complicated â but itâs still all equations.
Q. Okay. What makes for strong cryptography?
A. Using more complex math in an encryption algorithm only goes so far if the sender and recipient use the same key â that is, if they both plug the same secret set of digits into the encryption formula â to encrypt and decrypt. In that case, if either party loses the key, game over.

Exactly correct.
Suppose you take an old-style film camera, one without any sort of automatic
exposure adjustments, to the bright, sunlit beach, and adjusted it to take
good pictures with correct exposures.  Then you wait 12 hours, and it is nighttime.  You do not adjust your camera's settings. If you take a picture
of the sky (except possibly for the Moon) you will see...nothing.  But if you open up the aperture (a variable-diameter shutter designed to allow more, or less, area for light to come in and expose the film), and perhaps if you increased the shutter-speed from, say, 1/1000 second to maybe 10 seconds (and
putting the camera on a tripod to ensure it doesn't move), THEN you will be able
to photograph stars.
That should be easy.  And it would be far easier if built onto that object are
 some microwave-sized  "corner cubes reflectors"  , which have the peculiar property of sending radar (or light, etc) directly back in the direction
 from which it came.  Optical corner-cubes are easy to find:  They are on the backs of cars, and are
used as visual retroreflectors on roads.  They are much better than Scotchlite   , which is made from
tiny glass spheres.

Again, not surprising.  Take a picture of a (non-sun) star, with a small-lens camera (under 50 inch objective) and that star should appear as a point source of light, if the camera is well-focussed.  Even then, the amount of light hitting that analog "pixel" is probably vastly lower than a camera aiming at a nearby surface illuminated by earth's Sun, as would be seen on the Moon by an astronaut taking a picture.

Hash: SHA1
One ostensible 'disproof' of the moon landing was the claim that the video camera didn't show any stars in the moon's sky.  However, the scenery seen in those shots (lunar soil; equipment; astronauts) was extremely bright, somewhat like a beach in full sunlight.  The contrast ratios of (non-silicon) video pickup tubes in that era were not wide, meaning that any star in the sky (other than the sun) couldn't be visible AND show the backgrounds too.

Lack of pressure suit:  No problem.  Early ideas for experimental space included
one that was basically Ace bandages wound around the body.  The skin was exposed
 to the vacuum; the purpose of the bandage was to keep the water from 'boiling'
with the vapor expanding under the skin.  The vapor pressure of water at body temperature, 37 degrees
 C,  is about 50 torr.  One atmosphere pressure at sea level is about 760 torr.  Atmospheric pressure at 50,000 feet is 83 torr.  (1 torr is a mercury column 1
 millimeter high.)
One important need will be thermal insulation, including gloves and a mask.  Lack of oxygen could easily be a problem.  But neglecting air friction, a person would fall about 16,000 feet in 31 seconds.  (1/2 a t-squared) I've read it said that it is just
barely within the realm of possibility for a person to ascend Everest (28,000 feet)
without oxygen.  Presumably, merely falling for 45 seconds  would be far easier. WITH pure oxygen should make things much more doable.
As for hitting the water without a parachute:  If a person's orientation could be guaranteed, the danger
would be little worse than an ordinary high-diver.  Give him a drogue parachute, could be quite small,
and he will enter the water at a known position.

Sure, the fools put a nuclear reactor in a location susceptible to both earthquakes and tsunamis...and then they forgot to provide for cooling the core to prevent meltdown in case they had to 'scram' the reaction.
(A nuclear reactor ordinarily has a rather large population of 'radioactive daughter elements' that continue to decay and emit heat for hours and days after the neutron-absorbing control rods are put back into place.  This continued heat production has the ability, for a few hours, to melt down the core unless cooling water continues to flow.  In an emergency like Fukushima, they needed to provide for such continued water flow for hours, lest the core melt down.  They didn't.  It did.)

@_subject: Stingray legal case 
[quote begins]
On Wednesday, the Maryland Court of Special Appealspublished a legal opinion finding that state police must not only obtain a warrant before deploying a cell-site simulator, but are required to also fully explain to the court what exactly the device does and how it is used.
As Ars has long reported, cell-site simulatorsâknown colloquially as stingrays, can be used to determine a mobile phoneâs location by spoofing a cell tower. In some cases, stingrays can intercept calls and text messages. Once deployed, the devices intercept data from a target phonealong with information from other phones within the vicinity. At times, police have falsely claimed the use of a confidential informant when they have actually deployed these particularly sweeping and intrusive surveillance tools.
In recent years, stingray use has come under increasing scrutiny, with several states includingCalifornia, Washington, Virginia, Minnesota, and Utah now mandating a warrant be issued for their use. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice also imposed new policies that require a warrant for stingray use in most cases.
In an e-mail to Ars, American Civil Liberties Union attorney Nathan Wessler called Wednesday's opinion the "first appellate opinion in the country to fully address the question of whether police must disclose their intent to use a cell site simulator to a judge and obtain a probable cause warrant."
"The courtâs opinion is a resounding defense of Fourth Amendment rights in the digital age," he continued. "The courtâs withering rebuke of secret and warrantless use of invasive cell phone tracking technology shows why it is so important for these kinds of privacy invasions to be subjected to judicial review. Other courts will be able to look to this opinion as they address rampant use of cell site simulators by police departments across the country.
[end of portion quoted]
My opinion:  The purpose of a "warrant" is to make legal what would otherwise be illegal.  If an ordinary citizen used a stingray for this sort of surveillance, that would clearly be called illegal.  Therefore, police should be required to obtain a warrant in order to use a stingray.  (or, more properly, they shouldn't be allowed to do that at all.)

Seems somewhat over-hyped, and not especially new either.
        Jim Bell
"It could mean completely secure encryption of data, be it emails or voting - and even help beat climate change.
Researchers have revealed a groundbreaking new technique to create truly random numbers for the first time.
The new method creates truly random numbers with less computational effort than other methods, which could facilitate significantly higher levels of security for everything from consumer credit card transactions to military communications.
The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers,  such as air temperatures and stock market prices sampled over time, and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers.
'This is a problem I've come back to over and over again for more than 20 years,' said David Zuckerman, who led the study.Described by one cryptography expert as a 'masterpiece,' the University of Texas at Austin research could have wide ranging implications.
'I'm thrilled to have solved it.'Computer science professor Zuckerman and graduate student Eshan Chattopadhyay will present research about their method in June at the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), the Association for Computing Machinery's premier theoretical computer science conference. They publicly released a draft paper describing their method for making random numbers in an online forum last year. Oded Goldreich, a professor of computer science at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, commented that even if it had only been a moderate improvement over existing methods, it would have justified a 'night-long party.
'When I heard about it, I couldn't sleep,' says Yael Kalai, a senior researcher working in cryptography at Microsoft Research New England who has also worked on randomness extraction. 'I was so excited. I couldn't believe it. I ran to the (online) archive to look at the paper. It's really a masterpiece.'
The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers. Weakly random sequences, such as air temperatures and stock market prices sampled over time, harbor predictable patterns. Truly random sequences have nothing predictable about them, like a coin toss. The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers.
Previous versions of randomness extractors were less practical because they either required that one of the two source sequences be truly random (which presents a chicken or the egg problem) or that both source sequences be close to truly random. This new method sidesteps both of those restrictions and allows the use of two sequences that are only weakly random.
An important application for random numbers is in generating keys for data encryption that are hard for hackers to crack. Data encryption is critical for making secure credit card purchases and bank transactions, keeping personal medical data private and shielding military communications from enemies, among many practical applications.
Zuckerman says that although there are already methods for producing high-quality random numbers, they are very computationally demanding. His method produces higher quality randomness with less effort.
'One common way that encryption is misused is by not using high-quality randomness,' says Zuckerman. 'So in that sense, by making it easier to get high-quality randomness, our methods could improve security.'
Their paper shows how to generate only one truly random number â akin to one coin toss â but Zuckerman's former student Xin Li has already demonstrated how to expand it to create sequences of many more random numbers. Read more:

Blockchain Company's Smart Contracts Were Dumb
JUNE 17, 2016 5:46 PM EDT
Matt Levine
There's a fairly incredible trial going on in London right now. The Libyan Investment Authority is suing Goldman Sachs over some trades that they did together. To oversimplify slightly, the LIA handed Goldman a pile of money and signed some complicated contracts describing the circumstances in which Goldman would have to give LIA money back, and how much. And then everyone closed their eyes and counted to 10, and when they opened their eyes, poof, the money was gone. It was $1.2 billion. Libya is mad, and suing.
The LIA has various arguments in its lawsuit, but none of them amount to "Goldman owes us money under those contracts." The contracts specified a set of functions that took inputs (mostly, the prices of some bank stocks) and produced as outputs a set of dollar amounts that Goldman was supposed to pay Libya. The specifications in the contracts are perfectly clear; there's no dispute about how to read the contracts, or about how the functions work. Everyone agrees that the total dollar amount produced by the functions is zero. Instead, Libya's arguments take the form of: We didn't really mean what those contracts said. We didn't understand them. We were bamboozled into signing them, overwhelmed by a "swarm" of Goldman bankers, seduced -- literally -- by the bankers' offerings ofinternships and aftershaves and prostitutes. We were unsophisticated, we trusted Goldman to look out for our best interests, we thought the functions were something other than what they turned out to be.
Whatever you think about those arguments -- my own views are complicated -- they are definitely the kinds of arguments that are, like, allowed in court. The contracts specifying the functions are important. Ninety-nine-point-whatever percent of the time, derivatives contracts just work: I pay you a premium for a call option, and you promise to pay me if it ends up in the money, and if it does, you do, and if it doesn't, I shrug and walk away. We knew what we were getting into, and we got out of it what we expected. But every so often, people don't know what they're getting into, or what they get out of it isn't what either side reasonably expected. And when that happens, they go to court and argue about it. Usually one side did well out of the deal, and argues that everything's fine and everyone got what they expected; the other side did poorly, and argues that something fundamentally unfair happened and the deal should be altered.

entionally decentralized, meaning that anyone can use it to propose wagers,=
 anyone can bet on the outcome, and human judges known as reporters have a =
financial incentive honestly to decide whether the event happened or not. N=
o central authority exists to reject unacceptable, or illegal, wagers.
This week's media scare arose after a single person used the Augur protocol=
 to bet on whether President Donald Trump would survive 2018, and that pers=
on apparently placed the bet on a lark after a Twitter discussion.
Cue the frightened headlines:=C2=A0The=C2=A0Independent=C2=A0reported: "Don=
ald Trump assassination market appears on blockchain platform Augur."=C2=A0=
Newsweek: "Welcome to Augur, the cryptocurrency death market where you can =
bet on a Donald Trump assassination." Mashable may have been the most worri=
ed,=C2=A0declaring=C2=A0Augur "terrifying."
In reality, Internet assassination markets have existed for years. A=C2=A0F=
orbes=C2=A0article=C2=A0from 2013 described a self-proclaimed "Assassinatio=
n Market" that attempted to crowdfund murder with bitcoins. Bounties were e=
stablished on NSA Director Keith Alexander, President Obama, and Fed Chairm=
an Ben Bernanke (Bernanke's=C2=A0bounty, the highest, would be just over $1=
 million at today's bitcoin prices).
Five years later, those officials are still alive.
Human beings can be creative creatures when choosing to do evil, and one da=
y prediction markets may well be used for actual foul play. This is especia=
lly true when one person stands to gain a lot from harming another: Murders=
 have been committed to gain life insurance payouts. Worse, prediction mark=
ets could reward not only assassins, but criminals involved in mass shootin=
gs or terrorist attacks as well.
At least these public markets do one thing that underground payments-for-as=
sassination do not: they let the target know that he or she=C2=A0is=C2=A0a =
target. If you knew that there was a large bet that would pay off only if y=
ou died in the next 24 hours, you might want to take the appropriate precau=
tions, including a vigorous exercise of your Second Amendment rights. Hope =
your state doesn't require a waiting period! (There may be a market in bots=
 that, for a fee, will scour new Augur contracts for your name.)
This is probably why the CIA, which presumably never would favor the assass=
ination of a U.S. politician, seems to like prediction markets. A=C2=A02006=
 analysis=C2=A0published by the agency concludes that "the record of predic=
tion markets is impressive." It adds that "prediction markets can contribut=
e to more accurate estimates of long-term trends and threats and better cos=
t-benefit assessments of ongoing or proposed policies." And of course it wa=
s the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency that=C2=A0proposed=C2=A0a pr=
ediction market based on events such as regime change in the Middle East.
George Mason University economist Robin Hanson, whose work partially inspir=
ed DARPA, uses the history of short selling to suggest that the danger of f=
he New York World Trade Center were funded in part by trades of airline sto=
ck options. Similarly, some feared that the 1982 Tylenol poisonings were do=
ne to profit from short sales on the Tylenol stock. Airline stock prices di=
d fall on September 11, as did the Tylenol stock with the 1982 poisonings. =
And a study has found that Israeli stock and currency prices respond to Isr=
aeli suicide bombings. Thus, it is not crazy to think that terrorists might=
 use financial markets to profit from their acts. Nevertheless, we know of =
no examples of anyone using financial markets to profit from such sabotage.
The idea of arranging assassinations online through pseudonymous identifier=
s and paying in digital cash is not exactly new. It's been discussed for ne=
arly a quarter-century.
In September 1994, retired Intel engineer and polymath Tim May published=C2=
=A0The Cyphernomicon, a manifesto that said: "In my highly personal opinion=
, many people, including most Congressrodents, have committed crimes that e=
arn them the death penalty; I will not be sorry to see anonymous assassinat=
ion markets used to deal with them."
May included assassination markets in his list of what truly anonymous digi=
tal cash could accomplish. Such markets, he suggested, were merely one cons=
equence of what the wrecking ball of cryptographic technology would do to t=
he nation-state. Others included illegal markets in gambling, bribes, payof=
fs, insider trading, contract crimes, fencing, organ selling, and military =
and trade secrets. On the cypherpunks mailing list, May outlined an experim=
ental scheme called BlackNet to demonstrate anonymous information markets.
A few years later, Jim Bell, an MIT-educated anarchist, stepped in where Ma=
y left off. Bell published a 23-page essay with the provocative title "Assa=
ssination Politics." Bell's sketch of how this system would work argued tha=
t an "organization could quite legally operate, assisted by encryption, int=
ernational data networking, and untraceable digital cash, in a way that wou=
ld (indirectly) hasten the death of named people, for instance hated govern=
ment employees and officeholders."
The Forecast Foundation, the nonprofit group leading Augur's development, h=
as taken some steps to prevent their project from morphing into Assassinati=
on Politics or BlackNet. For instance, it added code to allow participants =
to reject transactions as unethical and therefore "invalid."
But different people=E2=80=93the ones acting as reporters=E2=80=93may reach=
 different conclusions about what transactions are unethical or invalid. Th=
e creators of Augur call this disagreement a potential fork. If there is a =
dispute, there are built-in ways to try to resolve it; if it cannot be reso=
lved, the market will be forked over a 60-day period.=C2=A0
A March 2018=C2=A0white paper=C2=A0calls forks a "nuclear option" that "are=
 expected to be exceedingly rare events." If a disagreement over bets on th=
e longevity of politicians ever arises, a Coindesk=C2=A0report=C2=A0suggest=
s there's a "possibility that Augur could fork into two platforms, one=E2=
=80=93call it Augur Dark=E2=80=93that tolerates assassination markets, and =
one that doesn't."
There are other ways the foundation could try to curb potential illegal wag=
ers, including altering the codebase to inject additional safeguards. But p=
articipants in the Augur marketplace would be free to ignore the alteration=
s. An intentionally=E2=80=93even radically=E2=80=93decentralized system is =
difficult to tame again once it's released into the wild.
The foundation has tried to distance itself from unlawful uses of Augur, st=
ressing on its website that it "has no power to censor, restrict, or curate=
 markets, orders, trades, positions or resolutions on the Augur protocol co=
ntracts." Earlier this week, it formally=C2=A0relinquished=C2=A0its ability=
 to shut down the network. Now the fate of Augur, and of its associated pre=
diction markets, now in the hands of its users.

@_subject: The Radical Potential Of Augur 
Just-launched Augur is clumsy, slow, ugly.=C2=A0.=C2=A0. and potentially wo=
As Augur co-founder Joey Krug=C2=A0put it,
Due to scaling woes on Ethereum, Augur will likely remain sluggish and cost=
ly for a few years. Throw in the fact that on first glance, Augur looks lik=
e little more than a place to bet on the winner of the World Cup, and it=E2=
=80=99s tempting to shrug it off as a clunky, overhyped DApp.
Don=E2=80=99t make this mistake.
Augur could transform how we forecast the future, make decisions and manage=
 risk in everyday life, fact-check and agree on the state of reality, and e=
ven hold politicians accountable. Someday, it may even be the world=E2=80=
=99s largest financial market.
ELI5: What Is This thing?
Augur has been called=C2=A0=E2=80=9CUber for Knowledge.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0Like =
unused cars sitting idly around, we all have information or insights lying =
dormant in our brains. Like calling an Uber, creating markets on Augur recr=
uits this idle information into action and transforms it into a shared reso=
Augur is the world=E2=80=99s first decentralized prediction market (DPM).=
If this sounds complicated and scary, you=E2=80=99re in the right place. I=
=E2=80=99m going to ELI5 (Explain Like I=E2=80=99m 5) exactly what a predic=
tion market is and why you=E2=80=99d want to decentralize it and what that =
even means.
DPM involves 3 parts. Let=E2=80=99s start with =E2=80=9Cmarket.=E2=80=9D
A market is place where people buy and sell things. That could be goods (th=
ink Amazon), services (think Uber), or financial assets (stock markets, pre=
diction markets etc).
Its called a =E2=80=9Cprediction=E2=80=9D market because its a place to buy=
 and sell=E2=80=A6predictions. You can sell your prediction at anytime, and=
 how much buyers will pay for it depends on how likely the market thinks th=
e prediction will come true. The more likely the market deems a prediction,=
 the more it will pay for it. Don=E2=80=99t worry if this sounds abstract, =
I=E2=80=99ll give an example in a minute.
Now, the last part: decentralized. This is a fancy way of saying there is n=
o central control. There is no single party that decides what can be predic=
ted on, who can predict, and whether a prediction is right or wrong. No sin=
gle party owns everyone=E2=80=99s data in the network. Augur runs on Ethere=
um which means all its data and code is distributed on thousands of compute=
rs around the world and is open to anyone.
Prediction markets are efficient at forecasting the future as they harness =
the =E2=80=9Cwisdom of the crowd.=E2=80=9D Since they have skin in the game=
, market actors buy more or less shares depending on their confidence level=
. Prediction markets attract folks with the most uncommon, least accessible=
 knowledge since they can most easily spot mispricings. This incents privat=
e, insider knowledge to flow into the public sphere.
Concrete Example
Let=E2=80=99s take a look at PredictIt, a traditional, centralized predicti=
on market. This will help break down how a prediction market works and the =
limits of=C2=A0centralized=C2=A0prediction markets as compared to Augur.
On PredictIt, you can buy and sell predictions on political outcomes. You m=
ake a prediction by buying one or more =E2=80=98shares=E2=80=99 in an outco=
me. A share is priced anywhere from 1 to 99 cents. If an outcome occurs, sh=
ares in it will be worth a dollar each. If an outcome does=C2=A0not=C2=A0ha=
ppen, shares in it will be worth nothing.
In this example, you can bet on whether Mark Cuban will run for president. =
You can buy YES shares at 25 cents each which means the market thinks there=
=E2=80=99s a ~25% chance he will run. Prices go up and down as the market r=
eacts to developments. For instance, if a major scandal surfaces about Cuba=
n next month, YES shares may plummet to 10 cents since many YES holders wil=
l sell their shares and buyers won=E2=80=99t be willing to pay as much as b=
If Cuban ends up running, then all YES shares will be worth a dollar and NO=
 shares will be worth nothing. If he doesn=E2=80=99t run, NO shares will be=
 worth a dollar and YES shares will be worth nothing.
Put differently: whenever you buy a share you are entering a contract with =
someone betting the opposite outcome and whoever is right will collect the =
combined amount of cash put into the contract by both sides (which always a=
dds up to a dollar) and whoever is wrong gets nothing.
In Augur, prices are denominated in Ether rather than USD, so if Mark Cuban=
 has a 25% chance of running, shares in this outcome would cost=C2=A0.25 et=
But where the real differences kick in is the decentralized part. On centra=
lized markets like PredictIt, only the organization that runs the site can =
start markets and report on prediction outcomes, traders can only bet limit=
ed amounts, and the market is prone to regulation and may be shut down at a=
ny time. You end up with a market that is too inefficient to make strong pr=
edictions and be used for interesting things.
Augur changes all this.
On Augur, anyone can create a market on anything. Imagine a Chilean farmer =
whose livelihood depends on rainfall. He could protect his family from drou=
ght by creating a market forecasting rainfall, and betting on a low amount.=
 If it ends up raining, great. But if it doesn=E2=80=99t, he still =E2=80=
=98makes it rain=E2=80=99 on Augur where he earns a payout from his hedge. =
Traditionally it would cost millions of dollars to start a market like this=
. With Augur it could be a few bucks.
In today=E2=80=99s world, only elite gatekeepers can open and close markets=
. With Augur, markets become like Wikipedia pages. Anyone can start or cont=
ribute to them. In other words, there will be markets for basically everyth=
ing. I think of Augur as sort of Wikipedia meets the Stock Market. It democ=
ratizes speculation.
In addition to creating markets, participating in markets opens up to anyon=
e anywhere. In today=E2=80=99s world, markets are segregated by borders and=
 capital controls. If you=E2=80=99re in China, for instance, it=E2=80=99s h=
ard to trade American stocks. With Augur, anyone anywhere can in theory get=
 exposure to any asset by speculating on its future value.
Free (almost)
In traditional betting and prediction markets, the house takes a steep cut.=
 On Augur, there=E2=80=99s no rent-seeking middleman, so costs are minimal.=
 There are still fees that serve to incent truth, but these are minimal.
Centralized speculation markets can be shut down or regulated at any time, =
which discourages participation. Due to regulation, Prediction markets like=
 Predictit have low betting limits. This prevents high confidence actors fr=
om betting enough to really move the markets and thus limits the markets=E2=
=80=99 predictive powers. Augur cannot be regulated like this since it is d=
istributed and peer-to-peer.
On a market like PredictIt, you have to trust a central source to resolve w=
hether or not a prediction came true. This makes it prone to arbitrary deci=
sions, and if you disagree with the verdict, you=E2=80=99re out of luck. On=
 Augur, participants collectively report on outcomes.
The Magic
Each of these perks are significant but when you fuse them together you get=
 the magic: an open, frictionless, borderless pool of liquidity that become=
s an=C2=A0efficient market=C2=A0for predicting the future and as we=E2=80=
=99ll soon see, determining present reality.
Boundless Possibilities
Obvious use cases like sports and political forecasting or using Augur to =
=E2=80=98short=E2=80=99 or get leverage on future cryptocurrency prices are=
 just the tip of the iceberg.
If you=E2=80=99re unsure whether to rent or buy an apartment, you could use=
 Augur to predict future housing prices in your area. If you=E2=80=99re hav=
ing a wedding, you could =E2=80=98insure=E2=80=99 against getting rained ou=
t by predicting a rainy day. Farmers could use Augur to hedge against the r=
isk of natural disaster.
Augur may replace polls and pundits as the go-to for political forecasting.=
 Just like you might ask Siri what the whether will be tomorrow, in the fut=
ure you might ask it who will win the presidential election, and it will sa=
y something like =E2=80=9Caccording to Augur, Dwayne Johnson has a 77% chan=
Augur could also be used for accountability. As one Reddit user=C2=A0wrote,
ther politicians will actually implement their own policies. In this hypoth=
etical crypto utopia, politicians would publicly demonstrate they had bough=
t lots of shares of the market stating they would implement X policy if ele=
cted. If they don=E2=80=99t, they would lose their own money.
Economist Robin Hanson has floated the idea of=C2=A0Futarchy, a new style o=
f governance in which citizens use prediction markets to bet on which polic=
ies will be most beneficial to national welfare. Politicians then enact the=
 policies that win out in the markets. Whether this would=C2=A0devolve into=
 plutarchy=C2=A0is yet to be seen, but it=E2=80=99s an intriguing idea.
DPMs also carry dystopian prospects such as =E2=80=9Cassassination markets=
=E2=80=9D where users bet on the date a given individual will die. This cou=
ld incent assassination since market actors will earn a payoff if they =E2=
=80=9Cpredict=E2=80=9D correctly while potentially skirting criminal liabil=
ity since they get paid for choosing the date correctly rather than committ=
ing the act. While this example may be far-fetched, the reality is that cen=
sorship-resistant prediction markets could be used to incent negative, as w=
ell as positive, outcomes.
But while Augur is censorship-resistant, the community plays a powerful rol=
e in determining whether predictions end up true, false or =E2=80=98invalid=
.=E2=80=99 This is where Augur=E2=80=99s token, REP (short for reputation),=
 comes into play.
REP is used to report on the outcomes of predictions and to incent honest r=
eporting. Reporters stake their REP on the outcome of a market. If their st=
ated outcome matches consensus, they earn settlement fees from the market. =
If their staked outcome differs from consensus, they lose their REP. But if=
 they still think they=E2=80=99re right, they can appeal by staking a large=
r amount of REP.
If it gets to the point where the REP bonds hit an upper limit and the netw=
ork cannot come to consensus, REP splits into multiple versions correspondi=
ng to each version of reality i.e., each prediction outcome. But since user=
s presumably want to predict in markets that accurately reflect reality, th=
is is an unlikely event.
So Augur can also be seen as a sort of truth engine that is not only effici=
ent at predicting the future but also at determining the present state of r=
eality. Market actors will be incented to report the news correctly, not in=
 a way that grabs attention, satisfies viewers=E2=80=99 bias, or pleases ad=
vertisers=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Aunlike traditional news outlets. This m=
ay be a powerful antidote to a world ridden by fake news, confirmation bias=
, and social media bubbles.
Today, Augur is hard to use, slow, and costly. Its success will ride not on=
ly on the hard work, tenacity and vision of its developers and community bu=
t on broader infrastructure improvements like sharding, stablecoins, and of=
fchain exchange (0x).
Augur is an ambitious experiment in trustless economy and its success is fa=
r from guaranteed. But its potential is staggering. While it won=E2=80=99t =
happen anytime soon, I think Augur has a real shot at someday becoming the =
world=E2=80=99s largest (financial) market. And I wouldn=E2=80=99t be oppos=
ed to buying some shares in this prediction...
As always, comments and criticisms welcome and please tell me if I got anyt=
hing wrong. For anyone interested in trading on Augur, if you want to toss =

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Augur=E2=80=99s_Joey_Krug_Comments_On_Assassination_Markets?= 
MATTHEW DE SILVA
Shortly after Augur=E2=80=99s launch, some users created cryptocurrency-set=
tled assassination markets. Since the Augur protocol exists on the Ethereum=
 blockchain, the marketplace exists across many computers. Because of Augur=
=E2=80=99s decentralization, law enforcement may struggle to shut down thes=
e morbid and highly illegal markets.
There's a frightening, niche segment of the=C2=A0cryptocurrency=C2=A0commun=
ity that is comprised of extreme anarchists. These people aren't just apoli=
tical, they're anti-political (to the point that they will facilitate bets =
on the lives of politicians). The thinking is roughly this: If there are fi=
nancial incentives to "off" politicians, then people will be afraid to run =
for office and thus, the=C2=A0state will collapse.
It might sound extreme, but assassination markets are not new phenomena. As=
 early as 2013, some=C2=A0bitcoin=C2=A0enthusiasts were contributing toward=
 assassination markets for prominent public figures including the US presid=
ent, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and leaders of US government agen=
cies. In November 2013,=C2=A0Forbes=C2=A0even profiled one of these market =
creators. Fortunately, nobody cashed in on those bets, which effectively fu=
nctioned as bounties.
When Augur launched earlier this month, it was only a matter of time before=
 cryptocurrency-tied assassination markets reappeared. Initially, Augur's m=
arket questions were relatively tame (e.g., "Will the price of=C2=A0Ether=
=C2=A0be above $500 at the end of 2018?" and "Will England win against Croa=
tia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup?" Spoiler Alert:=C2=A0England lost). However=
, in the last several days, darker questions were posted about the life of =
the US president and the lives of other public figures.
These assassination markets raise ethical questions for Augur's creators an=
d force us to confront a hideous side of society that seems to lurk in the =
seemingly pseudonymous depths of the internet. When=C2=A0ETHNews=C2=A0asked=
 Augur co-founder Joey Krug whether there's any way to censor these questio=
ns, he simply directed us to Augur's FAQs:
nd create markets on the Augur protocol. All functions of routing orders, m=
atching orders, processing trades,=C2=A0escrow=C2=A0funds, manage the order=
 book and resolve and settle markets are all operated and run on the=C2=A0E=
thereum=C2=A0blockchain=C2=A0itself through a set of=C2=A0smart contracts, =
the Augur core protocol. Miners running Ethereum nodes route, match, store =
and process orders, trades and markets on the Augur protocol. All funds are=
 escrowed and transferred directly on the Ethereum blockchain itself."
In short, Augur seems to be out of Krug's hands.
The responsibility instead lies with Augur's users (effectively any member =
of the public who has the technical know-how and financial wherewithal to p=
lace a wager). Another section on Augur's FAQ page explains, "Users of the =
Augur protocol must themselves ensure that the actions they are performing =
are compliant with the laws in all applicable jurisdictions and must acknow=
ledge that others' use of the Augur protocol may not be compliant. Users of=
 the Augur protocol do so at their own risk."
Note: This seems like an awfully convenient way for Augur's creators to dis=
claim responsibility, but we're left with the same old question: is the cre=
ator of a tool responsible for its usage?
Krug, for his part, doesn't seem worried about the assassination markets. H=
e said, "As far as whether I'm personally concerned, it's a bit like asking=
 the creators of SMTP if they're ok with email being used for ransom notes.=
 Obviously, I would prefer people not use the tool for such things!"
He continued: "That said, it's irrelevant what I think because if it is ill=
egal, market creators shouldn't be creating such markets anyway, just as pe=
ople should not write ransom notes with email."
Personally, it would be easy to be outraged and appalled by Krug's response=

Augur, a new blockchain-based prediction market platform, is getting a lot =
of media attention because people are using it to predict the deaths of cel=

=E2=80=9D could inspire real killings, the more urgent problem Augur presen=
ts is something else entirely.
This piece first appeared in our twice-weekly newsletter Chain Letter, whic=

=80=94it=E2=80=99s free!
Really, people saw these sorts of =E2=80=9Cdeath pools=E2=80=9D=C2=A0coming=
 decades ago, and blockchains, with their decentralized networks and (poten=
tially) anonymous transactions, serve as an ideal platform. Augur=E2=80=99s=
 open-source software relies on blockchain-based computer programs called=
=C2=A0smart contracts=C2=A0to let users set up their own prediction markets=
 that automatically pool cryptocurrency bets and distribute winnings withou=
t the need for participants to identify themselves. Perfect for ginning up =
interest in offing someone by guaranteeing a payday to whoever does the dee=
d, at least in theory. Predictably, the protocol, which launched July 10,=
=C2=A0has already led to markets=C2=A0for forecasting the demise of Donald =
Trump, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, Betty White, and others. But these marke=
ts have seen very few transactions, and the amounts wagered have been tiny,=
 making it unlikely they=E2=80=99d inspire someone to engage in foul play.
Nevertheless, Augur may already be facilitating illegal activity that could=
 prove far more troublesome.
In the US, prediction markets are generally not permitted. Federal and stat=
e laws prohibit online gambling, and =E2=80=9Cin many ways the line between=
 prediction markets and gambling is not that clear,=E2=80=9D says=C2=A0Aaro=
n Wright, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. Furthe=
r, some=C2=A0Augur contracts=C2=A0allow users to bet on the future value of=
 something, such as Ether cryptocurrency. That sounds a lot like a type of =
investment called a=C2=A0binary option, which is unlawful to list without a=
pproval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In 2012, the CFTC su=
ed Intrade, an Ireland-based prediction market, accusing it of permitting U=
S users to trade binary options, and eventually a judge blocked Intrade fro=
m offering the contracts in the US.
Sure enough, Augur already=C2=A0has the CFTC=E2=80=99s attention. But even =
if the agency decides that Augur is breaking the law, how will it enforce t=

When Napster, Limewire, and other peer-to-peer file-sharing networks starte=

That doesn=E2=80=99t mean laws can=E2=80=99t be applied=E2=80=94just that t=

Suppose people could get the data of their contact history (or
maybe they were running their own distributed voluntary p2p
WiFi proximity contact loggers and messaging apps),
or get tested, or receive treatment, completely anonymously,
just give them a unique ID number, no real ID asked.
Somewhat like the HIV epidemic or any other illness,
sometimes people want to know first, so they can come
to terms with it in a minute, then do what they have to do.
Imagine some high society tabloid person, or anyone really,
fucked an infected whore, or was getting coked up with Trump,
whatever the deal... are they really going to volunteer that path.
Maybe people want to self-confine at home and order
food delivery, instead of risk catching MRSA in hospital.
If I knew or thought I had some corona air/surface/touch
transmissible death plague, I'd immediately remove myself from
all such human contact, other than medical care, and tell the
hospital people to just throw the syringes to me from afar :)
Humans can be pretty cool like that.
Who but a psycho asshole would really want to knowingly
subject other people to such potential demise. Nothing
will stop them, or from doing other things.
Healthcare systems are often way more intrusive than they
need to be.
Many countries you can't even pay cash and sign a liability
release, to get an anonymous physical exam, a simple MRI,
some bloodwork, stitches, surgery, cancer, etc.
Nothing transmissible or involving someone else, or even
statistically trackworthy outlier condition, just routine shit.
Consider blood donation... it all gets screened before infusion.
They scream for donors, yet forbid anonymous donations,
won't even hand out a random seeded ID number so that
donors could voluntarily and privately check on their own bags.
What lot of good calling donors up is going to do after docs
already infused someone with a new bug. Just accept they'll
add a screen for that and move on. Quota demand solved.
Medical systems are also quietly giving and selling
DNA and data on the backside. Just like telecoms,
Facebook, Alexa, Ring, etc.
Unfortunately, like "temporary" taxes and laws,
too often turn out to be permanent.
Consider making the ones who dreamed up to call

but provided it is merited, not allow them to be
the ones who are running it and in control of
shutting it down. Let the trackees be the
authoritave brokers and pullback of their own data.

The new plan would use mobile-phone tracking technology to give a far more =
precise history of an infected person=E2=80=99s movements before they were =
diagnosed and identify people who might have been exposed.
In his address, Netanyahu acknowledged the technology had never been used o=
n civilians. But he said the unprecedented health threat posed by the virus=
 justified its use. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or mo=
derate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with exis=

=E2=80=9CThey are not minor measures. They entail a certain degree of viola=

y came into contact with while sick and what preceded that. This is an effe=

The proposal sparked a heated debate over the use of sensitive security tec=

 done with it.

The Full Story
Sometimes new drugs are found in unusual places. The antiparasitic drug ive=
rmectin was discovered in the 1970s in bacteria isolated from the soil on a=
 Japanese golf course. Ivermectin was called the first "endectocide" since =
it was active against both endoparasites (parasites that live inside the ho=
st) and ectoparasites (parasites that live on the outside of the host).
Ivermectin was initially developed as a veterinary antiparasitic drug. Of p=
articular importance today is ivermectin's ability to prevent heartworm inf=
ections in dogs with monthly dosing (e.g., Heartgard). Ivermectin has also =
protected hundreds of millions of livestock from a variety of parasites.
Ivermectin lotion is approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice. Un=
like many other treatments for head lice, ivermectin lotion only needs to b=
e applied once. When given orally, ivermectin can be used for treating head=
 or pubic lice and scabies (an itchy, highly contagious skin disease caused=
 by mites burrowing in the skin). Oral ivermectin is useful to control outb=
reaks of scabies in nursing homes where whole-body application of topical a=
gents is difficult.
Ivermectin's greatest impact on human health has been in Africa. Since 1987=
, in addition to its use for other parasitic infestations, ivermectin has b=
een used extensively to control onchocerciasis with 1.4 billion treatments =
so far. Onchocerciasis is also called "river blindness" because the blackfl=
y that transmits the disease breeds in fast-moving streams and rivers. Once=
 within the body, the adult female worm produces thousands of juvenile worm=
s that migrate to the skin and eyes and can produce severe itching and eye =
injury that can lead to blindness.
Ivermectin kills the juvenile worms, but not the adult females. The effecti=
veness of the drug lasts up to 12 months, but mature female worms produce o=
ffspring for 15 years, so ivermectin has to be taken once a year for that l=
Over 300 million people take ivermectin each year. To date, ivermectin has =
been shown to be a safe and well-tolerated drug. Most adverse reactions are=
 mild and temporary, such as loss of appetite, headache, muscle aches, lack=
 of energy, and fever. There have been a small number of severe adverse eve=
nts and even some deaths in humans treated with ivermectin in onchocerciasi=
s-control programs. The reason for these events is unknown, but they might =
be linked to the presence of large numbers of other parasites that are kill=
ed off in treated patients.
If you suspect someone has swallowed ivermectin, do not make the person vom=
it. Immediately check the=C2=A0webPOISONCONTROL=C2=AE=C2=A0online tool for =
help or call Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222.
When ivermectin gets in the eyes, minor irritation and redness can occur. S=
erious eye injury is not likely, but the eyes should be rinsed immediately.=
 Remove contact lenses and use lots of room temperature water. For children=
, pour water onto the bridge of the nose and let it gently run into the eye=
s. Encourage blinking. After rinsing, call Poison Control or use the=C2=A0w=
ebPOISONCONTROL=C2=A0tool for help.

onfirmed, despite concerns from civil-liberties advocates that the practice=
 would raise serious privacy issues. The official spoke on condition of ano=
nymity pending an official announcement.
Netanyahu announced his plan in a televised address late Saturday, telling =

Israel has identified more than 200 cases of the coronavirus. Based on inte=
rviews with these patients about their movements, health officials have put=
 out public advisories ordering tens of thousands of people who may have co=
me into contact with them into protective home quarantine.
The new plan would use mobile-phone tracking technology to give a far more =
precise history of an infected person=E2=80=99s movements before they were =
diagnosed and identify people who might have been exposed.
In his address, Netanyahu acknowledged the technology had never been used o=
n civilians. But he said the unprecedented health threat posed by the virus=
 justified its use. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or mo=
derate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with exis=
ting health problems, it can cause more severe illness.
=E2=80=9CThey are not minor measures. They entail a certain degree of viola=
tion of the privacy of those same people, who we will check to see whom the=
y came into contact with while sick and what preceded that. This is an effe=
ctive tool for locating the virus,=E2=80=9D Netanyahu said.
The proposal sparked a heated debate over the use of sensitive security tec=
hnology, who would have access to the information and what exactly would be=
 done with it.
Nitzan Horowitz, leader of the liberal opposition party Meretz, said that t=
racking citizens =E2=80=9Cusing databases and sophisticated technological m=

liberties.=E2=80=9D He said any use of the technology must be supervised, w=
