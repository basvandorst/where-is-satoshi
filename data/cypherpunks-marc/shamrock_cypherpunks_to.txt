FREE GUN TRAINING FOR COMMERCIAL PILOTS
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA:  In the aftermath of the World Trade
Center attack, Front Sight Firearms Training Institute,
which claims to be the world leader in providing intensified
courses in the defensive use of firearms for private
citizens and law enforcement alike, feels they have the
answer to stopping commercial airliners from being used as
ballistic missiles.  Front Sight will train every commercial
pilot in the world FREE OF CHARGE in the defensive use of
the handgun.  Front Sight will accept for training all
certified pilots and co-pilots from all commercial airliners
that submit a request for training on commercial airliner
letterhead, designating the pilot and co-pilot to carry a
handgun in the cockpit to defend access to the airliner. The
request for training letter must have the notarized
signature of the airline's chief executive.
Front Sight's Founder and Director, Dr. Ignatius Piazza
understands that his offer may offend those who lack resolve
in stopping terrorists from turning airliners into weapons
of mass destruction. However, he is quick to point out that
the World Trade Center attack is a new realm of terror, not
previously witnessed in the world. Prior to the World Trade
Center attack, terrorists were content to hijack planes and
divert them to safe landings in exchange for negotiated
release of imprisoned comrades. In extreme cases, terrorists
have committed suicide by exploding the grounded plane.
Airliners have also been targeted with bombs and possibly
missiles to spectacularly explode in flight, killing all on
board.  The World Trade Center attack was a new form of
terrorism, where the commercial airliner, loaded with fuel
for a cross country flight is redirected from the cockpit
and turned into an accurate missile of mass destruction.
Front Sight knows this form of terrorism can be stopped
immediately by arming all pilots and co-pilots and training
them in the proper methods of defending their cockpits.
"Commercial airliners must be willing to take an
uncompromising stand that will not allow anyone, under any
circumstances to access the controls of an airliner," says
Piazza. "The pilot and co-pilot, are responsible for the
security of the cockpit.  Without a handgun to defend it,
the cockpit crew is easily defeated.  However, when both
pilot and co-pilot are armed and trained by Front Sight,
they have the tools, ability, and will to defend themselves
and repel the murderous intent of terrorists. In an
emergency, the pilot can fly the plane to a safe landing
while the co-pilot covers the door of the cockpit- ready and
willing to use deadly force to prevent anyone from opening
the door."
Dennis Vied, a retired TWA Captain with 28 years of
experience flying commercial airliners and Front Sight
student fully agrees with Front Sight's solution.  Captain
Vied states, "The terrorists knew that they would face no
opposition to the hijacking, once they managed to get on the
airplane. All they had to do was threaten to do something to
a passenger, and they would be allowed access to the
cockpit. If that didn't work, then they just had to hurt
somebody, which in this case they did. Apparently they cut
the throats of two of the flight attendants. The terrorists
knew they would face no armed opposition, because the
airline screening process would insure that nobody on the
airplane would be armed. We have such an abhorrence to guns
that we fail to allow the good people to arm themselves for
defense. Therefore they are at the mercy of bad people- in
this case the terrorists. I sincerely hope that this is a
wakeup call to America. I think they should arm the crews,
or at least allow those that want to be armed to do so.
Otherwise, you're at the mercy of some crazy son-of-a-bitch
armed with a box cutter! How absolutely absurd!  There is so
much emphasis on prevention, and precious little emphasis on
the ultimate lines of defense."
Aaron Benedetti, a United Airline 747 co-pilot since 1990 is
a Platinum member at Front Sight and has already attended
Front Sight courses in defensive handgun, tactical shotgun,
and practical rifle. Through Front Sight's training,
Benedetti is ready, willing and able to defend the cockpit
of his aircraft if given the proper tools and authority to
do so.  Benedetti states, "We get recurrent training
regarding hijacking and security procedures, but the
training centers around placating and negotiating with the
terrorists to safely land the plane. We are told not to make
any aggressive move and to work toward a calm outcome.  The
World Trade Center disaster is a real blind spot in our
training. The attack reveals that perhaps the only way the
pilots could have stopped it would have been to deny access
to the cockpit and stop the terrorists from taking over the
controls of the plane by any means possible.  In the future,
we should consider that with the cockpit doors locked and
the co-pilot guarding the door with a handgun, calm
negotiations can still take place via intercom to land the
plane safely thus avoiding another World Trade Center
scenario."  Aaron Benedetti recommends all airlines to take
advantage of Front Sight's solution and offer.  He returns
to Front Sight later his year for further training on his
Lieutenant Bob Redmond, SWAT Commander of Nye County
Sheriff's Department concurs that Front Sight's training is
exactly what the commercial airliners need and that they
should immediately begin sending their pilots to Front
Sight. Redmond, who sends his SWAT officers to Front Sight
for firearms and tactical training states, "Front Sight's
training exceeds levels offered by most if not all law
enforcement agencies throughout the country.  Front Sight's
training is so good that I want every officer we have in the
department to attend every course Front Sight offers. If
airlines sent their pilots to Front Sight, it would be like
having SWAT officers in the sky."
Mark Donovan, a pilot for Southwest Airlines, who has taken
over ten Front Sight courses in the last two years finds the
current situation of unarmed pilots rather incredulous.
Donavan explains, "The political climate in commercial
aviation prior to the World Trade Center attack has not been
conducive to arming pilots.  In fact, just the opposite has
occurred.  Airlines have disarmed pilots to the point where
a terrorist with a box cutter can take over control of a
plane because no one is armed to defend the plane or
themselves.  Yet, numerous federal agencies are allowed to
carry a gun on commercial airlines, including such dubiously
qualified agencies as, Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, and the
Smithsonian Institution!  Why are federal agents from these
obscure agencies allowed to carry a gun on board when a
pilot with firearms training from Front Sight Firearms
Training Institute is not allowed? My training at Front
Sight far exceeds anything the federal government offers to
these agencies."  Donovan continues, "If we, as pilots are
not given the means and authority to defend our aircraft as
a last means of defense, then who will?  It is apparent that
time was not available to negotiate with the madmen in the
World Trade Center attack.  Clearly, a properly trained
flight crew with a handgun could have saved countless lives.
Front Sight offers this training. I urge all federal
decision  makers to seriously examine Front Sight's solution
to the problem.  I believe it is the only credible answer to
stopping another horrendous tragedy."
Front Sight is the Solution to Gun Violence
Piazza reiterates, "Front Sight is truly part of the
solution to gun violence in this country.  Everyone agrees
that law enforcement should have the very best training
available.  Front Sight provides it.  And everyone agrees,
regardless of what side of gun control one stands, that if
law abiding private citizens are going to own firearms they
should be trained.  Front Sight provides such training to
levels that exceeds the law enforcement community.  Front
Sight now offers the solution to stopping and forever
preventing another World Trade Center attack by training
commercial airline pilots to be that last line of
defense for their passengers, airline, and our country.
Front Sight stands ready, willing, and able to serve."

LOL. Greg ran a remailer long before you apparently knew what a remailer
was. Greg, as most of us who first subscribed to this list in 93 or 94,
undoubtedly long has made up his mind as to the societal and individual
benefits of encryption technology and remailers. What I find puzzling is
where along the way we picked up the fair-weather "Cypherpunks" who are
still grappling with Nomen's questions.
Even more puzzling is that the discussion of crypto vs. safety is taking
place at all. Crypto is out there, never to return back into the folds of
governmental or law enforcement control. The horse had left the barn in the
early 90's. It is /long/ gone. Even if the US were to outlaw the use of
unescrowed encryption by every resident of the this planet today, it would
have *zero* impact on the availability of strong crypto to criminals and
terrorists. Banning crypto would not increase anybody's safety. Except
perhaps the safety in office of dictatorial incumbent politicians. Which is
no concern of mine.
Of course, those calling for a ban on strong crypto are fully aware of this
undeniable fact. Preventing terrorists from using crypto is not their
objective, increasing the safety of you and me is not their goal.
It is controlling our speech and thoughts that they are after. But they get
there without the cooperation of the gullible.

Oh and Im sure having guns on board planes would work out great
especially considering the increase of people having huge fucking fits
and having to be held down on planes, yeah, lets arm people on planes.
Ignoring for a moment if it is indeed true that more airline passengers are
"having fits" (which is doubtful, but irrelevant to the point that I am
about to make) and furthermore ignoring why passengers may become
increasingly verbal about the unacceptable treatment they receive, I dare
say that there would be a rapid decrease in physical outbursts by
individuals on airplanes if a good number of the passengers were armed.
At gun ranges across the country, where just about everybody is armed,
physical violence is virtually nonexistent. Ever wonder why this is the
case? After thinking about it for a while, even the slower ones amongst us
might be able to figure out the cause.

@_subject: RE: Manhattan Mid-Afternoon 
Which of course represents the crux of the issue. The passengers aboard the
aircraft, the workers in the towers, and the emergency personnel on the
ground are dead for two reasons: the US unreasonably meddling in other
People's affairs until they crack, and the extremist gun control measures in
place in the US today, preventing law-abiding citizens from carrying the
firearm of their choice aboard a commercial aircraft. Who could deny that a
few citizens armed with their personal handguns could have stopped two or
three of guys armed with mere box cutters?
The nasty truth is that the tragic events of the day were to a large degree
caused by the victim disarmament policies of Diane Feinstein, Sarah Brady,
Chuck Schumer, and the many, many local, state, and federal proponents of
gun control. I hope they are happy. Not that I have any doubt that they will
be delighted, since today's tragedy will undoubtedly give them additional
excuses to turn more of us into helpless victims, ready to fall prey to
crazies with box cutters and politicians with a pathological desire to feel
The public will applaud. ... Or will it this time?

Something must be done about that. How about passing a law that all smoke

The latest releases of both Suse and Mandrake are both able to install
kernels with Freeswan already integrated.  It's a little newer addition
to Mandrake, so you may want to use Suse.  Suse makes it easy to set up
encrypted file systems and other nice features.
The major problem that holds back the development of FreeS/WAN is with
its management.  [Management that cares more about sitting on its
pulpit, than getting useful software into the hands of people.] Unless
things have changed recently, they still won't accept contributions from
the US.  This makes no sense.  GPG is shipping with every Linux
distribution I know of, and the German's take contributions from the US.
The primary kernel developers have been willing to integrate crypto into
the kernel since the crypto regs were lowered.  It's the policy of no US
contributions that's holding back Linux IPSEC.
IMHO:  If Freeswan had never been created, an alternate, more mature
implementation would already exist in the mainline Linux kernel.

The big question is: will FreeS/WAN latest release after some 4 or 5
years of development finally both compile and install cleanly on current
versions of Red Hat Linux, FreeS/WAN's purported target platform?
--Lucky, who is bothered by the fact that most his Linux using friends
so far have been unable to get FreeS/WAN to even compile into a working
kernel, while just about every *BSD distribution - and for that matter
Windows XP - ship with a working IPSec implementation out-of-the-box.
A number of small improvements have been added to this release, which
was shipped on-time.
Some highlights:
* Diffie-Hellman group 5 is now the first group proposed.
* Two cases where fragmentation is needed will be handled better, thanks
   to these two changes
        The code that decides whether to send an ICMP complaint back
        a packet which had to be fragmented, but couldn't be, has gotten
        smart enough that we now feel comfortable enabling it by
   and
        IKE (UDP/500) packets which were large enough to be fragmented
        to be mishandled, with some of the fragments failing to bypass
        tunnels properly.  This has been fixed; our thanks to Hans
* If Pluto gets more than one RSA key from DNS, it will now try each
   This will help when a system administrator replaces a key.
* There is preliminary support for building RPMs.
* SMP support is better.
* The team has eliminated a vulnerability that might permit a denial of    attack.
     We are in the process of chasing down a couple of significant bugs
     have been there since at least 1.92 and possibly earlier), and we
     ship another release quite shortly if we nail them down and fix
them.  If
     we don't, we won't.  Barring that possibility, the next release is
     for the end of January; a more precise date will be announced

for the hardware, it simply is underpowered. You can spend man-months
trying to fight the current underpowered Palm platform or you can use
the sufficiently-resourced PowerPC platform. Since I don't believe that
there is a requirement for the feature to operate on a device already in
the user's possession, I know what my choice would be. YMMV.
The OS is really of secondary or tertiary concern here. The more
important question is which (if any) handheld hardware supports
full-duplex audio. Do we know for fact that the lack of full duplex
audio support on the VoIP handheld demo is due to lack of support in the
HW or could it be a lack of support in the WinCE OS?

The reason why I have little faith in the Sectra Tiger is because I talked

Lucky:	How did Secrta solve the key distribution problem in the military
version of your product adopted by the Swedish army?
Sectra:	We are using a central key server.
Lucky:	How does the system respond to a failure of the central key
Secrta:	The hansets revert to a system-wide default key installed in the
handset at time of manufacture. The key is idential for all handsets.
Lucky: [Pause]. I see... Do you believe that a communication
system that depends for its security on the enemy ignoring your central
key server to be suitable for military applications? What if somebody
destroys the key server?
Secrta: [Visibly surprised by the question]. But we live in times of
peace! Why would anybody wish to destroy the key server?

Not to my knowledge. As for European-manufactured phones, the
best-known such phone is probably the German Rhode & Schwarz TopSec
handset. Rhode & Schwarz is of course the same company that sells a DEM
300,000 IMSI catcher targetted at the domestic German market and
an outbound-call-only GSM interception station for "export-only"
applications. The customer may wish to take the conflicting interests of
the manufacturer into account when making a purchasing decision.
The other well-known end-to-end encrypting phone is the Swedish Tiger
product initially designed for the Swedish military market. Having
participated in architectural discussions with the designers of the
device, I would recommend against its purchase.
In summary, at present trustworthy end-to-end encrypting GSM handsets are
not available in the market place.

Being rather familiar with cryptographic implementations for the Palm
platform, I would strongly recommend against attempting to use Palm as a
voice encryption device. The platform simply lacks the horsepower to do
so. This won't change until Palm starts rolling out their next
generation ARM based devices late this year. Of course since the current
underpowered Palm platform is continuing to lose the adoption rate fight
against PocketPC, basing any new product on the future availability of
next-generation Palm devices places the software developer's business
model at risk.

Are you disputing that Bernstein's paper offered improvements to the

[The LNE node bounced my first attempt at sending this email since it
exceeded the length constraints. My apologies if you are receiving this
email twice].
As those of you who have discussed RSA keys size requirements with me
over the years will attest to, I always held that 1024-bit RSA keys
could not be factored by anyone, including the NSA, unless the opponent
had devised novel improvements to the theory of factoring large
composites unknown in the open literature. I considered this to be
possible, but highly unlikely. In short, I believed that users' desires
for keys larger than 1024-bits were mostly driven by a vague feeling
that "larger must be better" in some cases, and by downright paranoia in
other cases. I was mistaken.
Based upon requests voiced by a number of attendees to this year's
Financial Cryptography conference , I assembled and
moderated a panel titled "RSA Factoring: Do We Need Larger Keys?". The
panel explored the implications of Bernstein's widely discussed
"Circuits for Integer Factorization: a Proposal".
Although the full implications of the proposal were not necessarily
immediately apparent in the first few days following Bernstein's
publication, the incremental improvements to parts of NFS outlined in
the proposal turn out to carry significant practical security
implications impacting the overwhelming majority of deployed systems
utilizing RSA or DH as the public key algorithms.
Coincidentally, the day before the panel, Nicko van Someren announced at
the FC02 rump session that his team had built software which can factor
512-bit RSA keys in 6 weeks using only hardware they already had in the
A very interesting result, indeed. (While 512-bit keys had been broken
before, the feasibility of factoring 512-bit keys on just the computers
sitting around an office was news at least to me).
The panel, consisting of Ian Goldberg and Nicko van Someren, put forth
the following rough first estimates:
While the interconnections required by Bernstein's proposed architecture
add a non-trivial level of complexity, as Bruce Schneier correctly
pointed out in his latest CRYPTOGRAM newsletter, a 1024-bit RSA
factoring device can likely be built using only commercially available
technology for a price range of several hundred million dollars to about
1 billion dollars. Costs may well drop lower if one has the use of a
chip fab. It is a matter of public record that the NSA as well as the
Chinese, Russian, French, and many other intelligence agencies all
operate their own fabs.
Some may consider a price tag potentially reaching $1B prohibitive. One
should keep in mind that the NRO regularly launches SIGINT satellites
costing close to $2B each. Would the NSA have built a device at less
than half the cost of one of their satellites to be able to decipher the
interception data obtained via many such satellites? The NSA would have
to be derelict of duty to not have done so.
Bernstein's machine, once built, will have power requirements in the MW
to operate, but in return will be able to break a 1024-bit RSA or DH key
in seconds to minutes. Even under the most optimistic estimates for
present-day PKI adoption, the inescapable conclusion is that the NSA,
its major foreign intelligence counterparts, and any foreign commercial
competitors provided with commercial intelligence by their national
intelligence services have the ability to break on demand any and all
1024-bit public keys.
The security implications of a practical breakability of 1024-bit RSA
and DH keys are staggering, since few of the following systems as
currently deployed tend to utilize keys larger than 1024-bits:
- HTTPS
- SSH
- IPSec
- S/MIME
- PGP
An opponent capable of breaking all of the above will have access to
virtually any corporate or private communications and services that are
connected to the Internet.
The most sensible recommendation in response to these findings at this
time is to upgraded your security infrastructure to utilize 2048-bit
user keys at the next convenient opportunity. Certificate Authorities
may wish to investigate larger keys as appropriate. Some CA's, such as
those used to protect digital satellite content in Europe, have already
moved to 4096-bit root keys.
Undoubtedly, many vendors and their captive security consultants will
rush to publish countless "reasons" why nobody is able to build such a
device, would ever want to build such a device, could never obtain a
sufficient number of chips for such a device, or simply should use that
vendor's "unbreakable virtual onetime pad" technology instead.
While the latter doesn't warrant comment, one question to ask
spokespersons pitching the former is "what key size is the majority of
your customers using with your security product"? Having worked in this
industry for over a decade, I can state without qualification that
anybody other than perhaps some of the HSM vendors would be misinformed
if they claimed that the majority - or even a sizable minority - of
their customers have deployed key sizes larger than 1024-bits through
their organization. Which is not surprising, since many vendor offerings
fail to support larger keys.
In light of the above, I reluctantly revoked all my personal 1024-bit
PGP keys and the large web-of-trust that these keys have acquired over
time. The keys should be considered compromised. The revoked keys and my
new keys are attached below.

@_subject: 1024-bit RSA keys in danger of compromise 
As those of you who have discussed RSA keys size requirements with me
over the years will attest to, I always held that 1024-bit RSA keys
could not be factored by anyone, including the NSA, unless the opponent
had devised novel improvements to the theory of factoring large
composites unknown in the open literature. I considered this to be
possible, but highly unlikely. In short, I believed that users' desires
for keys larger than 1024-bits were mostly driven by a vague feeling
that "larger must be better" in some cases, and by downright paranoia in
other cases. I was mistaken.
Based upon requests voiced by a number of attendees to this year's
Financial Cryptography conference , I assembled and
moderated a panel titled "RSA Factoring: Do We Need Larger Keys?". The
panel explored the implications of Bernstein's widely discussed
"Circuits for Integer Factorization: a Proposal".
Although the full implications of the proposal were not necessarily
immediately apparent in the first few days following Bernstein's
publication, the incremental improvements to parts of NFS outlined in
the proposal turn out to carry significant practical security
implications impacting the overwhelming majority of deployed systems
utilizing RSA or DH as the public key algorithms.
Coincidentally, the day before the panel, Nicko van Someren announced at
the FC02 rump session that his team had built software which can factor
512-bit RSA keys in 6 weeks using only hardware they already had in the
A very interesting result, indeed. (While 512-bit keys had been broken
before, the feasibility of factoring 512-bit keys on just the computers
sitting around an office was news at least to me).
The panel, consisting of Ian Goldberg and Nicko van Someren, put forth
the following rough first estimates:
While the interconnections required by Bernstein's proposed architecture
add a non-trivial level of complexity, as Bruce Schneier correctly
pointed out in his latest CRYPTOGRAM newsletter, a 1024-bit RSA
factoring device can likely be built using only commercially available
technology for a price range of several hundred million dollars to about
1 billion dollars. Costs may well drop lower if one has the use of a
chip fab. It is a matter of public record that the NSA as well as the
Chinese, Russian, French, and many other intelligence agencies all
operate their own fabs.
Some may consider a price tag potentially reaching $1B prohibitive. One
should keep in mind that the NRO regularly launches SIGINT satellites
costing close to $2B each. Would the NSA have built a device at less
than half the cost of one of their satellites to be able to decipher the
interception data obtained via many such satellites? The NSA would have
to be derelict of duty to not have done so.
Bernstein's machine, once built, will have power requirements in the MW
to operate, but in return will be able to break a 1024-bit RSA or DH key
in seconds to minutes. Even under the most optimistic estimates for
present-day PKI adoption, the inescapable conclusion is that the NSA,
its major foreign intelligence counterparts, and any foreign commercial
competitors provided with commercial intelligence by their national
intelligence services have the ability to break on demand any and all
1024-bit public keys.
The security implications of a practical breakability of 1024-bit RSA
and DH keys are staggering, since of the following systems as currently
deployed tend to utilize keys larger than 1024-bits:
- HTTPS
- SSH
- IPSec
- S/MIME
- PGP
An opponent capable of breaking all of the above will have access to
virtually any corporate or private communications and services that are

Any such hard drives that I have seen keep the actual encryption key
utilized in firmware on the drive, using the password provided during

useless against invasive analysis by an attacker with a modicum of skill

One very promising project underway to get us closer to the goal of

for inclusion in the release of FreeBSD 5.0. (GEOM also will provide a

If I understand you correctly, you are saying that the latest version of

that are encrypted using IDEA. Which could be fixed quite easily.
And then I believe I hear you saying that there are ancient version of

Which is true. My archival copy of Netscape 0.9 beta has a hard time

[Written originally in response to a post on Cryptography. --Lucky]
Allow me to shed at least some light on the strange phenomenon that you
experienced for I have experienced the same phenomenon and was able to
glean at least a few of the reasons why application authors and
maintainers have proven so reluctant to increase RSA key sizes or
mandate minimum key sizes in their applications.
1) Very, very few applications, and no cryptographic libraries that I am
aware of, that currently employ RSA perform any kind of sanity check on
the size of the keys. The current release version of various programs
that I looked at will happily accept a 4-bit RSA client key that anyone
could factor in their head. VeriSign not too long ago signed a 384-bit
SSL server key that may readers of this list could break with the old
computers in their home. Such certificate signing practices, or their
lack thereof, are nothing short of irresponsible.
I have not tested the following hypothesis and am not willing to spend
the required $125 on the experiment, but I would not be in the least
surprised if many public CA's would readily sign a certificate for a
4-bit RSA key. C.f. the "being caught with one's pants down" observation
in my previous post. If somebody want to perform this experiment, better
do it quick, since the CA vendors read this mailing list. :-)
There are some positive examples: as a result of my original post, the
next release version of OpenSSH will enforce a 768-bit minimum size on
the key. I have not been following the discussion that lead to the
determination of this figure and therefore  don't know on which
cryptological results the OpenSSH designers based that number.
However, I note that even those experts that I am aware of which assert
that 1024-bit keys are sufficient for the type of long-term use SSH
client keys are frequently employed for do not appear to claim that
768-bit keys should be considered secure today.
Unfortunately, the OpenSSH designers have chosen to not expose the
minimum key size requirement via the sshd configuration file, though at
least there now there will be a known spot in the source that can easily
be patched to a value the server operator might consider to be more in
line with current key size recommendations. I thank the OpenSSH team for
at least providing an easy hook to make the desired changes in the
source, though of course I would like to see both a larger default and a
corresponding option in the config file. Still, hats off to the OpenSSH
team for moving implementing sanity checks that few other vendors have
bothered to implement.
Some other deployed applications either use libraries that can't go
higher than 1024-bits or have the key sizes and structures hard coded
all over the source, making a chance expensive and uneconomical absent
severe customer pressure on the vendor. A much cheaper solution than
rewriting good chunks of the core crypto processing code (or worse,
having to upgrade hardware that is limited to 1024-bits) is putting out
a press release stating why the customer doesn't need keys larger than
1024-bits, which some claim is one of the many reason why there is so
much resistance to moving to larger keys. I am not quite ready to
subscribe to such cynical a view point, but I heard that view point
voiced by several crypto old-timers in private conversations more than
2) One frequently voiced argument against increasing key sizes is the
resultant decrease in performance. Yes, it is absolutely true that
increasing the size of an RSA key leads to a decrease in performance.
However, larger keys decrease performance less than naive experiments
may seem to indicate. For many applications, generating a 2048-bit key
and comparing the performance with that of a 1024-bit key will lead to
numbers that differ widely, much more so than can be attributed to the
larger key size. The reason for this phenomenon is that RSA algorithm performance is
highly dependent on optimizations that are both key size and processor
specific. The same optimization strategy that will give you blazingly
fast performance with a 1024-bit key will absolute kill performance with
a 4096-bit key, for which a different optimization strategy is needed.
Similarly, optimizations are highly processor specific. An optimization
designed specifically for a Pentium III processor will run slower on a
Pentium IV than your basic Pentium optimized code would.
Some applications offer the correct optimizations for each key size.
Others just optimize for 1024-bit keys, thus leading to abysmal
performance with some larger keys.
Example: PGP appears to offer excellent performance optimizations across
all key sizes. The performance difference between a 1024-bit RSA key and
a 4096-bit key can't be much more than a second. (I didn't directly time
this, but I can hear when the outgoing mail from my laptop hits the mail
spool on my SMTP server; the increase in lag is insignificant from a
user perspective).
OpenSSH with 4096-bit keys on both ends on a 450 and 333 MHz machine
respectively is noticeably slower than with 1024-bit keys, perhaps by a
couple of seconds, but still well within user tolerance. I suspect
additional optimizations are possible which would decrease the lag
PuTTY SSH, on a 750MHz CPU with a 4096-bit key on both sides simply
crawls. I am looking at some 12+ seconds before I see the shell prompt
from the same 333MHz server used in the example above. Apparently,
optimizations for larger keys are missing from this program.
In summary, I would like to see more applications that are currently
utilizing RSA to enforce sanity checks on the keys with reasonable
defaults, offer the administrator a choice to change these defaults via
a configuration option that doesn't require patching the source, and see
more applications that use RSA processing code to utilize key
size-specific optimizations, which would significantly decrease the
currently experienced performance differences with many of those

Anonymous wrote (quoting Adam):
Rather than continuing with guesses by those that were not present at
the time as to my motivations and objectives behind my post, allow me to
establish the facts and thought processes that lead to my original post.
Prior to the panel at FC, I held the belief that 1024-bit RSA keys could
not be factored in an operationally significant timeframe irrespective
of the budget of the attacker. I know that this belief was held by many,
if not most, of the implementers of cryptographic production systems and
believe that it was held by many, if not most, cryptographers. In some
sense, if this belief had not been held so widely, current debate would
not be as heated.
So let's look at the supposed mistakes Anonymous asserts I made:
1) As is the case with many panel discussions, and in many cases the
reason for choosing a panel format rather than an individual presenter,
the panelists, Ian Goldberg and Nicko van Someren, were selected to
represent subject matter experts in different areas of relevance to the
subject to be discussed: Ian's role was to help determine the
mathematical impact and correctness of Bernstein's proposal: are the
mathematical assumptions correct? Did the author make a mathematical
error in the paper? Ian did not identify errors in the math, though
cautioned that the interconnections required by an actual device would
represent a challenge of significant engineering impact. (Which, as
Nicko addressed in his previous posts to this list, he too considered to
be the limiting factor on performance).
Having thus established, as well as it could been established at the
time, that the paper that triggered the discussion appeared to not
contain mathematical errors, Nicko, as the subject matter expert in
building cryptographic hardware implementations, presented what the math
meant from an engineering perspective. In particular, can a device be
built based on the mathematical assumptions, how much would it cost to
build such a device, and what would the device's operating
characteristics be?
It is correct that Nicko presented estimates that literally were being
refined during the panel session. Naturally, I would not have even
considered posting such hasty generated estimates to a widely-read
mailing list. (More on that later).
Interestingly enough, the reaction to the estimates from the attendees
at the conference, which contained many well-known cryptographers, was
quite different from what I would have expected. Nobody stood up, and FC
is a conference quite amenable to open discussion, that they found the
suggestion that 1024-bit RSA could be broken by a well-resourced
attacker in operationally significant times to be unrealistic. The most
vocal comment in the ensuing discussion came from Yvo Desmedt, who
pointed out that no expert in the field should be surprised by these
results, since it was pointed out in Beth, Frisch, and Simmons
"Public-Key Cryptography: State of the Art and Future Directions, LNCS
578, published in back 1992, ten years ago, that 1024-bit keys would be
suitable for protection against a national adversary for about another
10 years: until about 2002. As it so happens, this the year 2002.
Given how panels are assembled and the role they fulfill, I thought it
would be understood that when one writes that certain results came out
of a panel that this does not imply that each panelist performed the
same calculations. But rather that that the information gained from a
panel (Ian: math appears to be correct, Nicko: if the math is correct,
these are the engineering implications of the math) are based on the
combined input from the panelists. My apologies if this process of a
panel was not understood by all readers and some readers therefore
interpreted my post to indicate that both Ian and Nicko performed
parallel engineering estimates.
2) Immediately after the panel, a reporter for the Financial Times in
attendance approached me, inquiring if these estimates had already been
published in the media. I told him that I was not aware of any such
publications and that this was the first time I had heard these
estimates. He informed me that he intended to publish this information
in a matter of days. I don't know if he wrote the article or not; I am
not a Financial Times subscriber.
It was not until at least a week after FC that I contacted Nicko
inquiring if he still believed that his initial estimates were correct,
now that that he had some time to think about it. He told me that the
estimates had not changed. We now, after the calculations had been made
public and because the calculations had been made public, that Nicko's
calculations contained an oversight which was not discovered until much
later. While the oversight changed the speed by which a 1024-bit RSA key
could be broken by such a device, no correction to the calculations that
I have seen so far indicated that 1024-bit keys could not be broken in
an operationally significant time frame well below the expectations of a
large percentage of users that had fielded 1024-bit systems.
In short, the information I relayed was as authorative as any
information you are likely to obtain from a panel discussion. If you
want information to be more authorative, you would have to cite a
research paper on the topic. Papers that I am sure we all hope will be
written soon. One might hold that only security-relevant information
that represents the long-term universal consensus of the academic
community should ever be distributed to the public. I respectfully
disagree with this viewpoint.
Given the above, I fail to see the foundation for the claims made by
Anonymous that I relayed the information to the community hastily or
presenting it as anything other than what it was: new (at least to me)
and interesting information with potentially significant security
implications to a potentially wide number of current users of public key
cryptography-based authentication and confidentiality systems.
3) One of the claims Anonymous makes is that I revoked my key
precipitately. I did indeed upgrade the entire security infrastructure
under my direct control to keys larger than 1024-bits following the to
me new estimates indicating the feasibility of attacking such keys. And
I didn't enjoy the process. There is an old saying, of which I heard
varying versions over the years in the cryptographic community, which is
also published in AC, though I don't know if it originated with Bruce or
predates the publication of AC. The saying is that there are two kinds
of cryptography: the kind that will keep your kid sister from reading
your writings and the kind that will keep national governments from
reading your writings. Of the two, it is the latter kind that interests
me and that presumably interests most working in the field.
Since my original post, even some of the loudest voices in support of
the position that 1024-bit keys are safe have published tables that
indicate that 1024-bit keys are expected to be breakable by a
well-resourced attacker in a few years, if they are not already. See the
RSA Labs FAQ and Bruce's recent Cryptogram for some of those estimates,
both of which are readily available on the web. I have seen similar
tables in other communications.
A key size which that is widely considered to be insufficient to offer
security against passive cryptanalytical attack by a dedicated attacker
and its customers is not a key size that I consider desirable. Nor is
this the level of security many customers of cryptographic products are
told they are afforded by 1024-bit keys.
Since Moore's Law has made it faster for me to use a 2048-bit key today
than it was for me to use a 1024-bit key back when I began using
1024-bit key on a daily basis as an alpha tester of PGP 2.0, the logical
step was to upgrade key sizes. Was my doing so precipitately? One could
argue that it was unscheduled. The sole reason why the upgrade was
unscheduled was because I previously failed to act on the results of the
various key size viability studies starting with Beth and Frisch, moving
to the NIST recommendations quoted in the RSA Lab's FAQ, to Bruce's 1995
figures republished in his latest Cryptogram in which he pointed out
that he predicted 7 years ago that 1024-bits should not be considered
sufficient against a well-resourced attacker by the year 2000. If there
is one mistake related to my action surrounding this debate that I
perhaps can reasonably be chastised for, it is that I failed to remove
1024-bit keys from my security infrastructure sooner.
As Bruce put it in his Cryptogram: "To me, the big news in Lucky Green's
announcement is not that he believes that Bernstein's research is
sufficiently worrisome as to warrant revoking his 1024-bit keys; it's
that, in 2002, he still has 1024-bit keys to revoke."
How the anonymous author of the post criticizing my action of
publicizing that I, and dozens of attendees at a cryptographic
convention, heard evidence that 1024-bit keys are in danger of
compromise hopes to gather support for his contention  from my having
failed to revoke my keys sooner is beyond my comprehension.
To just make a minor comment on Bruce's quote, Bernstein's paper simply
triggered the discussion now underway. Looking back at all the expert
predictions, from the workshop in 1992, to Bruce's estimates from 1995,
to the NIST recommendations years ago, it appears that time and Moore's
Law have simply crept up on us and nobody really noticed.
Which brings us to why the current discussion is so heated and my post
is by some considered to be so "alarmist": just about everybody with a
few notable exceptions, from the community, to the vendors, to the
public failed to act on the numerous expert predictions that all stated
the same fact for a decade: 1024-bit RSA keys are either breakable today
or will be so very shortly. To put it bluntly, a good percentage of us
have been caught with their pants down. In many cases leaving their
customers with deployed, difficult to upgrade, security infrastructures
that were either built or selected based on our recommendations.
Some of us, myself included, chose to bite the bullet, take the painful
remedial actions, and confess to it in public. Others chose to pursue a
different response, in some cases quoting predictions that state that
1024-bits are either already breakable today or will soon be breakable
while simultaneously asserting that by-and-large 1024-bit keys are good
enough. Others continue to insist that 1024-bit keys are unbreakable and
will remain so for the lifetime of a deployed system irrespective of how
well resourced the attacker. I sincerely hope they are correct, but
based on what I know now, I am no longer willing to base a security
infrastructure on that hope. Nor would I recommend doing so to others.
As always, I have faith that now that the interest has been raised and
the predictions of old have been dusted off and republished, the
scientific process will fulfill its role to determine fresher, more
accurate figures.
I fully agree that higher levels of details lead to faster, more
efficient analysis and a more efficient scientific process. What further
complicates matters is that the resolution of this question has
significant implications to many of the participants in the discussion.
And while healthy disagreement between participants helps further the
state-of-the art, some of these disagreements may lend themselves to
misinterpretation by interested, and potentially impacted, observers
outside the community.
For example, Bruce has been quoted in a widely-cited eWeek article that
"I don't assume that someone with a massive budget has already built
this machine, because I don't believe that the machine can be built".
Bruce shortly thereafter stated in his Cryptogram newsletter that "I
have long believed that a 1024-bit key could fall to a machine costing
$1 billion."
Since these quotes describe mutually exclusive view points, we have an
example of what can happen when a debate spills over into the popular
media. The only way to avoid such confusion would be to exclude those
outside of the cryptographic community from the discussion by not
communicating with the information intermediaries that the press
represents. But given that the enterprise and the public places their
faith into the results of our work, and given the potentially large
implications if 1024-bit keys are subject to cryptanalysis, I believe
that those directly impacted by this issue have a right to know about
it. I therefore am quite unapologetic for not having limited my report
on the interesting events that took place at Financial Cryptography 2002
to a post to sci.crypt. Not that doing so would have necessarily ensured
that the debate would not spill over outside the cryptographic

@_subject: Transparent disk encryption coming this year [was:RE: disk 
I would like to direct anybody's attention who is interested in
transparent drive encryption to GEOM, which will be a native feature of
FreeBSD 5.0.
GEOM is a project that is slated for inclusion in the release of FreeBSD
5.0, a major upgrade to FreeBSD that has been years in the making, due
out by the end of the year. Based on my understanding of what GEOM does,
which may be imperfect, GEOM provides a transparent middle layer between
the actual physical drives and what the OS thinks those drives are. For
example, the OS may believe it is using two UFS partitions on the same
IDE drive when in fact the actual drives used are one hard drive
formatted for Linux, one MS-DOS drive, and some Solaris partition
mounted over NFS. The OS or the application will be completely isolated
from the physical hardware of the drives and the actual file systems on
the drives.
The benefits are compelling: you can simply add another drive and tell
your OS that one of the partitions that it is using has just magically
become much larger. Or move all the data over to a RAID without your OS
ever changing the device entry it is talking to. As I said, totally
I believe that GEOM will become widely adopted, just as Soft Updates
became widely adopted within months of its inclusion in FreeBSD, because
it is simply so compelling.
Of course this magic requires various behind-the-scenes
"transformations". One of such transformations that the author is
explicitly targeting is transparent encryption. And that's not just
encryption of blocks on the file system or via some kludgy loop back
interface. If this gets implement right, if you were to look at the
physical drive, you shouldn't even be able to tell how many files there
are, or for that matter how much data is stored on the drive.
Currently, GEOM is being written by a single guy in Denmark. Which
sounds perhaps more crazy than it might be, because Soft Updates, IIRC,
was written by one person as well. The guy seems real, has a grant for
the project, and is an active member of the FreeBSD team.
If you feel comfortable with running FreeBSD-CURRENT, which was just
released as a Developer Preview 1 build, are familiar with at least some
file systems, and are interested in seeing transparent drive encryption
deployed on hundreds of thousands of machines worldwide by the end of
the year, I would encourage you to visit  and read the geom man page found on the
FreeBSD web site. Note that the encryption transformation code is not
yet available, though some of the file system transformation code is.

@_subject: RE: attack on rfc3211 mode (Re: disk encryption modes) 
Here is a partial list of requirements that I believe apply to drive
encryption cryptographic systems. I am sure that list is incomplete and
may contain errors. The following is what springs to mind:
1) I do not believe that there is a fundamental need to limit the size
of the ciphertext to the size of the plain text. Adding a 1% or even
more space overhead for encryption is acceptable under any day-to-day
scenario that I can think of.
2) The algorithm must be able to decrypt individual sectors without
having to decrypt the entire contents of the drive. Nor must the
algorithm leak any plaintext, even if the attacker were to have
knowledge of all but one byte of the plaintext stored on the drive.
3) The encrypted partition should leak no information about the number,
nature, and size of any files stored on the drive. Unless one has access
to the key, the entire partition should be appear to the observer as a
homogenous block of opaque encrypted data.
4) It would be nice, but is not in the least required, to be able to
convert an existing unencrypted partition to an encrypted partition and
5) It must be possible to pass the encryption key as a parameter to
mount, presumably in the form of a config file containing they key to
prevent the key from showing up in ps.
6) It should be possible to both specify a raw AES key as well as a
passphrase-derived SHA2 generated AES key.
7) Since the key will need to be stored in RAM for extended periods of
time, the key should be protected from forensic recovery by being never
being swapped to disk as well as by periodic bit-flipping.
8) Ideally, and this is definitely a feature for v2.0, each user would
be able to specify a capability that will permit the listing and access
of any files under that user's permissions on the encrypted file system.
9) While steganographic file systems offering multiple levels of
credible distress keys are nice, I don't consider this a feature that
should be included in v1.0.

Peter is correct in that there is a gigantic bulge of money that circles
the globe each day, following the sun. Though the reason for this
constant circulation isn't primarily to obtain the best interest rate on
the cash. The reason why this bulge of cash keeps circling the globe is
actually much more interesting than a desire to obtain the highest
interest rates.
Let's say you are running a world-wide trading house with operations
around the globe. Let's further assume your European operation shows
$50B in cash on the books. What exactly does it mean for a business
entity to have a certain amount of cash on the books? It means that this
entity can show that amount to be present in their accounts during
auditing hours. Which usually equates to business hours. So, here is
what is really happening:
The moment trading closes in your European operation's time zone, the
European operation transfers the $50B to your US operation. Leaving the
European operation with no cash in their accounts until the next
morning. Once trading closes in the US, the US operation transfers the
same $50B to the Asian operation. Which in turn will later transfer
those $50B to the European operation, just in time before they open up
their doors again in the morning.
The result? Your global operations can show a total of $150B of cash on
the books when in fact there were never more than $50B at any given
Such practices (and several variants thereof; similar games can be
played with commodity futures, etc.) are not just legal, but standard
procedure at global trading houses and just about any outfit of
significant size that both has accounts containing cash and runs
world-wide operations. Why account for the same dollar only once if you
can account for it 3 times?
That's the reason why this trillion dollar bulge of money keeps circling
the globe each day, every day, following the sun (or perhaps more
precisely, the effective hours of the auditing rules).

You may be asking yourself: where, oh where, has all the crypto gone?
Where are the BlackNet's? Where is the untraceable Ecash? Where is the
Cryptanarchy that we've been waiting for? For that matter...where is the
The staunchest Cypherpunk will by now have noticed that PGP/GPG usage
even amongst list members, once the bellwether indicator of Cypherpunks
crypto adoption success, is in decline.
NAI has pulled PGP off the shelves. Conspiracy theories as to what may
have been driving this business decision abound. The fact of the matter
is that the usage of PGP by businesses, the sole significant source of
NAI PGP revenue, had long passed its peek. How many business do you know
that rolled out PGP in the last year? How many do you know that quietly
stopped using PGP after formally adopting its use with big fanfare a few
years ago? The facts are that there are more of the latter than of the
former. Did NAI receive The Briefing? I don't know. Nor does it really
matter. There wasn't enough money to be made with PGP.
A well-respected Cypherpunk recently expressed hope that if NAI's PGP
were to disappear for good, perhaps compatibility problems amongst
versions of PGP would diminish. A plausible sounding theory, if one were
to assume that the compatibility problems amongst versions of PGP are
between versions produced by different vendors. Presumably, the theory
would go, with only one major supplier left standing, that being GPG
(yes, I am aware there are others), interop problems with other vendors'
implementations would pretty much disappear by definition.
However, a closer inspection of the PGP interoperability problems, which
have been at one of the issues coming up in just about every single
discussion I've had with anybody about PGP over the last year, shows
that the interop problems are not between current versions by multiple
vendors, but between versions, in some cases by the same vendor, that
were released over time. The current version of NAI-PGP will
interoperate just fine with the current version of GPG.
So why is PGP interoperability such a frequently raised issue? And why
does the importance of this topic seem to diminish the further away you
stray from Cypherpunks into the realms of the casual PGP users? The
answer to the second question is straight-forward. Even the most casual
user of software tends to be familiar with and acceptant of the need for
occasional software upgrades. It appears that those that are
experiencing interop problems are those that are insisting on using up
to 5-year old versions of PGP. It is true and should come as no surprise
that those 5-year old versions do indeed have interop problems with
newer versions of PGP.
Some may say: I shouldn't need to keep on upgrading my software to be
able to send encrypted email. Does anybody seriously believe that those
that insist on using 5-year old versions of PGP have not upgraded their
operating systems in those 5 years? Indeed, upgraded more their
operating systems more than once? Or does anybody seriously believe that
those that insist on using old versions of PGP still run the exact same
version of their MUA and text editor as they did 5 years ago? Of course
they don't. If they did, their boxes would long have become unusable due
to the warez traffic taking place on the machines as a result of the
countless remote exploits discovered over these last 5 years.
The reluctance to upgrade to a newer version of PGP does not appear to
be driven by a refusal or inability to upgrade software in general. This
reluctance to upgrade appears PGP specific. Why this is the case I do
not know. (And don't greatly care. I am running the latest version of
NAI PGP and I can make my copy talk to any version of PGP 2.x or
Now perhaps there may be the rare case of a PGP user that is still
running PGP 2.x on the same DOS box, using the same mailer and the same
text editor as they did 5 years ago. I don't know of any such users, but
that doesn't mean no such users exists within the vastness of the
Internet. What I do know is that those that I am aware of that are
complaining about PGP version interoperability problems do not fall into
the rare category of users who have not upgraded any software at all for
the last 5 years.
Since the existence of multiple PGP software providers has not been the
cause of the interop problems experienced by some, reducing the number
of PGP implementation providers should not be expected to have a
significant impact on the number or severity of PGP interop problems
experienced by the users.
The same Cypherpunk expressed a hope that absent NAI's PGP, the German
government group currently funding GPG might be more inclined to fund UI
work for Windows. Perhaps they would. Assuming for a moment they will,
would this lead to a better PGP Windows UI than NAI's PGP offered? NAI's
PGP UI is pretty darn good. Looking at the sorry state of UI's currently
offered for GPG, even with government funding, I suspect that it will be
a long time indeed before we will see a GPG UI that will compare
positively to the current NAI PGP UI. Of course Cypherpunks know that it
is dangerous to base one's hope for the development of a Cypherpunk
tools on funding by a government. Be that the US government or the
German government. Strongly pro-crypto German governmental officials
have been know for their propensity to stumble out of the windows of
high story buildings. Warnings regarding the dangers that may lure in
parking lots come to mind.
Where has the crypto gone? The crypto has gone under the hood, away from
the UI, to a place where the crypto will be of most use to the average
user. Yes, for crypto to be secure against the active, well resourced,
attacker, the crypto must at one point touch the user to permit the user
to make a trust decision. But to secure communications from passive
and/or less resourced attacker, crypto can be placed under the hood.
I bet a good percentage of the readers of this list that still require
to be engaged in a form of employment nowadays access their company
network via some form of VPN. Up by orders of magnitude from a few years
ago. More importantly, a good percentage of users that have never heard
of this mailing list and will never hear of this mailing list are using
strong crypto to access their company's information. The percentage of
users utilizing strong crypto is increasing daily.
Another major segment of Internet infrastructure in which strong crypto
is rapidly becoming the default rather than the exception, at least
amongst those running their own servers, is SMTP. The percentage of SMTP
connections to my mail server that use TLS to encrypt SMTP has grown
from around 30% a few months ago to well over 60% today. This increase
in the use of STARTTLS on SMTP appears to parallel a loss of sendmail
MTA market share in favor of postfix. It is just too darn easy to turn
on support for STARTTLS during a migration to postfix, hence most sites
performing such a migration appear to do so.
(I am aware that sendmail and qmail support STARTTLS as well, but the
increases in the use of STARTTLS that I am seeing at my SMTP server
coincides with sites switching MTA's to postfix. I see a handful of
qmail sites using TLS, representing a fraction of the postfix sites, and
no sendmail site that I have noticed. Having once considered activating
STARTTLS in sendmail myself, I vividly recall myself reading the
instructions, bursting out laughing, followed by my researching
competitive MTA's. Within a week I had switched to postfix. Wished I had
done so years ago. All these hours that I wasted over those years...
An interesting side-effect of the increased adoption of MTA's and MUA's
that support STARTTLS is that I now have a link that is secure against
passive eavesdroppers to the majority of those with whom I regularly
correspond in encrypted email. Is protection against only passive
eavesdroppers good enough for me? No. Are we a heck of a lot further
along than we were 5 years ago? I would argue that we are.
Where has all the crypto gone? It has gone mainstream. Some of you may
remember the discussions from years ago how we should try to find a way
to make crypto cool and attractive for the average person.

Acts that are potentially slightly illegal and certainly considered
naughty by some carry more appeal to many than acts that are
unquestionably as above board as they are boring. Once the export regs
changed and more advanced uses of cryptographic applications failed in
the market place, crypto lost some of its sex appeal to its initial
early-adopter rebel constituency.
I believe our viewpoint coincide, rather than conflict. Crypto has gone
under the hood, it is used by anybody accessing an https website, which
nowadays is just about anybody with a web browser. Crypto is used by
many corporate employee's accessing the corporate VPN. It is the rare
Internet user, of which there are of course many more than there were
Cypherpunks got started, that does not employ strong crypto in some
Agreed. Which is why I pointed out that the encryption taking place
under-the-hood tends to be a reasonable defense against a passive or
less-resourced attacker while being frequently unsuitable against the
active, well-resourced attacker. Though I would contend that there are
more of the former than there are of the latter, I too continue to
utilize, as I pointed out, strong crypto that requires active user
interaction permitting the trust decision to occur. I indeed consider passive encryption methods alone to be typically
insufficient for some of my personal security needs and am continuing to
utilize encryption that requires me as the user to make that trust
decision. But that does not mean that no security benefits are to be had
from opportunistic encryption of Internet traffic.
Example: the other day I sent an email to a friend that accidentally
failed to PGP encrypt. The email did not contain truly critical
information, but I certainly would have preferred for neither my
friend's nor my ISP to have ready access to the cleartext of that email.
Fortunately, we had encrypted SMTP connections end-to-end, thus
protecting the contents of the email from the ISP's, albeit perhaps not
from the NSA.
Lastly, allow me to address the issue raised that many IM protocols in
use today do not support crypto at this time. This is true, but I
noticed that a good majority of the P2P efforts introduced at CODECON
all included support for encryption as part of the protocol. The various
developers had read Applied Cryptography, understood a sufficient part
of it, and made provisions to design crypto into their protocols from
the beginning rather than as an adjunct to be thought about later. While
the details of the initial implementations were of varying quality, one
project began by using Blowfish in ECB mode until the developer realized
that he could see patterns in the ciphertext, but changing a protocol
during alpha testing to use a secure mode of a block cipher given that
the protocol already contains all the hooks for crypto, may be
considerably easier than gluing crypto onto some of the existing IM
Given the rapid changes in the P2P space, just because some IM and P2P
systems today fail to offer cryptographic protections should not be
taken as an indicator that these protocol's successors will not offer
transparent crypto as a default feature.
One such project that I have been somewhat following is the Anonymous
IRC project. While their design is far from perfect, it is one of many
steps into the right direction. There are dozens of similar projects underway, all employing crypto,
that may one day replace the prevalent IM clients as rapidly as Gnutella
and later Kazaa and Morpheus replaced Napster.
How does the increased use of strong crypto under-the-hood help
Cypherpunks? The answer reminds me of the response another Cypherpunk
gave to my posting statistics about the nature of the USENET traffic
seen by a major node. I expressed surprise at these rather revealing
statistics, musing that there had to be a lesson to be learned from the
fact that the bulk of the data is generated in newsgroups that one would
not initially consider mainstream. His response was illuminating: "Yes,
the lesson is: just look at all that cover traffic".

@_subject: Two additional TCPA/Palladium plays 
[Minor plug: I am scheduled to give a talk on TCPA at this year's DEF
CON security conference. I promise it will be an interesting talk.
 ]
Below are two more additional TCPA plays that I am in a position to
1) Permanently lock out competitors from your file formats.
From Steven Levy's article:
"A more interesting possibility is that Palladium could help introduce
DRM to business and just plain people. It's a funny thing," says Bill
Gates. "We came at this thinking about music, but then we realized that
e-mail and documents were far more interesting domains."
Here it is why it is a more interesting possibility to Microsoft for
Palladium to help introduce DRM to business and "just plain people" than
to solely utilize DRM to prevent copying of digital entertainment
It is true that Microsoft, Intel, and other key TCPA members consider
DRM an enabler of the PC as the hub of the future home entertainment
network. As Ross pointed out, by adding DRM to the platform, Microsoft
and Intel, are able to grow the market for the platform.
However, this alone does little to enhance Microsoft's already sizable
existing core business. As Bill Gates stated, Microsoft plans to wrap
their entire set of file formats with DRM. How does this help
Microsoft's core business? Very simple: enabling DRM for MS Word
documents makes it illegal under the DMCA to create competing software
that can read or otherwise process the application's file format without
the application vendor's permission.
Future maintainers of open source office suites will be faced with a
very simple choice: don't enable the software to read Microsoft's file
formats or go to jail. Anyone who doubts that such a thing could happen
is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the case of Dmitry
Skylarov, who was arrested after last year's DEF CON conference for
creating software that permitted processing of a DRM-wrapped document
file format.
Permanently locking out competition is a feature that of course does not
just appeal to Microsoft alone. A great many dominant application
vendors are looking forward to locking out their competition. The beauty
of this play is that the application vendors themselves never need to
make that call to the FBI themselves and incur the resultant backlash
from the public that Adobe experienced in the Skylarov case. The content
providers or some of those utilizing the ubiquitously supported DRM
features will eagerly make that call instead.
In one fell swoop, application vendors, such as Microsoft and many
others, create a situation in which the full force of the U.S. judicial
system can be brought to bear on anyone attempting to compete with a
dominant application vendor. This is one of the several ways in which
TCPA enables stifling competition.
The above is one of the near to medium objectives the TCPA helps meet.
[The short-term core application objective is of course to ensure
payment for any and all copies of your application out there]. Below is
a mid to long term objective:
2) Lock documents to application licensing
As the Levy article mentions, Palladium will permit the creation of
documents with a given lifetime. This feature by necessity requires a
secure clock, not just at the desktop of the creator of the document,
but also on the desktops of all parties that might in the future read
such documents. Since PC's do not ship with secure clocks that the owner
of the PC is unable to alter and since the TCPA's specs do not mandate
such an expensive hardware solution, any implementation of limited
lifetime documents must by necessity obtain the time elsewhere. The
obvious source for secure time is a TPM authenticated time server that
distributes the time over the Internet.
In other words, Palladium and other TCPA-based applications will require
at least occasional Internet access to operate.
It is during such mandatory Internet access that licensing-related
information will be pushed to the desktop. One such set of information
would be blacklists of widely-distributed pirated copies of application
software (you don't need TCPA for this feature if the user downloads and
installs periodic software updates, but the user may choose to live with
application bugs that are fixed in the update rather than see her unpaid
software disabled).
With TCPA and DRM on all documents, the application vendor's powers
increase vastly: the application vendor can now not just invalidate
copies of applications for failure to pay ongoing licensing fees, but
can invalidate all documents that were ever created with the help of

distributed or on who's computer the documents may reside at present.
Furthermore, this feature enables world-wide remote invalidation of a
document file for reasons other than failure to pay ongoing licensing
fees to the application vendor. To give just one example, documents can
be remotely invalidated pursuant to a court order, as might be given if
the author of the document were to distribute DeCSS v3 or Scientology
scriptures in the future DRM protected format. All that is required to
perform such an administrative invalidation of a document is either a
sample copy of the document from which one can obtain its globally

[Bram is correct, stifling competition is one of the many features TCPA
will enable. In more ways than one. And for more players than just
Coincidentally, Steven Levy's article that Bram is citing also helps
answer Mr. Anonymous's question with which he challenged Ross and myself
earlier today.
First, however, I must apologize to the reader for my earlier, now
incorrect, statement that TCPA member companies would deny that DRM is
an objective of the TCPA. I had been unaware that, as evidenced by the
publication of the Newsweek article, the public phase of the TCPA effort
had already begun. What a bizarre coincidence for this phase, after all
those years the TCPA effort and its predecessors have been underway,
(the design, and in fact the entire architecture, has morphed
substantially over the years) to be kicked off the very day of my post.
[Tim: do you recall when we had the discussion about the upcoming
"encrypted op code chips" at a Cypherpunks meeting in a Stanford lecture
hall? Was that 1995 or 1996? It cannot have been later; I know that I
was still working for DigiCash at the time because I remember giving a
talk on compact endorsement signatures at the same meeting].
From Levy's article:
"Palladium [Microsoft's TCPA-based technology - LG] is being offered to
the studios and record labels as a way to distribute music and film with
"digital rights management" (DRM). This could allow users to exercise
"fair use" (like making personal copies of a CD) and publishers could at
least start releasing works that cut a compromise between free and
locked-down. But a more interesting possibility is that Palladium could
help introduce DRM to business and just plain people. "It's a funny
thing," says Bill Gates. "We came at this thinking about music, but then
we realized that e-mail and documents were far more interesting
Another paragraph of the Newsweek article has this to say:
"In 1997, Peter Biddle, a Microsoft manager who used to run a paintball
arena, was the company's liason to the DVD-drive world. Naturally, he
began to think of ways to address Hollywood's fear of digital copying.
He hooked up with [...] researchers Paul England and John Manferdelli,
and they set up a skunkworks operation, stealing time from their regular
jobs to pursue a preposterously ambitious idea-creating virtual vaults
in Windows to protect information. They quickly understood that the
problems of intellectual property were linked to problems of security
and privacy.
        They also realized that if they wanted to foil hackers and
intruders, at least part of the system had to be embedded in silicon,
not software."
Well, now that Bill Gates himself is being quoted stating that DRM was a
driver behind the technology the TCPA is enabling (Microsoft is one of
the companies that founded the TCPA and should be in a position to
know), does Mr. Anonymous consider this sufficient "evidence that the
TCPA is being designed for the support of digital rights management
(DRM) applications"? Or does Anonymous continue to believe Ross and
Lucky are making this stuff up out of whole cloth?
To answer Anonymous's question as to whether the "the TCPA [is] really,
as [Ross and Lucky] claim, a secretive effort to get DRM hardware into
consumer PCs?", I am not sure I would exactly call this fact a secret at
this point. (Though by no means are all cards already on the table).
DRM is a significant objective of some of the TCPA's member companies,
which includes Microsoft.
There are of course other objectives. Some of which Ross published, some
which I mentioned, some which Steven Levy has published (though he
largely fell for the designated bait and missed the numerous hooks),
some which Bram has realized, and some which have yet to be talked
about. Some desirable, some questionable, and a lot of them downright

One might read the decision this way, if the Supreme Court had not
specifically written that "The second amendment means no more than that
it shall not be infringed by Congress".
The national government is simply mentioned in the decision because the
question at bar was if the 2nd applied to the States via the 14th. Under
Cruikshank, the Supreme Court ruled that it does not. The Court held
that the 2nd only constrained the national government, not the States,
and of the national government, only Congress.
Under Presser, such an executive order by the President would likely be
considered unconstitutional.
FYI, the Supreme Court has since revisited, and overturned itself, in
just about every aspect of Cruikshank, *except* that the 14th does not
extend the 2nd to the States. Which was the issue that Steve Schear

@_subject: RE: 2 Challenge Gun Cases, Citing Bush Policy 
Steve is correct that the question if the 2nd Amendment imposes limits
on the ability of the States to regulate arms closely relates to whether
the Supreme Court holds that the 14th Amendment extends 2nd Amendment's
reach to the States.
However, the answer to this question is not one that will need to be
decided in the future. It has been decided over 125 years ago in one of
the first test cases of the then new 14th Amendment
In United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1876), the Supreme Court
held that:
"The government of the United States, although it is, within the scope
of its powers, supreme and beyond the States, can neither grant nor
secure to its citizens rights or privileges which are not expressly or
by implication placed under its jurisdiction. All that cannot be so
granted or secured are left to the exclusive protection of the States."
"The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is
it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The
second amendment means no more than that it shall not be infringed by
Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the
national government." As you can see by reading the entire case, the Court held not only that
the 14th Amendment does not extend the 2nd Amendment to the States, but
also held that the States are free to regulate firearms at their
leisure, in effect, the Court held that the 2nd Amendment solely
constrains Congress from infringing upon the right to keep and bear arms
while leaving the Executive free to infringe upon this right, or deny
its exercise entirely, at will.
In their ruling, the Supreme Court of course utterly ignored the
legislative history of the 14th Amendment that shows that the 14th
Amendment was put in place precisely to ensure, amongst other civil
rights, that the newly freed blacks would be able to arm themselves as a
protection from their militarily beaten, but no less racist, white
Under Cruikshank, Congress may not pass a bill infringing on the right
of the citizens to keep and bear arms, but a Presidential Executive
Order that all private citizens are to turn in their guns tomorrow
passes Constitutional muster.
The Supreme Court slightly soften their contention that the 2nd
Amendment was not worth the parchment it is written on (at least when it
comes to, horrors, blacks with guns) ten years later in Presser v.
Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886).
"The provision in the Second Amendment to the Constitution, that 'the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,' is a
limitation only on the power of Congress and the national government,
and not of the States. But in view of the fact that all citizens capable
of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force of the national
government as well as in view of its general powers, the States cannot
prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the
United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public
security." Unfortunately, while at first glance being rather favorable to the right
to keep and bear arms, Court in Presser did not overturn the Court's
earlier determination in Cruikshank that the 14th Amendment does not
extend the 2nd Amendment to the States. While the Court has in the well
over 100 years that have since passed extended virtually the entire Bill
of Rights to the States via the 14th Amendment, it has failed to so with
the 2nd Amendment. The decision in Cruikshank that the 14th Amendment
does not extend the 2nd Amendment to the States stands has not only been
made by the Supreme Court, the decision stands to this day.

@_subject: RE: Sci Journals, authors, internet 
Peter has an interesting point, since in addition to common law applies
to a trend in copyright that is prevalent in Europe (and presumably some
other countries), but rather alien to the US, taking that trend further.
For those readers not familiar with this trend, there is the gist of it:
Everybody on this list knows that what buyers of bit strings may or not
do with such bit strings, under pain of incarceration and, should you
resist that effectively, death, is under global attack by the MPAA and
its cohorts.
 What US observers are frequently less aware of is that the same right
is as much under attack, albeit for very different reasons, by the
European cultural elite which has been as effective as the MPAA in
working on their shared goal of dismantling what in the US would be
called the doctrine of first sale. In brief, this doctrine states that
if you buy a book, painting, or DVD, you may read or watch it for as
many times as you please (including not at all), loan it to your
friends, donate it to a library, sell it to somebody else, or chuck it
out with the trash.
The MPAA desires to dismantle the doctrine of first sale for the easily
understandable reason that the MPAA's members would like to approximate
as closely as possible to a state in which each person watching a movie
has to pay the studios each time the DVD is watched. If the technology
existed at a cost acceptable for a consumer device to count the number
of people present in a room watching a particular DVD, the MPAA likely
would lobby Congress to mandate that technology's inclusion to permit
for the collection of per-watcher/watching licensing fees.
The other half of the shears cutting away at the public's right to
entertain themselves with the artwork they purchased in any way they
please is represented by parts of the art culture of significant
political clout, in particular in Europe. Bills are pending or have
already passed, that make it illegal for a buyer of a work of art to
simply dispose of the work, or use it as kindling in his fireplace, once
he no longer desires to own it. No, you can't just burn that painting
you bought from some street corner painter five years ago. Though you
are permitted to give the painting back to the artist. Without
compensation, of course.
Between the corporate objective of charging the readers of a book each
time they read it and the elitist objective of forcing the buyer to read
a book they bought at least on occasion, with both groups united in
their zeal to impose their respective view points onto the public by
force of law and the men with sub-machine guns the law employs, the
future of copyright proves to be interesting. But you already knew that
While the European art circles clamoring for such moral right protection
acts would undoubtedly denounce the assertion that they are working hand
in glove with the MPAA's objective of dismantling the doctrine of first
sale to the detriment of society, the two groups in fact are natural
allies or pawns, depending on their level of awareness of the situation.
Undoubtedly this has not been overlooked by the MPAA, though I suspect
the European artists are blissfully unaware of how they have helped and
continue to help to grease the MPAA's skids.

IPSec is one solution, though I believe an easier way to deal with the

Locate the button in your MUA that's labeled "Use secure connection" or
something to that effect, search the docs for your MTA for the words
"STARTTLS", "relaying", and potentially "SASL", don't use your ISP's
smtp server, encourage those that you are communicating with to do the
same, and the email data retention laws will be of no bother to you.
Anybody that's using postfix as their MTA is welcome to contact me for
more detailed instructions, though the above general instructions will
work for any decent modern MUA/MTA.

The content vendors, which in this case includes the operating system
and application vendors, dislike, but can live with, major criminal
enterprise being the only other party to have unfettered access, since
criminal enterprise is just another competitor in the market place. Most
business models can survive another competitor. Where business models
threaten to collapse is when the marginal cost of an illegal copy goes
to zero and the public at large can obtain your goods without payment. I
don't know if the TCPA's efforts will prevent this, but in the process
of trying to achieve this objective, the average computers users, and
even many advanced computer users, will find themselves in a new
relationship with their PC: that of a pure consumer, with only the
choices available to them the what the 180 TCPA's members digital
signatures permit.
Cloning TPM's is difficult, though not impossible. Note that all TPM's
unique initial internal device keys are signed at time of manufacture by
a derivative of the TCPA master key. Unless you are one of the
well-known chipset or BIOS manufacturers, you can't get your TPM
products signed. It is theoretically possible, though far from easy, to
clone an entire TPM, keys and all.
However, the moment those fake TPM's show up in the market place, their
keys will simply be listed in the next CRL update. And if your OS and
TPM's miss a few CRL updates, your commercial OS and all your
applications will stop working. As might in the future your video card,
your PCI cards, your hard drive, and your peripherals.
You can try to hack around the code in the OS or firmware that performs
the checks, as long as you are willing to operate your machine
permanently off the Net from then on, because your system will fail the
remote integrity checks, but given that this and other security relevant
code inside the OS and applications are 3DES encrypted and are only
decrypted inside the TPM, you can't just read the object code from disk,
but get to first microprobe the decrypted op codes off the bus before
taking a debugger to the code. Not a trivial task at today's PC bus
speeds. Nor can you get too aggressive with the hacks, since your Fritz
may simply flush the keys and leave you with a bunch of 3DES encrypted
op codes and no corresponding decryption keys. Reverse engineering turns
pretty dim at that point.
None of these obstacles are impossible to overcome, but not by Joe
Computer User, not by even the most talented 16-year old hacker, and not
even by many folks in the field. Sure, I know some that could overcome
it, but they may not be willing to do the time for what by then will be

@_subject: Ross's TCPA paper 
I recently had a chance to read Ross Anderson's paper on the activities
of the TCPA at
I must confess that after reading the paper I am quite relieved to
finally have solid confirmation that at least one other person has
realized (outside the authors and proponents of the bill) that the
Hollings bill, while failing to mention TCPA anywhere in the text of the
bill, was written with the specific technology provided by the TCPA in
mind for the purpose of mandating the inclusion of this technology in
all future general-purpose computing platforms, now that the technology
has been tested, is ready to ship, and the BIOS vendors are on side.
Perhaps the Hollings "Consumer Broadband and Digital Television
Promotion Act" bill would be more accurately termed the "TCPA Enablement
Act". BTW, the module that Ross calls a "Fritz" in his paper after the
author of the bill, long had a name: it is called a Trusted Platform
Module (TPM).
Granted, in the context of the TCPA and the Hollings bill, the term
"trusted" is used somewhat differently than the customers of future
motherboards, which are all slated to include a TPM, might expect:
"trusted" here means that the members of the TCPA trust that the TPM
will make it near impossible for the owner of that motherboard to access
supervisor mode on the CPU without their knowledge, they trust that the
TPM will enable them to determine remotely if the customer has a
kernel-level debugger loaded, and they trust that the TPM will prevent a
user from bypassing OS protections by installing custom PCI cards to
read out memory directly via DMA without going through the CPU.
The public and the media now need to somehow, preferably soon, arrive at
the next stage of realization: the involvement in the TCPA by many
companies who's CEO's wrote the widely distributed open letter to the
movie studios, telling the studios, or more precisely -- given that it
was an open letter -- telling the public, that mandating DRM's in
general-purpose computing platforms may not be a good idea, is
indicative of one of two possible scenarios:
1) the CEO's of said computer companies are utterly unaware of a major
strategic initiative their staff has been diligently executing for about
3 years, in the case of the principals in the TCPA, such as Intel,
Compaq, HP, and Microsoft, several years longer.
2) the CEO's wrote this open letter as part of a deliberate "good cop,
bad cop" ploy, feigning opposition to DRM in general computing platforms
to pull the wool over the public's eye for hopefully long enough to
achieve widespread deployment of the mother of all DRM solution in the
market place.
I do not know which of the two potential scenarios holds true. However,
I believe public debate regarding the massive change in the way users
will interact with their future computers due to the efforts of the TCPA
and the Hollings bill would be greatly aided by attempts to establish
which of the two scenarios is the fact the case.

The TCPA specs were carefully designed to permit the user to obtain
multiple certificates from multiple CA's and thus, if, and that's a big
if, the CA's don't collude and furthermore indeed discard the true name
identities of the customer, utilize multiple separate identities for
various online applications. I.e., the user could have one cert for
their True Name, one used to enable Microsoft Office, and one to
authenticate the user to other online services.
It is very much the intent of the TCPA to permit the use of pseudonymous
credentials for many, if not most, applications. Otherwise, the TCPA's
carefully planned attempts at winning over the online liberty groups

Precisely. Nor would worrying make any difference, since all CAs
preinstalled into the browser are equal from a user perspective. The
security  your CA, or VeriSign's CA, or anybody's CA can afford their
customer is subject to an upper bound set by the preinstalled CA with
the laxest certificate issuance standards in existence.
In other words, anybody who selects a public CA on a factor other than
price likely fails to understand the trust models that underlie today's
use of Certificate Authorities.
However, $250k will not nearly get you into the major browsers. Getting
into Netscape is easy. You just hand them the cash and the floppy with
your public key. Getting into MSIE is a lot harder. MSFT has never
charged to include a CA's key in MSIE and MSFT does not intend on
charging in the future. But after the root CA bonanza for MSIE 5, MSFT
instituted policy changes.
To get your CA's key included in MSIE, the CA must have passed an SAS 70
audit. (The CA also must offer its certificates to the public).
The infrastructure, policy, staff, and auditing costs of passing such an
audit will run you upwards of $500k.
By the end of the day, getting a new root into the browsers will cost
you about, give or take a few hundred k, $1M.
Which makes the slightly used nCipher box an even better value. :-)

"Trusted roots" have long been bought and sold on the secondary market

trusted root that comes pre-installed in >95% of all web browsers
In fact, it is considerably more expensive for an aspiring public CA

I would like to again thank the Palladium team, in particular Peter
Biddle, for participating in yesterday's panel at the USENIX Security
conference on Palladium and TCPA.
Unfortunately I do not have the time at the moment to write up the many
valuable and informative points made during the panel discussion. I
will, however, highlight one such issue:
As Peter pointed out, while the Palladium effort was started to meet the
content protection requirements of digital video content providers, he
also pointed out that Microsoft and its Palladium group have so far been
unable to determine a method in which Palladium could be utilized to
assist in the efforts against application software piracy. As Peter
mentioned, the Palladium team on several occasions had to tell the
Microsoft's anti-piracy group that Palladium is unsuitable to assist in
software (as distinct from content) licensing and anti-piracy efforts.
Since Microsoft is not aware of a method to utilize the Palladium
environment in the enforcement of software licenses, Peter argued,
Microsoft does not intend to and will not utilize Palladium to assist in
the enforcement of software licensing.
I, on the other hand, am able to think of several methods in which
Palladium or operating systems built on top of TCPA can be used to
assist in the enforcement of software licenses and the fight against
software piracy. I therefore, over the course of the night, wrote - and
my patent agent filed with the USPTO earlier today - an application for
an US Patent covering numerous methods by which software applications
can be protected against software piracy on a platform offering the
features that are slated to be provided by Palladium.

I have received numerous questions in conversations and interviews over
the last few days as to what I believe Microsoft's response will be to
my recent patent application for methods that utilize Palladium and
operating systems built on top of TCPA to assist in the fight against
software piracy.
Rather than continuing to repeat the same answers in conversations, I
will simply make the answers available to the lists. Obviously, the
following is my personal opinion. I don't profess to speak for
Allow me to first outline some principles of how patents work in the
U.S. Note that I am not a member of the federal Patent Bar and as such
the following is simply my limited understanding of the process and
should not be construed as legal advice.
For a patent to be valid in the U.S., the idea to be patented must offer
utility, be novel, and be non-obvious. I will address the three
requirements as I believe they apply to my patent application in turn:
Utility: According to the Business Software Alliance's website, in the
financial loss to U.S. society due to software piracy in the year 2000
alone amounted to a staggering USD 7.2 billion. I therefore don't
believe it can be reasonably argued that methods that may help reduce
the level of software piracy lack utility. In particular, I don't
anticipate Microsoft to argue that protections against software piracy
that assist in the enforcement of licensing agreements lack utility.

Manager for Palladium, very publicly and unambiguously stated during

methods by which Palladium could assist in the fight against software

he knew of a way to utilize Palladium to assist in the enforcement of

I briefly mentioned to both one of the methods in which I believe
Palladium can be used to assist in the fight against software piracy).
Peter, who obviously would have been aware of all such methods were they
known to the Palladium team, struck me as a forthcoming guy. While I
will readily admit that the impression I gained of the person over the
two hours I interacted with Peter may carry little weight with those
that consider the words Microsoft and honesty to be mutually exclusive,
I would like to point out the following:
If Microsoft, after so publicly denying any knowledge of ways to use
Palladium to assist in the enforcement of application software licenses
to an audience representing a veritable who's who of computer security
and related public policy (the attendees ranged from Whit Diffie to Pam
Samuelson), were to - after my filing for a patent - suddenly assert
prior art, neither the attendees, nor the press, nor the public would
take kindly to having been so deliberately misled by Microsoft.
The likely result would be that Palladium will lose what limited support
the initiative may have at this time. I suspect that even somebody that
may have a low opinion of Microsoft will agree that Microsoft is not as
stupid as to play such a dangerous and losing game.
I was asked the next day at USENIX if Microsoft could not simply claim
prior art when in fact they had none at the time my invention was made.
I would like to reiterate my points made above and add that such claims
would need to be filed under oath. Whatever one's opinion of Microsoft
may be, I doubt that the salaries paid in Redmond are sufficiently large
to goad a mid-level employee into committing perjury.
Lastly, it does not matter for the above analysis if any supposed prior
art were to  be claimed to be created by Microsoft or third parties. It
is simply inconceivable that the scientific members of the Palladium
team would have been unaware of any such prior art given the their many
years on the project and the thorough research they engaged in as
evidenced by the lengthy DRM OS patent. If prior art existed, the
Palladium team would unquestionably have known about it and thus been

Steven raises an interesting point. Having looked at various STARTTLS
implementations it appears to me that if not the designers of STARTTLS
then at least the authors of STARTTLS-enabled MTAs appeared to have
envisioned the use of STARTTLS primarily to secure and authenticate
email submission, not MTA-to-MTA SMTP transfer.
STARTTLS's ability to encrypt authentication information, in practice
primarily SASL, during mail submission from the MUA to the MTA is
certainly welcome; I myself am making extensive use of it in my SMTP
Mail submission does however not represent the bulk of
STARTTLS-encrypted SMTP traffic on the Internet today. A brief
unscientific look at some maillogs that I performed a few months ago
showed that MTA-to-MTA (for the MTA's in question this equates
site-to-site SMTP traffic) use of STARTTLS is a resounding 3 orders of
magnitude more common than the use of STARTTLS to secure and
authenticate submission from MUAs.
Here is why: once STARTTLS-enabled MTAs reached a certain density, which
appears to have been exceeded on parts of the Internet sometime over the
last year, the ability to support STARTTLS triggers the well-known "fax
effect": the moment you enable STARTTLS in your MTA, connections to
other MTAs will automatically be secured, at worst with opportunistic
encryption. With each MTA supporting STARTTLS added to the Net the
percentage of encrypted SMTP connections increases as the use of
STARTTLS takes place without even the knowledge, much less the elusive
active cooperation, of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of users per
I boldly submit that more email is presently being encrypted on the
Internet every single day using STARTTLS than has ever been secured
using PGP, S/MIME, or other MUA-based encryption methods combined over
the entire history of SMTP.
Case in point: I am one of the heaviest users of PGP that I am aware of.
In addition, I have used PGP for longer than most, going back to my days
as an alpha tester of PGP 2.0. I have used and continue to use S/MIME
extensively. Nonetheless, my primary MTA processes more TLS encrypted
email in under a week than I have ever encrypted using MUA-based systems
in my entire life.
Perhaps a student with access to the logs of a large STARTTLS-capable
university MTA will write a paper containing a quantitative analysis of
today's use of STARTTLS. There is definitely a paper waiting in
analyzing this phenomenon.
It is my hope that the authors of MTAs will integrate the lessons
learned from the de-facto use of STARTTLS to enable additional desirable
STARTTLS-based feature in future releases of their software.

Peter wrote [about the benefits of STARTTLS]:
I must concur with Peter. The overwhelming majority of email recipients
with whom I routinely exchange PGP encrypted email operates their own
MTAs, located within their trust boundaries. Which should come as no
surprise, since those with whom I discuss topics requiring secure
communications tend to be conscious of security and thus like to be able
to control the properties of their MTA and other network services.
I also agree that current MTAs' implementations of STARTTLS are only a
first step. At least in postfix, the only MTA with which I am
sufficiently familiar to form an opinion, it appears impossible to
require that certs presented by trusted parties match a particular hash
while certs presented by untrusted MTAs can present any certificate they
desire to achieve EDH-level security.
I am aware that the certs presented by trusted parties could of course
all be signed by the same CA, but this is an unworkable model in
personal communications. What is required in practice is a list of
trusted MTAs with corresponding hashes implemented at the MTA level.

@_subject: The Case for Banning Reduced Hop Count Implementations 
I have followed various discussions lately about the creation of reduced
hop Tor clients that implement fewer than the three hops considered by
Tor's design. Such clients represent an attack on Tor as a whole.
Indeed, defenses against reduced hop clients leveraging the Tor network
should be built into Tor's design to defend against this attack.
Today and for the foreseeable future, Tor's network latency relates to
the maximum latency that Tor users are willing to accept. As Tor gets
faster, it attracts more users and more traffic, which in turn increases
latency. As the Tor network increases in latency, it loses users for
whom the latency becomes unacceptably high.
Latency in turn relates to the number of hops. The more hops, the higher
the latency. Which not coincidentally is why some with lower anonymity
requirements may prefer fewer hops. Here is the catch: as traffic from
those with lower anonymity and hop requirements increases, it drives the
latency of three hop connections above the latency acceptable for those
seeking higher anonymity. The end state, if lower than three hop
implementations are permitted to use the Tor network, is that Tor's
network performance will acceptable only to users of lower hop clients.
This fact alone drives a need to block reduced hop clients from the
network. But it gets worse.
Many of those that would be satisfied with fewer hops engage in
comparatively low risk behavior (which is why they are satisfied with
lower anonymity), such as downloading large files of questionable
origin. The protocols commonly used for such downloads can accept higher
latency than the interactive protocols needed by the part of the user
population seeking higher anonymity levels. Pushing the latency of three
hop clients farther out of the usability envelope.
Though the above is more than sufficient cause to block reduced hop
clients from corrupting the Tor network, it deserves mention that single
hop clients in particular remove the protection that Tor's design until
now afforded to exit node operators. If only three hop clients can use
the Tor network, the Tor exit node operator can be confident that
capture of an exit hop's connection log will fail to provide the
attacker with useful tracking information. This discourages both legal
and illegal attacks on Tor exit hops and thus increases the overall
number and capacity of Tor exits.
Removing this protection will lead to an increase in attacks on exit
hops, which in turn will lead to decreased exit capacity. Further
negatively impacting Tor network latency.
In summary, reduced hop clients are deleterious to Tor a whole and users
with the level of anonymity that Tor was design to provide in
particular. Users with lower anonymity needs should be guided towards
the many other systems available today that provide lower anonymity than
Most importantly, Tor should implement a (potentially blinded) hop
verification that ensures that lower hop count clients cannot abuse the
Tor network.

There are no low-latency anonymizing system designs known to science
today that can protect a user's privacy against a determined, global,
TLA-level adversary. Considerable and by no means unreasonable doubt
exist in the community if such a design is even theoretically possible,
a question for which I refrain from forming an opinion solely due to the
impressive progress science has made over the millennia.
The picture is less clear when it comes to high-latency systems, such as
anonymous remailers. No rational doubt exists in the community that the
systems so far fielded fail to protect against this treat model. But the
question if we know how to design a high-latency system that defends
against the proposed threat model largely remains unanswered. This is in
part due to the fact that the bulk of recent research has focused
primarily on low-latency systems.
That said, it is my belief that if a low-latency system protecting
privacy in the face of TLA-level actors were to be identified, I suspect
the design will be based on PIR, not MIX. It is for this reason that I
encourage high-latency anonymity researchers to focus on PIR designs.
