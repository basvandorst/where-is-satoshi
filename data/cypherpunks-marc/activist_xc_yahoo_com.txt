@_subject: Tell Mr. Kerry if he should call for a recount in Ohio along with the Greens/Libertarians 
Some say it is not enough for him to play bystander while the third parties fight for our rights, that as the only one with 'standing" he must himself demand an immediate recount to keep the clock in Ohio from running out.  Here is a one click page where you can send your personal message to the Kerry campaign, the DNC and the GAO all at the same time.
And if you have an issue of your own you would like featured on The People's Email Network as a decision page, please email your request and we will set one up for you for no charge.  Just show that you have constituency who will participate on the site.
Please post this link everywhere you can to everyone you know.  Otherwise just email back to get off list.
NEVER SEND SPAM. IT IS BAD.
