You need an SSH2 private key(for historical and technical reasons,
ssh2's default key algorithm is not compatible with ssh1's).  Find the
directory containing your sshd_config (/etc/ssh on redhat, /usr/local/etc on
a standard ./configure; make; make install), and run the following command
in that directory as root:
    ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ssh_host_dsa_key
    Now start SSHD; it'll work fine.

Mr. Lindstrom,
I am trying to upgrade from ssh1 to ssh2.  I am getting the following error
when I start sshd:
Disabling protocol version 2. Could not load host key
SSHD does start, however, ssh1 is functional, but ssh2 is not.
Please advise,

No, it can't.  That's the point; it's not like the code running inside the sandbox becomes magically exploitproof...it just becomes totally opaque to any external auditor.  A black hat takes an exploit, encrypts it to the public key exported by the TCPA-compliant environment (think about a worm that encrypts itself to each cached public key) and sends the newly unauditable structure out.  Sure, the worm can only manipulate data inside the sandbox, but when the whole *idea* is to put everything valuable inside these safe sandboxes, that's not exactly comforting.

TCPA eliminates external checks and balances, such as antivirus.  As the user, I'm not trusted to audit operations within a TCPA-established sandbox.  Antivirus is essentially a user system auditing tool, and TCPA-based systems have these big black boxes AV isn't allowed to analyze.
Imagine a sandbox that parses input code signed to an API-derivable public key.  Imagine an exploit encrypted to that.  Can AV decrypt the payload and prevent execution?  No, of course not.  Only the TCPA sandbox can.  But since AV can't get inside of the TCPA sandbox, whatever content is "protected" in there is quite conspicuously unprotected.
It's a little like having a serial killer in San Quentin.  You feel really safe until you realize...uh, he's your cellmate.
I don't know how clear I can say this, your threat model is broken, and the bad guys can't stop laughing about it.
I do a fair number of conferences with exploit authors every few months, and I can tell you, much worse.  "Licking chops" is an accurate assessment.
Honestly, it's a little like HID's "radio barcode number" concept of RFID.  Everyone expects it to get everywhere, then get exploited mercilessly, then get ripped off the market quite painfully.

Uh, you *really* have no idea how much the black hat community is looking forward to TCPA.  For example, Office is going to have core components running inside a protected environment totally immune to antivirus.  Since these components are going to be managing cryptographic operations, the "well defined API" exposed from within the sandbox will have arbitrary content going in, and opaque content coming out.  Malware goes in (there's not a executable environment created that can't be exploited), sets up shop, has no need to be stealthy due to the complete blockage of AV monitors and cleaners, and does what it wants to the plaintext and ciphertext (alters content, changes keys) before emitting it back out the opaque outbound interface.
So, no FUD, you lose :)

This passed by without too many people noticing:
The SEC also asserts that the company's 10-Q bore an unauthorized electronic signature of Guccione -- who was Penthouse's principal executive officer and principal financial officer at the time. The signature indicated that Guccione had reviewed and signed the filing and the accompanying Sarbanes-Oxley certification. This representation was false, the SEC stated in its complaint.
"You got your SOX in my Digital Signature Repudiation!"

There are tens of thousands of places inside a vehicle that a VIN# can
be stashed.  Sometimes you don't always want the attacker to know where
the marks are.
The point is that the thief should think anything expensive is
protected, by which I mean it's too traceable to fence.  At least right
now, this is working.  Hard to argue with success.

Why would it matter?
We leave fingerprints on everything we touch, but generally only LEO's
have access to the fingerprint DB's that can route back to identity.
I don't really understand the complaints here.  Is there something wrong
with luggage tags?  How 'bout writing your name in the corner of a
textbook?  Degenericizing property is sort of an inherent part of owning
it; note for instance that few homes are purchased fully furnished. Really the only concern I have is the effects on the Right of First
Sale, i.e. the ability as a purchaser to sell what you bought to someone
else.  Since "I bought it second hand" and "I stole it and sprayed my
own tagents on it" are similar across so many dimensions, I can imagine
EBay UK eventually having to deal with this head on.

There is no actual description publically available (there are three
completely different protocols described in the press).  I talked to the
author about this; he sent me a fourth, somewhat reasonable document. At *best*, this is something akin to SRP with the server constantly
proving its true nature with every character (yes, shoulder surfers get
to attack keys one at a time).  It could get pretty bad though, so
rather than support it or bash it, I'd just reserve judgement until it's
publically documented at Financial Crypto.
