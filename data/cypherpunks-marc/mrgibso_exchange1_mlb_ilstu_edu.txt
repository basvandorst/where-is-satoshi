Please don't look at it.  If you comprehend the code that you view and
totally rewrite code or create code that is even the slighted bit related,
it is illegal code.  Microsoft will say that the code was no longer reversed
engineered.  As long as ReactOS stays reverse-egineered MS can not touch the
project. On Behalf Of Robert Köpferl

I just read in a discussion on heise
that w2k source has been leaked. So I don't beleve it, but let's see.
Or better not see. What would be the implications for ROS?

It would destroy the project if the code were to make it into ReactOS.
Even If one developer looked at the code it would tarnish the project.
So don't. If you do, take it to your grave and never admit it.
