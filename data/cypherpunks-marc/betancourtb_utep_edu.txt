@_subject: Error 
I was wondering if anyone could help me with this error.  I have no idea what it means.
_XSERVTransSocketINETCreateListener: ...SocketCreateListener() failed
_XSERVTransMakeAllCOTSServerListeners: server already running
Fatal server error:
Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running
Thank you,
