My two cents.
I use a VPN then Tor. If I'm not wrong, my ISP sees that I've connected to the VPN IP. The Tor entry node sees that I've arrived from the VPN This is beneficial if you don't want your ISP to know that you are a Tor user. I suspect that a VPN is less "suspicious" than Tor.
You can buy the VPN service with Bitcoin for added anonymity. Also, check to see whether the VPN leaks your DNS at  or equivalent.
I have checked in Wireshark what happens when I use a VPN and Tor.
The tun0 (the VPN using OpenVPN) interface shows my VPN IP contacting the Tor entry node. I check this using It is of note that tun0 will also show traffic from the VPN IP to other non-Tor IPs. You can look up what these IPs are in WHOIS. I guess this is just other traffic from me (via my VPN IP) to the internet.
The wlan0 shows my internal IP (192.168.x.x) to the VPN IP.
I know this thread closed about a week ago but if anyone has any comments on my post then please reply.
