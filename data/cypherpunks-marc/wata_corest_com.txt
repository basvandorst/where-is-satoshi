@_subject: Re: Proving security protocols 
there are several soures to investigate. a nice survey "varieties of secure distributed computing" by matt franklin
and moti yung introduces lots of protocos with proofs of
security for most. the survey is available on the net, and includes a huge bibliography list form where you can carry on.
Other names i'd mention are andrew yao, martin abadi, joan
feigenbaum, don beaver, phil rogaway , silvio micali, isai kushilevitz, shafi goldwasser, claude crepeau, michel luby, and oded goldreich. ah, i'm forgeting joe kilian. their work shares light in the direction you seek, but i have seen no comprehensive work on the literature.
