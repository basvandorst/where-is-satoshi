Well, there was also some other details left out by that article. A "100kW beam" doesn't tell you very much if you don't know the beam diameter. A 1310nm telecom laser can cause serious eye damage with 10mW, but that's 10mW into, say 38 um^2. But it ain't going to do nothing to enemy aircraft located at a distance. A 100kW laser might easily have a smaller energy density depending on the diameter. In addition, there's the problem of focusing that thing through turbulence, but turbulence through certain wavelength windows may not be a problem.

Well,I disagree about psuedo random number generation, sort of.
First, if I have PSR sequence of the known variety (ie, ANSI or ITU), and if it's mapped to some telecom standard (DS-1/3, OC-3/12/48/192), then my test set can and should be able to lock onto that sequence. This is true whether that telecom signal is raw PRBS, or if it has been mapped into the payload (you use different test sets).
In addition, PRBS have a very distinctive trace signature in the frequency domain. SO if I run my PRBS-mapped telecom signal into an O/E (if it's optical, for instance), and then into an Electrical Signal Analyzer, I'll be able to see if the characteristic Electrical Frequency spectrum matches that expected for, say PRBS-23.If it doesn't, I know something's up. If it does, it CAN of course be something else, but that signal does have the right amount of entropy.
With encrypted info who knows? I would think that testing if there's monkey business might boil down to algorithms--ie, if certain bit patterns happen too often, then something's wrong...

There's "belief", and then there's "faith". With belief,the believer refuses to acknowledge and accpet facts that disagree with their (narrow) worldview. I can't help but put the "Creationists" in this category. (Even a cursory look at their "science" makes it clear that there's TONS of information they ignored or explain away with absurd notions.)
Faith is a different matter. With faith, the faithful see the "facts" (as they are commonly understood) and still find a way to believe in something unseen. Belief contradicts reason, faith operates in parallel. I would argue that great scientists operated with a decent amount of the latter, and Galileo is a good example. At the time, the geocentric theory was still able to predict most celestial events better than a heliocentric one. But Galileo had a deeper intuitive sense that something was "wrong" with that geocentric theory, and its clumsy and mind-boggling complexity.
Likewise, every now and then one encounters religious people who recognize the "unreasonabilty" of what they believe. (Indeed, it's not easy to believe in a God that allows, for instance, the Holocaust to occur). I find these people very different from the "believer" category, and would place folks like Michelangelo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, Kierkegaard, Galileo, St John of the Cross (a Spanish mystic tortured by the inquisition) and many others in this category.
As for being akin to Schizophrenia, I'd point out that Schizophrenia is not a "mental" disorder per se, but a genetically triggered even that causes a measurable, physical degradation in the brain (a Schizophrenic's brain can be identified in autopsies).

The answer is no.
All Eve can tell is the FW1 sent FW2 a packet of a certain size.
The protocol of the encapsulated IP packet, it's true source
behind FW1, it's true destination behind FW2, and the true
destination port are all hidden."
Yes, this was indeed the gist of my question. I was aware that there are actually hard and soft switches that are aware all the way up to the application layer, apparently (I also know that some softswiches have actually been deployed in RBOC/Baby Bell territory.)
But from your previous email, you indicated that the secure IPSEC tunnel is created by taking the packets, encrypting S/A, D/A, payload and protocol fields (ie, pretty much everything) and then dumping them into the payload of another packet, and setting the Protocol field of the parent-packet to "IPSEC". All that is now visible are the firewall addresses.
That's a lot, methinks! In other words, there's practically a bright red flag sticking up saying "I'm encrypted! Look over here!"...it's child's play (well, if you consider making an ASIC child's play!) to then look at the S/A and D/a to see if they are interesting. If they belong to the IP spaces of two large companies, for instance, then look elsewhere (though I hear rumors that the NSAs of the world are branching out into industrial eavesdropping for their parent companies, ehr, for their parent countries).
If a secure VPN tunnel forms between al-Jazeera's firewall and, say, some ISP near Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn (heavy Arab community), then all sorts of spyglasses could pop up.
Thus, I suspect a lot can be gleaned (and is) from communiques without actually de-encrypting...the philosohpy probably is, "why violate civil rights unless we really, really have to? Extract as much as we can without actually de-encrypting, and if the probably of something being "interesting" is high enough, then we'll send it downstairs to be opened" (and even then, determining how hard it is to open the communique might also be of interest...is it legal to open somebody else's email but not read it?)

Well, the rason d'etre of 'eJazeera' as I see it is primarily for publically-taken photos and videos to be quickly "gypsied" away from their port of origination (ie, the camera that took them), so that they can eventually make it into a public place on ye old 'Net. The enabling technology as I see it here is802.11b, Wi-Fi. A typical scenario is the case of public demonstrations where the local "authorities" are called in, and where they get, shall we say, a little overzealous. In many such cases (here, New York City, Here, USA, and there--China, etc...), such authorities will attempt to confiscate devices that could have captured the events or captured the perpetrators (and their badge numbers, if applicable) in photo or video.
The ultimate aim of eJazeera is to make even the thought of "capturing" such video non-existent, due to the commonplace practices outlined in an eJazeera-type document (or eventually tribal knowledge). Short of that, it is of course in itself desirable for such events to get onto the public The methods can be various, but the easiest one was (I think) described by Tim May. Bob and Alice are pre-known to each other. Bob holds a camera, Alice has a Wi-Fi enabled laptop operational in her knapsack. After Bob takes the photos/video, he transfers the images to ALice, who walks off and moves the data to a secure and public site.
Other methods seek to eliminate the need for various levels of pre-knowledge between Bob and Alice, and to also stave off the "round up" scenario where a large group is examined and cleansed of all electronica, before data can make it onto the public net. (Less likely in US now, but easily possible ALso to be addressed in the document are (possibly) suggested technologies, down to the actual gadgets and manufacturers, and recommended spacial resolutions vs distances in order to record, say, badge numbers and facial features. Also, powering requirements won't hurt, as well as suggested methods for mitigating power issues.
(Hey--this might be way beyond what's needed or desirable, butI still think like an engineer).
In a reasonably just world, such images might be used in he short run to prosecute those that overstepped their legal bounds. Inthe long run, the commonplace practice of uploading such images should act as a deterrent to such overzealousness.
As it turns out, however, those POWs being transported were photographed in such a way as to not need something like eJazeera (unless the scope as I imagine it is broadened...is it worthwhile to consider the robust creation of image links etc... on the 'Net?).

Here's something I've been thinking about for various reasons. I'm assuming this doesn't exist yet, but it's such an interesting idea I'm tempted to brush the dust off my C programming books...
Here's what I 'want':
Let's say I've been coerced into revealing the private key to a certain encrypted message. And now, of course, the authorities use that key and open the message, and see the contents (let's assume they are picture of a demonstration or whatever).
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE...If the original encrypted message actually had TWO messages inside it, both very similar. In this example, one of the messages is the "incriminating" pictures of the demonstration, the other is pictures of Pam Anderson or whatever.
AND, this double message has two private keys associated with it: one corresponds to the Pam Anderson photos, the other corresponds to the Demonstration photos. When coerced, I give up the key that opens the Pam Anderson photos (while hopefully annhilating the Incriminating photos).
Of course, there's no way the authorities know that there was another message (not if done very cleverly...Pam Anderson photos might be a little obvious) that they destroyed when they used the fake Private Key.
Does this exist? Would it be difficult?

I too admit of having done some imbibing (Belgian ale I'm afraid).
I was thinking about this on the heels of your last lubricated missive, and a very similar thing occurred to me.
Actually, something far less ambitious (in the short run)...
First of all, I see no deep reason why some bank acount (or, more likely, a whole bunch of 'em) can't be auto-administered like a simple mini bank. It would be auto-administered via the votes of its "owners", who have never met, and who are unaware of the real names of the other owners. Owners vote to lend money out of this account to whomever.
As for the administration, well that's 'obviously' handled by a proxy program somewhere, that translates the votes into actual decisions about the account (including loan amount, interest rate, debt-to-liquidity ratio and so on).
Needless to say, since this account is tied to one or more denominations, it could eventually be shutdown through the concerted actions of various governments. But the mechanisms of such a "bank" are (I think) independent of the possibility of reliability of a future digital currency. (And of course, there's a lot such a "bank" could do before getting shut down.)
The tough thing (or perhaps not..someone here must surely know) is the possibility of lending money to persons who are unidentified in "meatspace". (But then again, even in the non-Cyber world, 'meatspace' is very rarely an issue when lending money...it all boils down to credit records anyway...)

Here we come down to what appears to be at the heart of the confusion as far as I see it. "True", depending on who's saying it (even in a discussion of Godelian Completeness), may be different. Mathematical types may define "true" as being "provably true", meaning something like "this statement can be derived from the other statements in my system by building up from logic plus the fundamental axioms".
In Godel, in any formal system there are statements that are true but unprovable in that system. This would seem to render the notion of "true" above meaningless. But what it means in a "practical" sense is that there may be truisms (such as, "there exists  no solution to the problem of a^n + b^n = c^n, where a,b,c and n are integers and n>2"), which are true (and let's face it, this statement is either true or false) but which can not be proven given the fundamental axioms of the system. Thus, in order to build more mathematics with this "truth", it must be incoroprated as an axiom. (Godel also says that after this "incoporation" is done, there will now be new unprovable statements.)
I originally mentioned Godel in the context of the notion of the dificulty of factoring large numbers. My point was that its possible that...

From the Lightreading newswire feed...
Any comments? Impact statement anyone?
SOMERSET, N.J. -- More than 75 percent of survey respondents believe that browser-based SSL (secure sockets layer) VPN (virtual private network) technology is somewhat to highly likely to replace IPSec-based VPNs for remote access to enterprise resources over the next two years, according to the latest survey on enterprise network security trends from The Tolly Group, a premier IT testing and consulting firm. Netilla® Networks, Inc., a leading provider of SSL VPN solutions for secure Web-based access to any corporate application, co-sponsored the survey along with Check Point Software, Nortel Networks, Ingrian Networks and Enterasys Networks.
Survey respondents also projected that the most likely future uses for SSL VPNs will be for securing Web services (67 percent), followed by securing extranets and e-business services (54 percent), providing remote access for business partners (50 percent) and enabling remote access by mobile and teleworking employees (48 percent).
SSL-based VPN appliances use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption engineered into todays Web browsers to provide simple, browser-based remote access to centrally hosted corporate applications. Unlike traditional remote access solutions based on the IPSec standard, SSL-based VPNs do not require application or VPN client software to be configured and maintained on remote PCs, which reduces IT support costs while increasing usability.
Overall, respondents demonstrated a significant surge in the usage of SSL-based VPNs, said Kevin Tolly, president and chief executive officer of The Tolly Group. Just two years ago, SSL VPNs were nowhere on the map, but now interest in the technology is starting to mature. However, these same users also cited a lack of general understanding on how to deploy SSL VPNs as a potential roadblock. Vendors must step up SSL education to help users better understand the benefits of this technology.

Well, there's some truth here but a lot of oversimplification as well.
I'd argue that the US patent system (or at least the thoughtof it) had a lot to do with the ability of inventors to take risks, gather startup capital, and get a product rolling. There is first of all the perception that their "secret sauce" is to some extent protected (as are the time & $ investments), as well as the actual protection (litigation actually works once in a while, and the threat thereof has kept some from copying to soon and too closely). This environment has had a major effect on technological That's not to say it can't happen in other environments, but it seems to unfold very differently in, say, China or the USSR (which actually has contributed lots of technological and scientific ideas to the world). But none of them have benefited $$$-wise (nor has the pace been nearly as fast) as in the US.
Meanwhile, regulations and governments can give some industries a head start, particularly if a "jungle" already holds a nice warm niche for the output of those industries. Thus Sematec helped US semiconductors to roar back from the brink of extinction, and the buying up (and subsequent dismantling) of lite rail systems in the LA basin in the 30s and 40s apparently had a major impact on the rollout of vehicles Might we have seen much better public transportation in that area if this capitalist coup-d'etat hadn't occurred? The moon shots did apparently accelerate the development of semiconductors.
(A side note should be made here about the fact that some technologies have a very high activation energy barrier...without a very intensive amount of capital, they can't happen. Indeed, aren't we nearly at that point with sub-0.13um technology? It is possible that further advances just won't be possible without direct or indirect government funding.)
The best technology does not always win. In fact, the concept of "best technology" is kinda shakey most of the time. There are sociological, political, and other factors than can alter the course of things for a That said, the technological "survival of the fittest" notion seems to be a fairly constant undercurrent that re-asserts itself periodically as the various sociological ephemera come and go. Like Kuhn or Popper, these aren't the only drivers, but they are certainly one of the axes.

5) NBC, now out in the cold, assigns said informed journalist to covering Ruwanda or other low-profile stuff, and assures military officials that they'll send someone a little more cooperative next time.

@_subject: Re: Senators from Utah being Southern 
20 years ago, I might have agreed with this assessment. Actually, written in the present tense it is largely true. 3,000 years ago is a different story, however, and modern religionists often forget that. The earliest religious texts (including the Torah) are written in such a 'primitive' time that I don't think any of the modern notions apply. For instance, in the Torah it would seem that there are clearly plenty of other Gods to choose from, but the one the jews were commanded to choose was  (Tetragrammaton). He doesn't even seem to have the qualities of "justice" righteousness, truth, peace, compassion blah blah blah that we are supposed to associate with God today. In fact, the Torah was written in the form of a peace treaty, with the implication that if the jews stopped obeying their end of the bargain, they'd get the CRAP kicked out of them. Period.
Likewise, the Vedas and the earliest portions of the I Ching come from a time that is probably incomprehensible now.
A reference to group theory, eh? Nice. The Jungians of the world might argue otherwise, that religion to some extent codified primitive forms of group theory into symbolism. Certainly, the Dzog Chen tibetan Buddhists did comething very close to this, visualizing n-dimensional arrays of 'dieties' which are considered really focal/fold points of "psychocosmic energy"*.
If you are referring to modern religion in the religious sense, I agree. But I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater...there are some very odd things tucked away into the Torah, for instance, that are arguably worth discovering. But then again, maybe I'm willing to throw the baby out with the bath water...if that water gets pooped up enough, the baby is no longer *: See "Psychocosmic Symbolism of the Buddhist Stupa" by Anagarika Govinda for an excellent discussion of buddhist iconography in the context of an architectural study.

@_subject: Important: P2P+VOIP 
This article appeared in the Lightreading telecom site. Although fairly speculative, the mere implications of VoIP over P2P should be of much interest to Cypherpunks, perhaps the least importance being encryption.
Ever since KaZaA, founder Niklas Zennstrom let it slip in a Boardwatch interview that he was planning to launch a company offering voice services using peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols, Light Reading and Boardwatch have been puzzling over what he meant.
As Zennstrom himself has clammed up, speculation is in order. And our best guess is that he might be onto something REALLY BIG. Think bigger than Google. Think of something equivalent to the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) that would act as a distributed, dynamic, global telephone directory, linking users with whatever IP address their appliance happened to be using at the moment.
This addresses one of the big obstacles in the development of voice over IP (VOIP), and it might also unlock other breakthroughs. For instance, it could speed up the convergence of fixed and mobile telephony -- reckoned by Neil Ransom, CTO of Alcatel SA (NYSE: ALA - message board; Paris: CGEP:PA), to be the next big thing in telecom (look for the coming Light Reading interview).
It would be fairly straightforward to use P2P protocols to create such a distributed, global telephone directory, according to Geoff Bennett, director of Light Reading University, who happens to be moderating a Light Reading Webinar titled "Controlling P2P: Who's Stealing Your Bandwidth?" today, at 2:00 p.m. New York time. (Click here to register for the free, live broadcast.)
With P2P, a user could search a directory using a special browser and then click on the name he or she wanted to call. The client software would send the request to the equivalent of a KaZaA supernode that would search a giant routing table listing users and their current IP addresses, and send back the result to the client so the VOIP call could be set up.
This is pretty much how file sharing works, and file sharing clearly scales to the millions of users that might take advantage of such a system. Zennstrom estimates that 100 million people already use P2P protocols, and the KaZaA browser software has been downloaded a staggering 250 million times -- an order of magnitude more than anything else on CNET's download There are good reasons to believe that a P2P-based phone directory of this sort might work better than the VOIP solutions being cooked up by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
The IETF has various projects in this area, but they're all based on the fundamental philosophy that existing technology -- namely DNS -- should be adapted to deal with new requirements, rather than inventing something new.
But the new requirements in this case include more than just the IETF's Telephone Number Mapping (enum) project.
The IETF has also got to come up with a way of making DNS more dynamic, so that when a user moves from one IP address to another, he or she isn't cut off from the world while the changes propagate through the DNS hierarchy. When Boardwatch changed IP address earlier this year, a lot of readers were cut off for two or three days. Imagine the same thing happening every time someone shifted from a fixed to a mobile appliance!
Then there's the issue of reliability. Concerns are often expressed about the security of DNS -- in particular, its vulnerability to denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. A P2P approach promises to be much more reliable, because it's so distributed and because the protocol has been designed to allow for parts of the network going AWOL unexpectedly.
"Historically, the issue with proprietary solutions has been lack of scaleability, and how robust they are in large networks," Bennett notes. "But P2P apps like KaZaA have shown they can scale and have amazing resilience because they're so distributed. How do you make a DOS attack on something that big?
"The P2P solution will obviously be proprietary, and it's always quicker to get a proprietary solution to market than to wait for consensus in a standards group -- especially about something as institutionalized as DNS."
For more on IETF side of the story, check out the following columns by Geoff Huston, a member of the Internet Architecture Board, the IETF steering body:
Lord of the Numbers
Who are You?
Light Reading is rather hoping that this speculation will encourage Zennstrom to spill the beans on what he's up to. Right now, we think we've only got half the story. The other half concerns SIP -- the Session Initiation Protocol -- seen by some as another catalyst for a VOIP explosion. In the Boardwatch interview Zennstrom slapped down the idea that his project had anything to do with SIP. Which leads us to ask: Why was he so adamant?

I agree with this assessment, but would also suggest that Tim May's old-fogeyism has some validity to it. As far as I'm concerned, the state has successfully bonded with big media to pretty much stifle a lot of critical thinking, particularly about what other Americans believe. We saw it with the war protests--despite the fact that the numbers were larger than during Vietnam, the media was successful in (first of all) convincing Americans that the vast majority of Americans supported the war/troops/president. After that, since most Americans believed the right thing was to support the war (because "everybody else supports it"), they then came to quasi-support it, or at least shut up about it. And still, no Osama, no Saddam, and no WMD, but only "kooks" and "commies" are screaming about it.
Thus, to go back o your point, you're starting off with a small population of dissenters, so that once you pass down through the needs for engineering and math skills, you're left with very little.
On the other hand, the only thing that's stopping me from coding up my "eJector"  is a full time job and trying to live in the little spare time I have. So I guess I'm in the population you describe and will be, as long as I remain employed.

A couple of corrections, then the comment. First is that tubes boost the even order harmonics, making the sound much richer and fuller sounding. Also, the Krell is digital, not tube.
But your point is correct, but also well-known within audiophile circles. In fact, single-end triode style tube amps (which hit the market about 10 years ago) have really rotten measureables, but they have continued to grow in popularity because of the the allegedly "live/lush" sound. (Another odd thing about them is that they have extremely low output powers--12W, 8W and 6W are common!) Everyone knows they are basically nearly random tone-control gizmos, but no one cares at this point.
As for 24/96 (or 24/192), like I said there are real engineering reasons for doing this, but in the end there's not much reason to argue if you haven't heard.

There are engineering reasons for this that I'm willing to discuss, though the discussion will be tedious for engineers, and impossible to understand for non-engineers. Far easier will be for you to go and listen
to a CD player that can upsample standard CD to 24bits/196kHz. The difference is not by any means subtle.
As an audiophile (Krell+Levinson+Thiel gear at home), I definitely don't want to grab an analog signal. Doing that the signal is sure to retain characteristics of the extracting gear. But the vast majority of P2P kids won't care one iota that their file was analog for half a second.

Unlike a vinyl record, the CD grooves don't form a spiral...they are concentric circles. Also, the beginning of the CD is towards the center, the end towards the edge.

No, no you have the whole thing wrong. As May recently stated, "crypto is economics". It's one thing for "them" to set up a camera to look at some Arab guy's computer down on Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn. It's an entirely different thing if, by using a virtual keyboard, "they" have to do the same thing for millions of people.

Well, from what I'm understanding of so-called optical tempest, I'm not sure most of the usual thinking will apply.
First of all, anyone know what the most energetic wavelengths are in the CRT's output? (I have no idea.) Is it in the visible range? It may not be. Thus contrast in the visible range may not equal contrast in the freqency range that 'OT' will be using.
Also, and I'm not sure what this implies yet, but the screen-emitted beam has lowest energy after hitting a letter, which is black. Thus this tempest device must be particularly sensitive to the "white" background in order to makeout the letters as the sweep comes through (and is blocked by the And now that I think of it, I'm still not convinced that this does not amount to specular reflection, even though we are now talking about the "ballistic" beam...remember in order to determine what a letter is detecting a -decrease- in the beam's reflected energy will be the key in reading a Oh wait...the answer to defeating optical tempest is simple: have white letters on a black background.
And after they've caught up with that trick, alternate the background colors at random intervals (white on black, black on white, etc...).

No doubt if this movement gets big enough to basically become a religion (like everything in the US) then this will start to happen.
But fixing the conditions at 3rd world sweatshops will have very little impact to the cost of those goods. What's being discussed are things like ensuring that toxic gasses are not being spewed into the workplace (China), or moving workers towards a living wage (Haiti), or workers actually getting paid for the agreed upon wages (New York City). Right now the issue of 3rd world sweatshops has very little to do with economics per se.
The unfortunate thing, however, may be that international Marxist groups will make addressing these issues a priority (at least in terms of their rhetoric). And even though the Marxists will in the long run probably make conditions even worse, the failure to address these issues now may empower Marxists throughout certain parts of the world. Hell...if I found a local factory was regularly grinding up children in the machinery, I'd probably go and take up arms with them (or pay to have weapons drop-shipped to them).

Yeah, kinda bizarre.
There's also an ambiguity that prevents one from saying Q is associative. Is the table defined for both directions of *?

For most objects x*y will not equal y*x (indeed, one may be undefined as in the case of matrix multiplication). Anyone remember the group theoretic term for these kinds of groups?

Although I appreciate the sentiment, your not really getting this. The timing was such that long-term impact was minimal.

Wall Street is here, for one, and Wall Street these days needs power.
Also, NYC now just assumes that power will be there. In 1975 the riots were fairly interesting...the wrong set of conditions could have made this MUCH more interesting (I was on a plane that landed a few hours after the blackouts began.

Walked by an interesting protest outside the stock exchange last week.
In the "pen" in front were probably no more than 600 people attending a protest against the well-named "Patriot Act", and against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their policies.
WHat was interesting was that, despite the relatively small numbers (I've seen crowds 5 times that size allowed for other stuff), police were not letting anyone into the area without an ID of some kind....I heard them saying there was already "too many people there". (And by "area" I mean from Broadway east, one block north of Wall South, and I don't know where the other borders were...I'd bet someone who knew the area could probably find a route in, but you'd have to get up through those wierd SE streets like "Beaver" and so on.
A form of censorship? Definitely...like I've said...I've seen LOTS more people allowed for other stuff (even Nader). There was plenty of room even in the pen (Broad Street has been closed in front of the stock exchange since 9/11/01...there's a series of barracades.)
Now obviously, the "authorities" would probably claim (if push came to shove) that this particular group posed a greater risk than other groups. (Or in NYC, depending on who was asking, they'd probably cite some specific laws that pointed to their right to 'cap' the event at the levels it was attended at at the time, and deny this group was being given special Anyone see this on the news? I don't remember any major news trucks out there...I wonder if their quote somehow excluded them also, assuming they'd be interested (and they might be, if the numbers were much larger).
So...an interesting strategy:
A big anti-government rally is planned.
Cops show up early and deliberately make large numbers impossible.
News folks (already pre-disposed not to cover such an event) find even more reason not to be interested given the small numbers.
Sheeple continue to watch TV and see no coverage of dissent, and assume there is no dissent. Sheeple, assuming everyone else supports the war, now support the war.

I think that it's becomming clear that in order for Americans to feel safe US troops should morph into an international Police force. Next stop: "The ABCNEWS suitcase containing the uranium was placed in a teak trunk along with other furniture put in a container in Jakarta, Indonesia, a city considered by U.S. authorities to be one of the most active al Qaeda hot spots in the world. The container was shipped to Los Angeles in late July, just one week before the bombing of the Jakarta Marriott Hotel that killed 12 people.
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge has claimed major improvements in port security, in part because of enhanced vigilance overseas. "So that our borders become the last line of defense, not our first line of defense," Ridge said in a speech last week. He said the United States was increasing security "thousands of miles away, long before a container is first loaded on a ship."
But in Jakarta, ABCNEWS producers David Scott and Rhonda Schwartz found that the chest in which they had placed the depleted uranium was never opened or inspected before being sent on to Los Angeles. "

"Tim May is the perfect example why vigilante justice is

and innocent parties get hurt."
Well, on one hand taking justice into one's own hands opens the doors to pretty much anything anybody can think of that ticks them off.
On the other hand, there are clearly times and societies where such an approach is warranted. The usual exmples have already been given. These examples seem to have at their intersection a time where the government (and the powers that be) are themselves immune from legal consequence and above the law, while 'enforcing' laws that are innately evil. Such a society has pretty much boiled down to "might makes right", and such a government is a government in name only.
The question then becomes, when do we know when we've entered such a time? More specifically, have we in the US entered such a time? And if we have not, does it not at least appear that we might, soon? If the answer to either of these questions is yes, then Tim May's suggestion is not a matter of "if", but "when". If the Koran becomes outlawed but a librarian rats on a Muslim trying to access the Koran online, then is this not much different from the Nazi days? Of course, we believe that the librarian is trying to "do the right thing". But do you really think that enthusiastic Hitler followers believed they were evil?
No, Tim May's statement is not scary because he's suggesting anarchy. It's scary because sometime in the near future it may actually be a reasonable response. (Well, I dont agree with the 'killing the kids' thing.) If Mike Hawash can be grabbed off the streets without any acknowledgement by the Feds and then go to prison for NOT fighting against the US (but clearly thinking about it), then we are in deep trouble.

I guess in the end we are responsible for the actions our government takes. And if we remain ignorant and continue to benefit (and do nothing to stop it), then we are responsible, particularly when our military represents an outrageously assymetric invasionary force.
On the "left wing liberal" NPR I heard some army dude interviewed. He openly referred to Iraq's  oil pumping station as "The Crown Jewel", and discussed a military action to capture it in terms of a dollar value--"This was a $6 billion dollar target" or some such thing.
Let's say that 9/11 may have been a terrorist act, but Bush & pals are rendering it an ever purer act of war with each passing day.

Let's say I push out a list I'd like to keep secret to some client machine. The user of that machine must enter some ID or other piece of information. I want the client machine to perform a search of that ID vs the contents of a list (again, resident locally on that machine), but I don't want the user to be able to see the other entries of that list.
Possible? Remember, after the initial push of data out to the client machine, no more messages are exchanged. This means the list must be sent in encrypted form.
When the search is performed, the "stupid" thing to do (I think...someone correct me) is to take the user's ID, encrypt it, and then determine if matches an encypted member of the list (and I don't see encrypted each entry individually as a desirable thing). I am assuming that this allows a savvy user to reverse-engineer the encryption.
Another option is one I don't have the background at this stage to understand. Let's assume the entire list has been encrypted in one shot. Is there some function such that when this encrypted list is convolved with the user ID a "Yes" or "no" can be obtained (indicating presence or absence from the list)?
If the answer is yes, I'd also like to know if knowing this is farily basic to most encryption professionals sphere of knowledge...

My point is and has been "crypto is econnomics" (to paraphrase Tim May during one of his moments of clarity). Better to get 'them' to get a subpeona and make 'em expend the effort (and $$$), just to find out the email's about Pamela Anderson's boobs. Or, better yet, to find out the enduser also encrypted the email (AND it's about Pamela Anderson's boobs).
Even if they dig out the plaintext, let them spend thousands of $$$ while we spend pennies. Eventually you gotta figure that'll eat into the invasionary funds, no? (Or am I being naive?)

Well, I'm dubious. Right now I'm thinking their strategy has been to pull encryption down off of the social radar, and that's worked better than any frontol assault. Also watch carefully for hole-pokers...I'd bet their's also been disinfo campaigns to get the public to think that no crypto is secure (every ask anyone if they believed there was such a thing as effectively 'unbreakable' encryption? Reglar folks always believe SOMEBODY'S got the technology to break what scheme you use, so "why bother").
Let's also remember that 'terrorists' are only terrorists when their guns are small. Once they start winning a few battles they're no longer "terrorists" (eg: Mao and that whole gang).

"But silliness about "if everybody used encryption, then..." is just that, You seem to miss my point here (and in general), and since this is probably the closest area in which we agree, I'd suggest it's worthwhile examining Let's first of all agree that the proliferation of crypto is a good thing. If crypto is rarely used, then MY usage of it is actually almost worse (depending on context) than using it. More than that, increased use of crypto implies increased cost of monitoring. The $$$ nature of the assymmetry is mirrored precisely by the calculational assymetry. Ideally, it seems to me that this should be exploited.
"If only everyone" is I agree largely pointless in and of itself. However, when coupled to some fairly easy and obvious applications of "greed", the potential results are interesting. Want an example?
We now see file trading, messaging, and possibly even IP telephony occuring in P2P networks. Some of the P2Ps will be/are encrypted...a primitive form of "blacknet" you might say. Couple this app with popular notions of "protecting us from the terrorists" and you may have wildfire. That's the goal: wildfire.
You're problem is that you don't realize that crypto is no longer a technological issue now. It's now a social and marketing one. The fact that "Tyler Durden" actually has little of major insight to say completely misses the point. Ideally, "Tyler Durden" is a generic, popular figure that embodies virulent, 'stoopid' popularity. Tyler Durden is not an intellectual: He's basically a dumb punk and a rabblerouser. Ideally, he's every man.  He's everything you've always been afraid of, but he is precisely the one who can set you free.

"Basically they say things like "If you think the government can't break all
the encryption schemes that we have, you're nuts."  This guy was a math too, so he understands the principles of crypto."
Basically, the answer was hinted at by another poster.
For anyone who doesn't trust the government, the point to make is that crypto use is currently a red flag. Last year I went through great pains on this list to point out that right now the gubmint probably doesn't even need to break most encrypted messages in order to know something's up. This is only possible because outside of a coporate context few individuals use If everybody uses encryption, then it matters MUCH less if the government can break any one message. What costs us pennies to encrypt may cost them thousands to break. That's the assymmetry we asyms can exploit. That's where we need to depart from a Tim May lone wolf approach to your friendly, smiling America-loving flag-waving cypherpunks: "If you don't use encryption then you help the terrorists win".
This statement has the added irony of being objectively true, according to more international definitions of 'terrorism'.

One day at the supermarket his cart crashed into mine. It may have been an accident, but I'm not quite sure. But the guy gave me an eye, so he's clearer a threat to me.
So what I did the other day was I broke into the guy's house...it was late and I took him by surpise so when he was coming down the stairs I shot him. His older son came at me with a baseball bat, so I had to shoot him too. When I finally got to the wife the ungrateful bitch started crying and begged me not to kill her..."DAMMIT, I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU YOU STUPID BITCH" I said to her, but she didn't seem to feel any better.
Actually, I'm typing this message from her house, because if I leave the cops'll get me and maybe some more of the guy's relatives will come, and then we'll be right back where we started. I've got no plans to leave here for at least 2 to 3 years. Funny thing is, though, every now and then when I'm coming down the stairs there will be tacks or nails or something at the bottom. I'm starting to get the idea they don't want me here!

"That's what the market can bare, my friend, and then some," he says with a sly grin.

@_subject: Re: Has this photo been de-stegoed? 
Well, that sounds reasonable on the face of it, but there's got to be a lot more discussion before I'm convinced.
Remember that psuedorandom or encrypted data has a certain noise spectrum. This noise spectrum is extremely different based on what PRBS one is using...PRBS 2^23-1 looks completely different from other 'noise' (and remember noise is a relative term).
If you spatially fft a random photo, you'll find that the image detail energy largely occupies certain bands. These are not the bands that stego uses (or so I assume...it really can't be otherwise). The stego-able spectrum will indeed be noise, but this noise will have a certain spectrum.
Stego, done well, will I assume try to mimic this noise, but there may be problems. If the message is encrypted, then merely loading that message into the photo will, I assume, NOT result in a noise spectrum that looks like real noise. So you'll need some kind of chopper or spectrum-spreader I If no chopper's used, however, I'm guessing that stego-ed 'noise' doesn't look like true photo noise. If the photo has been de-stegoed stupidly (ie, by writing a random message in its place), that noise won't look like photo noise. So it seems to me that you'd need a sophisticated agent to make the de-steoed photo look like it never had stego. In other words, if the FBI are your man-in-the-middle, then you'll be able to detect that the photo was de-stegoed. If the NSA is your man-in-the-middle, you might not be able to Any of you TLA lurkers wanna come in on a remailer and set me straight?

If a title sells, they know it. And can order replacements."
Nothing particularly socialist about my original statement. I was trying to point out how the knee-jerk mimicry of top-down structures prevented even big companies from making as much money as they could, by awarding and leveraging local talent and information.  It would be nice to think that part of Border's success is from doing some of this. As for the small, independent bookstores, I personally helped trounce one in particular...the owner was not only a know-it-all DICK he really wasn't a very good businessman. He tried to tell his customers that they should want what he was selling and it didn't work. (Every now and then I'd try to send a customer or two his way to get the kind of books the Central Office wouldn't let us carry, and on several occasions the reply was "No thank you, I'm never shopping THERE again...").
So I'm not advocating 'requiring' big retail companies to get smarter, nor am I advocating non-shopping at the big Borders and Barnes and Nobles. My point was that a lot of corporate cultures blindly mimic hierarchies even when that's not appropriate, because it just about the only social model anyone's ever experienced.
Well, I'm thinking of the Lucents, Nortels and Alcatels of the world. Oh, and all the big old financial houses as well. Those two sectors I can claim some decent familiarity with (I too am a shareholder in various companies). When Lucent bought Chromatis, or when Sandy Weil told Jack Grubman to uppe his rating on AT&T or...well, these major, corporation-shaking decisions were pretty much made in a vacuum of power. There's no way shareholders could give the thumbs-down to those absurd deals, or even (really) chuck out those responsible.
Of course, you'll argue that the shareholders could vote with their feet until something was done, but that's besides the point. The point here is that shareholders, Boardmembers, and upper management alike are so used to an environment where little or no feedback is possible that something like this happens so often. I'm not saying "there should be a law"...it's a cultural thing, and the culture sucks, because we're used to being told what to do by somebody else who's "in charge".
Not so fast my fine, crypto-fascist friend. Let's look at Grubman. At the time Sandy Weil gave him his marching orders he probably had (at least) 10s of millions of dollars-worth of immature Citigroup options.

@_subject: Is Matel Stalinist? 
Well, I wouldn't apply the word "oppressive" across the board to the cultures of big companies, but the fact is that modern American coporate culture more often than not imitates a top-down, 'statist' culture that is so universal we rarely recognize it.
For instance, high-level strategic decisions are made almost entirely in the vacuum of power. And often, that's appropriate. But many times, the actual people who do the work and know the most about the subject are completely out of the loop. Silicon Valley at its best operates in a very different way...companies are far more driven from the product/technology/service perspective, instead of imagining that balance sheets can make a Lucent into a Cisco. (And at its best, if some hot engineers along with a couple of useful management types feel strongly enough about a missed opportunity, they just split off and start doing it.)
But the best of Sillicon Valley is a rare exception. Most of the time "they" make decisions and people who are the technical experts must merely quietly implement those decisions. It's interesting to imagine what would have happened to Lucent if, for instance, the employees could have voted on the acquisition of Chromatis. They would have quickly realized that they were getting a raw $3B deal on a mediocre product, AND that they already had something equivalent ready in-house.
Retail is the absolute worst. FOr whatever reason (and I don't believe it has anything to do with competitiveness), big CD or Book chains never empower or reward employees on their ability to purchase books for their store that sell well. In fact, almost zero real purchasing decisions are done locally.
But nobody seems to notice...we're completely used to being passive cogs in a big, fat machine-state. So in a sense, it's gone way beyond 'repression'...no need for that rat-cage around our heads anymore.

Well, having done some optical signal processing (and getting a patent in that area, come to think of it), I imagined that most photos will naturally have some image noise in certain frequency bands...this noise would not have to have anything to do with your camera or whatever, but is probably a function of what's in the image. For instance, a picture of a naked girl standing in front of drywall probably has very little useful image energy in spatial frequencies represented down at the length of a pixel. In a spatial fft there's probably a lot of low frequency white noise for a while, until you get to the level of the shorter body hairs and whatnot. And then there may be spatial freuency bands between that and her height that are nearly unoccupied with image energy.
information goes. I also imagined that if it were done in a very simple way, the stegoed info will be fairly obvious to someone knowledgeable and looking at the spatial fft of the image. I imagine that it will look obvious because, to an expert, it won't look like the authentic kind of noise expected there. If the information is encrypted, I consider it possible that the noise may even look too "perfect" perhaps.
If that's true, then I suspect it's often possible to determine that a photo's stego has been removed. Or at least, there will be cases where stego removal will be "obvious".
Come to think of it, I bet TLA operatives are given precise instructions about what kinds of photos make for undiscernable stego (I'd bet where the spatial image information is not well-concentrated into "bands"). In other words, a photo with all different-sized objects in it. Perhaps they even travel with some photos for just this purpose.
Hum. I wonder if photos of "clouds" work well for this purpose. That would actually explain something I encountered recently....

That's some interesting thinking there. The interesting thing is that no one might ever even notice the presence of this benevolent worm. It could go pretty much unchecked for a while.
As for Variola's comment, you might be right. I just assumed there's some kind of relationship between LSB and those spatial freuencies wherein image information might be stored. Actually, I would still think there's a relationship, in which case an Echelon-like approach based on ffts and "noise templates" might be going on (hence the usefulness of jamming).
Anyone got a TLA Operative Handbook? ANy mention in there of what kind of photos are best for Stego? How about cloud photos?

Well, again you've WAY oversimplified things.
Indeed, this oversimplification is curiously identical to US foregin policy Ho Chi Min, like Mao, would take guns from anybody in order to get the job done. If that meant wearing a Soviet uniform for 15 minutes, then sobeit. Don't mistake that for Eastern-European-style Soviet block "governments".
Was Ho Chi Min ultimately a dictator? Sure. A Soviet-style dictator? Well, I'd argue only nominally. I'd also argue that our post World War II betrayal of Ho had a lot to do with shoving him into the arms of the Soviets, just like with Mao. (But in neither case did the association stick.) The important notion is that, unlike in Europe, China and Vietnam never had anything resembling a democracy or Parliament or anything like that. They were still largely fuedal, agrarian societies that weren't really in a position to critically evaluate the implications of Soviet-style rulership (and in fact they probably viewed it as being merely a non-Monarchic version of what they'd always done). BUT...the Soviets were providing guns and money and we weren't.
That both countries were really only externally Stalinst for a brief while (ie, a couple of decades) is evidenced by the fact that both economies are as about, in SOME ways, as free-wheeling and as capitalistic as exists these days. Of course, both are still certainly authoritarian and, depending on the subject, oppressive, but this has nothing to do with their politico-economic stance per se, as is now obvious.
In other words, the moral of this story is that you can't merely graft on a western political philosophy--in this case Marxism--to cultures that have unbroken traditions dating back to the stone age. It may look 'Marxist' on the outside, but internally that transplant ain't going to take root.
That US foreign policy in the far east in in Indo-China during most decades of the 20th century was a complete disaster was precisely due to the views you seem to hold. It's why we didn't back Mao when even though it was obvious BILLIONS of dollars were being siphoned away by Soong Tse-Vung and the Chiang regime...it's why we backed Lon Nol to overthrow Sihounouk (bringing in the Khmer rouge), and it's why we didn't back Ho even though he fought with us against the Japanese.
Had we stood back from our prejudices, respected the soverignity of those nations, engaged and offered some guns in order for them to choose their OWN government, I'd bet the era of Soviet-style government in both China and Vietnam would have been much shorter, and in Cambodia it would have CERTAINLY never existed.
In other words, YOU (and people with beliefs just like yours in the US government) are responsible for the spread of communism in the far east. Now you and your friends (including, I suspect, the guy who signs your paycheck) are going to do the same thing in the near east: you're going to force many ostensibly neutral nations into the Fundamentalist Islamic camp, because you just don't get it, and think we have the right to interfere.

There's this guy that lives down the block...I think he may be a Satanist or something, but I'm not quite sure. I know he's into some wierd stuff...I saw his wife with a black eye once, and his kids don't look so happy or healthy.
One day at the supermarket his cart crashed into mine. It may have been an accident, but I'm not quite sure. But the guy gave me an eye, so he's clearer a threat to me.
So what I did the other day was I broke into the guy's house...it was late and I took him by surpise so when he was coming down the stairs I shot him. His older son came at me with a baseball bat, so I had to shoot him too. When I finally got to the wife the ungrateful bitch started crying and begged me not to kill her..."DAMMIT, I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU YOU STUPID BITCH" I said to her, but she didn't seem to feel any better.
Actually, I'm typing this message from her house, because if I leave the cops'll get me and maybe some more of the guy's relatives will come, and then we'll be right back where we started. I've got no plans to leave here for at least 2 to 3 years. Funny thing is, though, every now and then when I'm coming down the stairs there will be tacks or nails or something at the bottom. I'm starting to get the idea they don't want me here!
Sometimes I wonder if I should have done this, but now that I look around this guy's house I can see all sorts of whips and books on Satanism. So it turns out I was right! I guess that means I did the right thing.

@_subject: P2P + Instant Messaging = WASTE 
Here's an article off the Lightreading website. Probably nothing new for this list, but it does bring together a number of interesting ideas. Are we seeing the birth of blacknet here? And now imagining adding telephony to Two of the hottest applications in networking -- peer-to-peer networks and instant messaging -- are being combined in the form of private P2P networks that are taking shape in the more secretive corners of the Internet, industry insiders say.
The most popular software for creating these private networks is WASTE, which enables anyone with a computer and a Net connection to set up a private peer-to-peer network over the Internet.
Between the FBI and the Justice Department and the Record Industry of America Association cracking down on file sharing, it was only a matter of time before users found a more secure, private way to swap software and music, says Brian Bruns, security administrator at SOSDG (Summit Open Source Development Group). The SOSDG hosts one of about 30 different sites where the WASTE software can be downloaded for free.
WASTE differs from P2P networks like Kazaa and Limewire as it creates a closed network for instant messaging and file-sharing with trusted users. The person running the network has to swap a key with potential users before they are allowed on the network. An encryption layer is then set up between two computers using private keys to authenticate the parties. Up to 50 people can be on one network.
There are thousands of copies out there, but theres no way to tell exactly how many people are using it, as its designed to be secure, says Bruns.
WASTE was developed a year ago by developer Justin Frankel, founder of Nullsoft. AOL (NYSE: TWX - message board) acquired Nullsoft for its Winamp MP3 software, and while Frankel was with the company he wrote WASTE. However it was deemed to be an unauthorized project, according to Bruns, and AOL yanked it.
Michael Gartenberg, analyst with Jupiter Research Ltd., says anything believed to encourage illegal file sharing would have a major black mark against it, which is probably why AOL scrapped the project after posting it on a site for one day.
He says the crackdown by the RIAA on illegal file sharing has fueled the distribution of this software. The more consequences there are for actions, the more the activity is driven underground Criminals dont hold public meetings, Gartenberg says.
Its a way to chat without having someone watching you, says Bruns. His open source group took a copy of the entire WASTE site as it was posted on AOL, and stored it away for future use. It has since been distributed widely, including to SourceForge, which has worked on improving the original Gartenberg notes that WASTE is unlikely to reach the lofty heights of fame achieved by Kazaa, which has been downloaded over 200 million times. With WASTE you have to know someone in the network, it closes down the number of people available, he says.
Still, the concept of private or personal P2P networks might still find its way into the mainstream, courtesy of Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT - message board). The software giant is trialing a program called  (nothing to do with the 70s pop divas, it seems), which allows users to create small private networks of up to 10 people to exchange instant messages, animations, pictures and music.
Right now the software is part of Microsofts NetGen division, which aims to develop products aimed at 13- to 24-year-olds, but there are broader implications for this product within the corporate world. Think of workgroups collaborating on documents or powerpoint presentations.
Microsoft had not returned calls for comment by press time.

Here's the question Tyler Durden has for you.
Which is more important...annhiliation of the state, or getting a bunch of list subscribers to agree that annhiation of the state is a good thing?
You yourself have claimed to be something of a "techno determinist". In other words, you've made a good case that Strong crypto will eventually lead to collapse of the state...people's BELIEF about the implications of strong crypto are largely irrelevant.
"Eurotrash", "New York Collectivists" and so on should be given nice, big fat pat on the backs, so long as this will encourage proliferation of strong crypto. Who gives a crap what people BELIEVE?
In fact, I'd argue that, if your beliefs prove to be correct, then "making people see the implications of strong crypto" is ultimately probably a bad thing...not everyone wants to wreck the state. Some people WANT to be able to boss others around (or at least want someone else to be doing this). Hell, probably most human beings in 2003 are in this category.
Me? I like the Protestant reformation analogy: I'm not convinced strong crypto will necessarily lead to destruction of the state, just like the reformation didn't lead to destruction of the Catholic church.

"Put a partition down the middle of a school building. One side is "Blue," the other side is "Red." "
Shit. This sounds a lot like my "school of the future" idea.
Basically, in the inner cities the armories are converted into "schools", with a giant partition in the middle. On one side are self-learning stations and a small number of instructors. Kids can choose to go to this side of the partition whenever they want, or never. (BUT school is mandatory from 12 to 22, and big Soylent Green-type scoops scoop up the students every morning and dump them into the school.)
The other side of the partition is basically a giant gymnasium. Guards with watercannon are stationed in the balcony to break up fights.
At graduation, there's a trap door on the gymnasium side, that opens onto a slide leading directly to Rikers.
In the extended version, the "schools" are located out in a gulag, and students live there from ages 10 to 24. There are two jobs in the schools, one is breaking rocks, which are imported from other schools, the other is making rocks in concrete molds, which are exported.
Classrooms consist of a teacher behind a plexiglass wall, giving lessons over a loudspeaker that's cranked far higher than any kid could scream or yell. Thus, classroom noise is basically eliminated as a practical concern (the teacher might also have access to watercannon behind the plexiglass As for teachers, the source is clear: those that fail to graduate must teach for a period of 10 to 15 years.

"The last refuge of the scoundrel is to dismiss stuff as "secondary and tertiary sources," sort of like the fakers I used to meet in college who nattered on about having learned their physics from Newton's "Principia" instead of from secondary and tertiary sources."
Oh, no...don't try to cram me into that category (or practically any other you can think of, for that matter).
I'm a trained, degreed, published, and multi-patented physicsist. I regard as "Primary Sources" anything published in a fairly accepted journal or conference proceedings (though the latter can be hard to find, depending on the conference)....I might read a good review paper once in a while, but in the journals these are normally invited papers, and written by known people in the field they are summarizing.
My admission of ignorance of that end of Von Neumann is precisely that: admission of ignorance due to not having read much ABOUT him, and having only read his more famous papers.
As for a universal nano generator, that notion has seemed a little too science-fictiony for my tastes, though in the optical world some of my colleagues were developing some fairly amazing optical lab-benches on a chip, but these are more at the micron scale.
You'll pardon my scepticism about a universal generator being a useful notion any time in the near future...the recently defunct Optical Micro Machines (OMM) couldn't even get a micron-scale 3-D optical cross connect to work reliably (nor could anyone else, including Lucent, MEMS-R-US, or hosts of others), so that nano-scale generator is at least decades away, if it will ever be possible.

"If a person thought he was not being paid enough, it was his option to go elsewhere, to start his own business, etc. If a business wanted to raise or lower prices, their option. Customers were free to purchase or not."
This is an idealization, of course, and to the extent that it was true I agree with some of the main conclusions here. Another idealization is that, once in a while, someone will get caught in a downsizing or without a job for a while. Knowing that some small cushion existed allowed those with fairly minimal capital to take the kinds of risks implicit in what you're talking about.
"The meme which Tyler Durden and John Young--not surprising to me that both are Manhattanites, representing the East Coast view of capitalism--are popularizing is the one that says that what made companies successful was *government spending*, not this compact which needed little or no government role, and that this makes government intervention in business justifiable. Even more mendacious is the claim that those who worked hard and risked their capital by investing in companies are profiting at the expense of the "less privileged." "
Well. I wasn't exactly trying to say that. At least, "Intel was successful because the government gave it tax breaks..."...that's what I'm NOT saying. However, add my point above to the notion that the whole American social fabric probably can not be separated into small discete chunks, and you get my point. Or at least, the logic that compels one to conclude that the murder of 40 million African Americans is justifiable should somehow make one take those notions with a grain of salt.
Intel or National Semiconductor doesn't and never did exist in a vacuum. They were started by great engineers and physicsts that were educated in places like Stanford, or that worked in Bell Labs. And this isn't an argument for tax-and-spend 'statism' per se, but simply that there's a social/political/economic environment that can't be diced and sliced. You'd dice and slice an African American population, but then again it's from these inner cities that much of popular American culture has arisen (ie, between pro sports, various forms of music and so on...). Who knows the impact these people have had in terms of providing 'content' for the chips and TV screens and so on.
Am I therefore arguing that this justifies US tax policies? Hell no. I might bother trying if I thought $$$-towards-blacks amounted to anything more than mere mollification and storage. (Hell, my household probably pays more than the whole rest of the Cypherpunks list in annual taxes...including May, I'd No, blacks aren't the enemy. I'm not even convinced that the basic notion of the "state" is the enemy.

"If a person thought he was not being paid enough, it was his option to go elsewhere, to start his own business, etc. If a business wanted to raise or lower prices, their option. Customers were free to purchase or not."
This is an idealization, of course, and to the extent that it was true I agree with some of the main conclusions here. Another idealization is that, once in a while, someone will get caught in a downsizing or without a job for a while. Knowing that some small cushion existed allowed those with fairly minimal capital to take the kinds of risks implicit in what you're talking about.
"The meme which Tyler Durden and John Young--not surprising to me that both are Manhattanites, representing the East Coast view of capitalism--are popularizing is the one that says that what made companies successful was *government spending*, not this compact which needed little or no government role, and that this makes government intervention in business justifiable. Even more mendacious is the claim that those who worked hard and risked their capital by investing in companies are profiting at the expense of the "less privileged." "
Well. I wasn't exactly trying to say that. At least, "Intel was successful because the government gave it tax breaks..."...that's what I'm NOT saying. However, add my point above to the notion that the whole American social fabric probably can not be separated into small discete chunks, and you get my point. Or at least, the logic that compels one to conclude that the murder of 40 million African Americans is justifiable should somehow make one take those notions with a grain of salt.
Intel or National Semiconductor doesn't and never did exist in a vacuum. They were started by great engineers and physicsts that were educated in places like Stanford, or that worked in Bell Labs. And this isn't an argument for tax-and-spend 'statism' per se, but simply that there's a social/political/economic environment that can't be diced and sliced. You'd dice and slice an African American population, but then again it's from these inner cities that much of popular American culture has arisen (ie, between pro sports, various forms of music and so on...). Who knows the impact these people have had in terms of providing 'content' for the chips and TV screens and so on.
Am I therefore arguing that this justifies US tax policies? Hell no. I might bother trying if I thought $$$-towards-blacks amounted to anything more than mere mollification and storage. (Hell, my household probably pays more than the whole rest of the Cypherpunks list in annual taxes...including May, I'd No, blacks aren't the enemy. I'm not even convinced that the basic notion of the "state" is the enemy. But those who currently adminster the state and utilize it for various ends have morphed themselves, and (most likely) the American State into the defacto enemy that billions of people throughout the world are starting to resent. For that reason I'd like to cut out the cancer that eats my hard-earned resources and utlizes them to benefit a preselected PS: Is there any comment that Mr May would like to profer on the issue of having been rejected by some hot black tail back in the day?

If true, this is tragic. You might argue that it's necessary, "good" and inevitable, but it's still tragic. Some of these people will be living lives of very high quality, despite their "need for killing". If you got out more, you might know that.

I actually consider it hard enough to develop true competence in math or science (enough to teach on the HS level), and then even harder developing the skills necessary to communicate the ideas effectively. A math or physics teacher can't be an effective babysitter, pal, AND guidance counselor. Or at least, not in the kinds of quantities liberals imagine the schools should be filled with.
On the other hand, given the current state of world education in math and science, by 9th grade it's not necessarily too late for a kid to turn into a good mathematician (actually, I myself am an example: in 9th grade I was in a lame but famous private school pulling down low Bs and high Cs in math because I was bored. By 12th grade I was in what was and is regarded as THE top-notch school for math and science in the country, pulling down 100 in calculus...but don't get me wrong, I still know the difference between me and true genius in mathematics).
However, the fact is that the school system sucks. It's a joke. Repeat offenders get bounced from school to school, wrecking classes and the environment everywhere they go. Teachers in most states have 25 classroom hours a week, a number matched nowhere in the world (as far as I've ever heard), and THAT'S in addition to homeroom and other duties. The cirriculum is a silly joke, watered down and watered down so that only someone who never shows up couldn't graduate. (And in black schools you'd be suprised how many times I've heard 'these kids can't learn...don't try'.)
So your whole "burnoff of the eaters" theme misses one critical element: direct contact with kids. If you yourself had seen and met kids you KNEW might actually have quite a talent for math, YES EVEN YOU might be tempted to give a crap, and see if just one or two might somehow be inspiried merely to do some homework. This is particularly true when you realize that you actually LIKE some of these kids, which are as fully human as you are, by the way.
Or, it might just make you even angrier...give your rage some real, practical real-world "fuel" rather than being the theoretical cloistered construct it at least appears to be. At least, 'talent' doesn't seem to be the problem. Inner-city black kids have proven that they can do extremely well in whatever they view as important (I'd argue that some of this is due to genetic superiority)...a well-run school system could easily produce the kind of math and engineering talent needed without brain-draining from other countries (and which is probably not a relaible long-term option).
I don't remember reading any von Neumann where he discusses the idea of "general assemblers"....I'm still not convinced the general physics of that idea works out, and I believe Freeman Dyson has had some similar doubts. But despite that there's a point here...
Hell, you don't have to go that far. Food is already cheap enough that we might regard it as being nearly free. I mean, for a couple of bucks you can buy enough beef to stuff a welfare family of five, and to feed a rural Chinese family for a friggin' week. (Well, at least in the US...) People from mainland China would still regard most welfare families as "rich" by Chinese standards.
I've also witnessed this trend, but I currently believe it only holds in certain segments. There are various "craft" industries (as I call them) where this equation seems to be held in suspension. Like it or not, hip hop is one of those, though I suppose you could argue that the number of hip-hop 'artists' that make it is tiny compared to the audience. But the point is that in a craft industry, we're really referring to specific and local tastes, as opposed to Darwinian selection (ie, the 'most fit'). In a craft there may be room for many to contribute.

What's desired in such an envornment is not necessarily the best/fastest/brightest, but something with a particularly 'quality' that corresponds to local vagaries of culture and taste.

This is certainly possible. On the other hand, depending on how technology unfolds we might all of a sudden find ourselves caught short and looking for talent. And certainly, the have-nots will actually have more and more as time goes on, though perhaps not much land or space.

Well I be darned if Mr May hasn't inspired a major burst of eloquence, between this response and Mr Young's.
As for this comment:
"Schools don't educate, but merely serve as a filter for employers to
locate those individuals who aren't going to make trouble at the factory."
At best. In the inner cities the function of schools is strongly hinted at by the following well-used phrase:
"Stay In School!"
In other words, schools keep the crime rates down, as is a well-known statistic. They are basically storage facilities. For real schools we white folks with $$$ can move out to the suburbs or send our kids to private As for,
I basically agree with this, though no doubt there are "Leaders" that play on this (and the latent laziness of all teeneagers) to a tune similar to what May is saying. But in most cases, even "good" schools are a joke, and black folks at least realize this. Did anyone notice that there's only 1 or 2 states in the nation that still require Regents endorsements?
I'll tell you a story.
Back in the late 1980s I taught at a notorious HS in Bedford Stuyvesant. 90% of my students were black. I regarded few of them as stupid, but almost none of them saw the point of studying math...they just didn't see how it could benefit them, and they said this to me on a regular basis.
In one class I had some relatively young and non-troublemaking students. I told them from the beginning that I would not slip the standards so they could pass...they HAD to do homework in order to pass, as that would be the only way they could practice enough for the tests. For the first couple of tests all of the non-immigrant black kids failed. But I hammered them and told them it was going to continue like this unless they did the homework and studied. I made it absolutely clear what I expected from them.
By the end of the semester most of the kids were doing their homework, and passing the quizzes and tests, which I did not make easier in any way. I remember Willie Horne coming in before a test and "complaining" "Mr Durden, I STUDIED last night!". I reached out to feel his forehead and said "Willie? Are you feelin' alright?" Of course, he pulled back and stifled a smile, but he got a 90.

"The last refuge of the scoundrel is to dismiss stuff as "secondary and tertiary sources," sort of like the fakers I used to meet in college who nattered on about having learned their physics from Newton's "Principia" instead of from secondary and tertiary sources."
Oh, no...don't try to cram me into that category (or practically any other you can think of, for that matter).
I'm a trained, degreed, published, and multi-patented physicsist. I regard as "Primary Sources" anything published in a fairly accepted journal or conference proceedings (though the latter can be hard to find, depending on the conference)....I might read a good review paper once in a while, but in the journals these are normally invited papers, and written by known people in the field they are summarizing.
My admission of ignorance of that end of Von Neumann is precisely that: admission of ignorance due to not having read much ABOUT him, and having only read his more famous papers.
As for a universal nano generator, that notion has seemed a little too science-fictiony for my tastes, though in the optical world some of my colleagues were developing some fairly amazing optical lab-benches on a chip, but these are more at the micron scale.
You'll pardon my scepticism about a universal generator being a useful notion any time in the near future...the recently defunct Optical Micro Machines (OMM) couldn't even get a micron-scale 3-D optical cross connect to work reliably (nor could anyone else, including Lucent, MEMS-R-US, or hosts of others), so that nano-scale generator is at least decades away, if it will ever be possible.

It seems to me only reasonable to attempt to make things better, while the inevitable unfolds, if it will.

Instead, to further the anti-state goals, it might actually be far more expedient to encourage said statists in their use and proliferation of strong crypto, thereby speeding the inevitable through the very same vectors that seek to delay it.

Nah nah Variola...I don't think you're getting me here. Or maybe you are...
The problem with inner city school systems where there are large numbers of african american students are, first of all, with notable exceptions (ie, some areas around Atlanta, St Albans Queens, etc...) crime rates are high, and African American students, on average, seem to be 'problems' more than Asians or Jewish kids (certainly), and probably more than whites.
The next problem, and here is where the notion of "storage" comes in, is that administrators in those districts do practically ZERO to keep disruptive, dangerous students out of the classrooms. They also seem to feel that if reasonable standards of behavior were applied throughout these districts, "all the bad kids would end up on the streets", which is true. Meanwhile, good black students must therefore tolerate high numbers of disruptive, dangerous, and armed delinquents in the schools, and so classes begin to turn into baby-sitting sessions.
All of this pretty much comes from tolerating bad behavior, because "they" can't help themselves.
What I'm saying is that, as long as there are public schools (and I still think public schooling could be a good idea, albeit in a highly modified form), they need to be completely color blind in the standards, and damn the consequences to society at large. What they'll find is that a suprising number of African Americans will rise to the challenge, and do as well in college as other ethnic groups.
Now if you're saying that public schools shouldn't even exist...well...OK, whatever. But as long as they DO exist, its best we run them in a way where they are what they are supposed to be. And if they're supposed to be storage facilities, then put gaurds and watercannon into armories and send the Scoops around to collect up the "students" off the streets every morning.

The next problem, and here is where the notion of "storage" comes in, is that administrators in those districts do practically ZERO to keep disruptive, dangerous students out of the classrooms. They also seem to feel that if reasonable standards of behavior were applied throughout these districts, "all the bad kids would end up on the streets", which is true. Meanwhile, good black students must therefore tolerate high numbers of disruptive, dangerous, and armed delinquents in the schools, and so classes begin to turn into baby-sitting sessions.
All of this pretty much comes from tolerating bad behavior, because "they" can't help themselves.
What I'm saying is that, as long as there are public schools (and I still think public schooling could be a good idea, albeit in a highly modified form), they need to be completely color blind in the standards, and damn the consequences to society at large. What they'll find is that a suprising number of African Americans will rise to the challenge, and do as well in college as other ethnic groups.
Now if you're saying that public schools shouldn't even exist...well...OK, whatever. But as long as they DO exist, its best we run them in a way where they are what they are supposed to be. And if they're supposed to be storage facilities, then put gaurds and watercannon into armories and send the Scoops around to collect up the "students" off the streets every morning.

"Put a partition down the middle of a school building. One side is "Blue," the other side is "Red." "
Shit. This sounds a lot like my "school of the future" idea.
Basically, in the inner cities the armories are converted into "schools", with a giant partition in the middle. On one side are self-learning stations and a small number of instructors. Kids can choose to go to this side of the partition whenever they want, or never. (BUT school is mandatory from 12 to 22, and big Soylent Green-type scoops scoop up the students every morning and dump them into the school.)
The other side of the partition is basically a giant gymnasium. Guards with watercannon are stationed in the balcony to break up fights.
At graduation, there's a trap door on the gymnasium side, that opens onto a slide leading directly to Rikers.
In the extended version, the "schools" are located out in a gulag, and students live there from ages 10 to 24. There are two jobs in the schools, one is breaking rocks, which are imported from other schools, the other is making rocks in concrete molds, which are exported.
Classrooms consist of a teacher behind a plexiglass wall, giving lessons over a loudspeaker that's cranked far higher than any kid could scream or yell. Thus, classroom noise is basically eliminated as a practical concern (the teacher might also have access to watercannon behind the plexiglass As for teachers, the source is clear: those that fail to graduate must teach for a period of 10 to 15 years.

Here's the question Tyler Durden has for you.
Which is more important...annhiliation of the state, or getting a bunch of list subscribers to agree that annhiation of the state is a good thing?
You yourself have claimed to be something of a "techno determinist". In other words, you've made a good case that Strong crypto will eventually lead to collapse of the state...people's BELIEF about the implications of strong crypto are largely irrelevant.
"Eurotrash", "New York Collectivists" and so on should be given nice, big fat pat on the backs, so long as this will encourage proliferation of strong crypto. Who gives a crap what people BELIEVE?
In fact, I'd argue that, if your beliefs prove to be correct, then "making people see the implications of strong crypto" is ultimately probably a bad thing...not everyone wants to wreck the state. Some people WANT to be able to boss others around (or at least want someone else to be doing this). Hell, probably most human beings in 2003 are in this category.
Me? I like the Protestant reformation analogy: I'm not convinced strong crypto will necessarily lead to destruction of the state, just like the reformation didn't lead to destruction of the Catholic church.

I'm thinking about a WiFi repeater...
Imagine I work on a high floor in an office tower, but I know that very nearby, on the ground floor, there's a public WiFi hotspot.
Now let's say I want to be able to access that hotspot, but I'm currently out of range due to the height.
DOES THERE EXIST something like a WiFi "repeater", which will allow me to "reach" that public WiFi spot without my being within 200 feet or so? (I deploying one or more repeaters throughout our offices so that I can reach the public hotspot.)
Of course, it's also better if that repeater masks who I am to the real hotspot, and terminates encryption on both sides. But of course, I don't want it to cost a ton, and I probably don't want anyone else to be able to use it either.
One nice application of this is to be able to regularly send messages from this public spot, but without anyone every actually seeing me. And if the "last" repeater is in these (private) offices somewhere, it's doubtful anyone would ever be able to tell that this is occurring.

@_subject: P2P + Instant Messaging = WASTE 
Here's an article off the Lightreading website. Probably nothing new for this list, but it does bring together a number of interesting ideas. Are we seeing the birth of blacknet here? And now imagining adding telephony to Two of the hottest applications in networking -- peer-to-peer networks and instant messaging -- are being combined in the form of private P2P networks that are taking shape in the more secretive corners of the Internet, industry insiders say.
The most popular software for creating these private networks is WASTE, which enables anyone with a computer and a Net connection to set up a private peer-to-peer network over the Internet.
Between the FBI and the Justice Department and the Record Industry of America Association cracking down on file sharing, it was only a matter of time before users found a more secure, private way to swap software and music, says Brian Bruns, security administrator at SOSDG (Summit Open Source Development Group). The SOSDG hosts one of about 30 different sites where the WASTE software can be downloaded for free.
WASTE differs from P2P networks like Kazaa and Limewire as it creates a closed network for instant messaging and file-sharing with trusted users. The person running the network has to swap a key with potential users before they are allowed on the network. An encryption layer is then set up between two computers using private keys to authenticate the parties. Up to 50 people can be on one network.
There are thousands of copies out there, but theres no way to tell exactly how many people are using it, as its designed to be secure, says Bruns.
WASTE was developed a year ago by developer Justin Frankel, founder of Nullsoft. AOL (NYSE: TWX - message board) acquired Nullsoft for its Winamp MP3 software, and while Frankel was with the company he wrote WASTE. However it was deemed to be an unauthorized project, according to Bruns, and AOL yanked it.
Michael Gartenberg, analyst with Jupiter Research Ltd., says anything believed to encourage illegal file sharing would have a major black mark against it, which is probably why AOL scrapped the project after posting it on a site for one day.
He says the crackdown by the RIAA on illegal file sharing has fueled the distribution of this software. The more consequences there are for actions, the more the activity is driven underground Criminals dont hold public meetings, Gartenberg says.
Its a way to chat without having someone watching you, says Bruns. His open source group took a copy of the entire WASTE site as it was posted on AOL, and stored it away for future use. It has since been distributed widely, including to SourceForge, which has worked on improving the original Gartenberg notes that WASTE is unlikely to reach the lofty heights of fame achieved by Kazaa, which has been downloaded over 200 million times. With WASTE you have to know someone in the network, it closes down the number of people available, he says.
Still, the concept of private or personal P2P networks might still find its way into the mainstream, courtesy of Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT - message board). The software giant is trialing a program called  (nothing to do with the 70s pop divas, it seems), which allows users to create small private networks of up to 10 people to exchange instant messages, animations, pictures and music.
Right now the software is part of Microsofts NetGen division, which aims to develop products aimed at 13- to 24-year-olds, but there are broader implications for this product within the corporate world. Think of workgroups collaborating on documents or powerpoint presentations.

It seems odd to me that such a wide variety of political views are all called "left" simply they don't proclaim the US as savior-to-the-world.
Of course, there are those with fairly leftist views in these ranks, but that's not all that relevant. The interesting thing however is that American liberalism is now seen as right-wing (in the pro-US policy sense) by international "leftists" (meaning international dissidents), indicating it's complete and total moral failure.

Uhm. Good point. But I think that the Luxemborg wrinkle was interesting...
The more interesting idea is peer-to-peer VoIP. That plus crypto and I don't think prying ears could do a whole hell of a lot. In fact, the game may be over on some levels...certainly, CALEA seems to have at best a slippery legal hold on VoIP at all, and that's when the VoIP calls are hubbed or "switched" somehow (you packet heads can remove the quote-marks from 'switched'). Peered VoIP seems to push any eavesdropping all the way out to the edges of the network.

If you make a calculation of the number of humans made miserable by greater Christendom (to use a Kierkegaardian term), it probably dwarfs a similar calculation made for other religions, including Stalinism. On the other hand, the Christians learned how to make precise-bore gunpowder weapons earlier than anyone else, so maybe it's just an historic accident.

@_subject: FCC Rules on Internet Telephony 
This came out on lightreading.com. Seems there's one tiny step backward for CALEA w.r.t Internet telephony. I guess it's obvious the FBI will eventually get it's way, but it's be interesting to see how it goes about it from here At its open meeting today, the FCC took a couple of baby steps toward providing regulatory clarity on Internet telephony.
The first big decision was a victory for VOIP proponents. The commission ruled that Pulver.com's Free World Dialup VOIP service is an information service, not a telecommunications service. The decision was based largely on the analysis that it doesn¡¯t fit the 1996 Telecom Act¡¯s definition of a telecommunications service.
¡°There is no question that this doesn¡¯t constitute a telecommunications service,¡± said commissioner Kathleen Abernathy. ¡°It falls squarely outside that statutory definition.¡±
That analysis was shared by commissioner Jonathan Adelstein: ¡°Pulver.com¡¯s service is largely unregulated today and, in my view, should stay that Commissioner Michael Copps dissented amid concerns that the FCC hadn¡¯t fully considered the implications, particularly for law enforcement, universal service, and public safety. ¡°I¡¯m afraid we¡¯re leaping before we¡¯re looking,¡± he said. ¡°This rush to reclassify will lead us down a road where we¡¯re compelled to engage in legal calisthenics and contortion of both CALEA and the 1996 Telecom Act to meet our statutory obligations. This is admittedly an important decision, but not so important that it cannot wait a little while longer while we conduct an expeditious review.¡±
That review is coming. After the vote on Free World Dialup, the commission initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Internet telephony (see  Although the commission is starting from the premise that VOIP should be subject to minimal regulation, it still has to clarify issues such as wiretaps and whether Internet telephony is an intrastate or interstate However, there are two reasons to believe that the FCC won¡¯t issue an Order on VOIP until late 2004 -- if then. First, the commission historically doesn¡¯t undertake major policy initiatives in a Presidential election year. Second, Internet telephony is such a complex issue with such far-reaching implications that it¡¯s difficult to see how it could be resolved to everyone¡¯s satisfaction, let alone in one fell swoop.
One thing is clear: The commission believes that federal regulators, not states, should set VOIP regulations. The NPRM is an opportunity to avoid a patchwork of rules across the country, Abernathy says. Nevertheless, completely preempting state authority likely would send Internet telephony to the courts, prolonging uncertainty.

Ah Variola...do I detect a wee bit of Knee-jerk in your otherwise consistently iconoclastic views? Let's take a looksee...
Think I'm gonna have to disagree with ya' hear partner.
For one, in the old days Corporations regularly hired goons to mow down striking coalminers and whatnot.
OK, those days are all gone, right? Wrong. Halliburton and Bechtel have both hired mercs for their Iraq operations. (In fact, I was on a call a couple of weeks ago where a Halliburton official was describing the casualties they take on a regular basis. These don't get reported much in the news, though, for obvious reason...)
However, a corporation doesn't actually have to hire the goons these days in order to get the job done, not when it's much cheaper to call upon the publically-available pool of goons that function as a government in some places. The fact that some corporations may leverage existing thuggery to get their job done doesn't make them any less complicit. But this is all besides my main point...
Well, this is where I suspect a little knee-jerk. I'm no socialist: in no way am I saying that "Corporations are inherently evil". (In fact, I'm hoping to continue profiting admirably as the result of my participation in the capitalist system.) What I think bares investigation is whether or not, here in the US, a subset of the big corporations are so tied in with the political engine as to be complicit in the violations we both agree are As Max said so eloquently, this is not to imply that "we should make some laws and eliminate these big evil corporations". Or maybe it is (I dunno...I'm a stoopid Cypherpunk...). But I don't think it's inherently inconsistent to point out that there may be a direct correlation between the activities of our particular State and the interests of a subset of Large, Old-money-dominated US Coporations.

Sure, you might be able to make that argument.

The gaseous state is of course where molecules have reached an escape velocity, overcoming the inter-molecular attraction. In the case of a noncrystalline solid (at room temp) it probably makes sense to include transition from the "liquid" state into gaseous as being describable by the word "sublimation". If not, the word is probably not very useful outside of HS and pre-med physics courses.

I guess, "do unto others..." P2P is basically the same...remember, in the simplest versions there was never any need to make content available. However, P2P-ers seemed to innately understand that P2P won't really be possible unless one is a source as well as a sink.

(This actually does make sense because it eats a hell of a lot more battery power transmitting a packet than receiving it.) Second, when the battery is within X minutes of dying then only listening and not transmitting.
But I think my main point holds: even 'reglar' folks will realize that there's a "gobal" benefit to routing someone else's packets, even if that does eat into remaining battery time.

Of course, the router does not see that redundancy and can not make use of it. The multiple links that do exist (each of which protected behind the scenes by the telecom service provider) can be utilized by the router. If one of those links goes down (perhaps it was unprotected "extra traffic" in a BLSR and there was a fiber cut), the router will just send the stuff through the other link.

Well, from the little I can understand of what you're saying, there seems to be some stuff worthy of at least cursory consideration there. However, the analogy to switching systems is a little off.
For one, a telephony switch isn't really something that can be measured on one axis (ie, throughput). There are two (or perhaps 3) axes that really describe the family of telephony switches: throughput and granularity. Back in my telecom days I used to joke that "In my pocket I have a switch matrix capable of 100 Terabits of throughput"...whereupon I'd whip out a (fiber) jumper, and point out that this jumper could "switch" 100Tb "from this port to this port". (This is an exageration of claims made about the throughput of OXCs, or optical cross connects.)
This is important because it is indicative of the fact that there is no hierarchy of switches as you describe in a telephony switch. A Broadband DCS doesn't somehow control the network. In fact, you could argue that the 'little' 5ESS switches out on the edge ultimately control the network, though even that would be inaccurate.
No, the entire phone network is "governed" externally by an OSS. I don't really see how this is describable by a hierarchy per se, and certainly not a hierarchy that can somehow be traced to a linear measure of switching As for the tem "geodesic", I have to admit it's cool sounding in this FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar  get it now!

Someone enlighten me here...I don't see this as obvious. I might certainly be willing to pay to route someone else's message if I understand that to be the real cost of mesh connectivity. In other words, say I'm driving down the FDR receiving telemetry about the road conditions downtown of me by a few miles. If I'm a router, I'm also sending that info behind me (which is routing I'm paying for basically), but I will understand that the reason I am getting my telemetry is precisely because there's a string of "me's" in the cars in front of me, routing info down to me. If I insist on getting paid, so will they, and the whole thing breaks down.
Actually, this reminds me of the prisoner's dilemma. I remember (I think) Hofstaedter doing an interesting analysis that showed that smart 'criminals' will eventually realize that it pays to cooperate, even if that doesn't optimise one's chances in this particular instance.
Of course, the battery lifetime acts as the "weighting" factor here...if only a small % of the traffic I'm routing belongs to me, then I may not be so willing to route it if my battery lifetime is short. As battery time lifetime increases however (though this sorely lags behind Moore's law) then more and more people will be willing to route.

Well, as usual I don't think I'm understanding you here. In my example I'm imagining I'm a livery cab driver or something. In that case, instantaneous micro-traffic-conditions can be very valuable in NYC.
In that environment, a cabbie will quickly understand that the network will collapse if all of the wireless nodes act to conserve power by not re-transmitting information. So even though it costs you something to route a packet you yourself will not use, if you're even reasonably smart you'll pass some on until you're nearing your batteries exhaustion, then perhaps go into a listening mode.
(And of course, it may easily be possible to form spontaneous VLANs that deal only with traffic, and then only route those packets...but that doesn't change my argument any.)

Well, this is not well understood by those outside the credit world.
What the law actually states is (basically) a defaulted loan must be forgiven after seven years. In other words, it is illegal to continue to attempt to collect on a loan, 7 years after the default.
However, it is perfectly legal to remember that an individual failed to pay back a loan. In practice, this means that a large brand-name Credit Card company can choose not to send an offer to someone that defaulted 10 years ago. Of course, they can't dunn that person anymore, but they don't have to offer a card. I know without any doubt that there is at least one that does this, and it's not like the Feds wouldn't notice!

My point was (and sometimes is) that our beliefs about Economics, capitalism, and politics are to some extent irrelevant in the light of a techno-determinist point of view (Riad Wahbi pointed this out a few posts ago). In that context, raising some questions about some of the accepted notions about capitalism wasn't (for me at least) necessarily an attempt to "fight" the crypto-anarchic view/goal/partyline May seemed bent on establishing, but rather to suggest that even groups or individuals with ostenibly very different goals might be able to embrace a crypto-approach towards achieving their aims. In other words, it should be considered a good thing if leftists or liberals or Jihadists utilize well-formed crypto...that can actually only accelerate whatever's down the pike. And opening the discussions up a bit for such not only keeps away the philosophical inbreeding of some lists, it might actually start something amongst adherents of that point of view.
And hell, if there's a way to maintain a left-wing stance without that eventually resulting in me having to put in 14 hour days in People's Shoe Factory Number 14, then more power to 'em....I think it's probably too late even for some 21st Century hyper-Stalin to sieze control of both wireline and wireless internet now... but again, who gives a crap.

"When faced with force, you reply with force when you can."
Nah. This isn't even true in a fistfight, except when the guy you're fighting is a) significantly smaller than you, and b) less trained. More often than not, if someone attacks you, it's because they either have or perceive themselves to have an overwhelmingly superior force. In such a situation it's often best to run. Barring that, then "soft" methods are by far the best alternative, but soft methods normally require intelligence, or at least the ability to utilize an opponent's force against him (I think I can unequivocally state that I have had the opportunity to test such a principal here on the streets of NYC). And of course, if it's possible to diarm your opponent without actually killing or maiming him, that's sometimes far more appropriate...reference 'Aikido' and remember the unmasked "MasterBlaster". Every once in a while, somebody makes a mistake they eventually regret.

Storage wasn't my point per se. My point was that quantum cryptography only becomes unsnoopable* when it's in the optical form. With current optical fiber technologies this would limit the useful bandwidth distance product to short distances (ie, 10s of Km for key exchanges). After that, the signal must go O/E and then it's just the same as any normal digital signal.
Where Quantum Crypto might have application is in small metro area deployments, like downtown NYC or the DC Beltway, and where people are completely totally balls-to-the-wall paranoid about security (ie, they assume an attacker is willing to tap into their fiber and has all of the test sets needed to pull out a useful packet exchange--that ain't no pimply-face DoS script bunny, and hell it ain't Al Qaeda either).
Of course, to extend quantum protection beyond mere transport you'd need all sorts of quantum logic gates and processors (in addition to storage), but don't look for that in our lifetimes.

Beaming isn't something magic, it's a medium for programs to send bits

If your would-be victim's Palm is asleep, it's not listening for IR."
Well, some of your other answers are good enough that I suspect I don't understand you.
The IR port on a palm is, I assume, a combination IR diode and some sort of receiver. When the IR port is ready to receive a beam, clearly there's a DC bias that goes up across the receive circuitry to allow it to receive and amplify the signal. The questions here are: 1) Does this bias go away when the non-sleeping Palm is not ready to receive a beam? 2) When the unit is off, does the bias go fully to zero, or is there some leakage bias?
If there's any kind of leakage bias, then a high-powered signal might get a few bits through. After that, only a Palm OS expert will know if there's some kind of signal that can tease the Palm awake and then get it to swallow some kind of trojan.
Frankly, however, I consider this unlikely, but I am unfamiliar enough with Palm OS as to consider it within the realm of possibility.

Well, what I think they do is ostensibly ACH some funds over, which ostensibly hit your account. Because you "see" these funds in your account, you feel pretty hunky dory and pay the dude his little fee (of several thou). Meanwhile, a couple of things occur. One thing that seems to happen is that, eventually, the banks realize there are insufficient funds in the account to cover the ACH. Or else the ACH is reversed.
What I can't quite figure out is how they do this...perhaps their local bank is in cahoots...theoretically, a bank won't attempt to ACH funds to another bank unless they see the funds in the account. In the US, these funds are immediately withdrawn from the sending account, so they can't be withdrawn prior to the ACH going out. Perhaps there's some delay with Nigerian (or whatever) banks that fraudsters can exploit (or the fraudster is friends with the banker).
Another thing that can happen is that the ACH-er can contest the ACH and have it withdrawn. Your local bank will often be willing to show these funds as "available" if they see an equivalent amount already sitting in your account. Or perhaps, the personal info they have on you is enough for them to trust that you won't try to screw them because they have recourse.
Seems to me it would be a nice Cypherpunk experiment to try to set up some kind of anonymous account and try to trap the ACH, and withdraw it as fast as possible. I guess the question is, can egold (or whatever) receive ACHs? And of course, it would be nice that a fellow cypherpunk didn't (or couldn't) swindle the rest of us if we were some how able to bitch-slap these critters.

They can be eavesdropping while surfin porn all without leaving their desk and cup of coffee. Hey--if they want me that bad these days, it would probably be cheaper just to send the van and beat whatever they need out of me.

That was nothing compared to the real damage, which I've heard few people point out.

The result was that Wall Street was basically cut off for several days...the effect of that dwarfs all the other stuff. (Although I wonder...Pipar Jaffrey was pretty much wiped out.

However, where I have some BIG doubts is whether their fab is X generations ahead of the most advanced commercial fabs. Frankly, I bet they have a pretty good fab that was modified by a commercial vendor to support small production runs. This fab, however, does not utilize cosmic rays for etching or whatever. It's probably 0.13 microns at best (wait...I think Taiwan Semi and a couple of other places are one step ahead of this). This limits what they can do with a chip or chipset, and implies that they won't be orders of magnitude better at opening up LOTS of traffic.

Well, perhaps but perhaps not. Burst-mode signaling, transceivers, and networking technology are a good example. If you see DISA, NSA, and DARPA all working with the acknoledged experts inthe academic field, and if you see them spending $$$ on burst-mode testbeds, then it's clear that there are some issues they haven't solved. Of course, they may not be the issues WE think they are, but you get some idea.
What that also hints at is that they can't actually always backhaul EVERYTHING. Their interest in burst-mode indicates they still view bandwidth as an obstacle (and not dark fiber, but actual lit bandwidth). Of course, their bandwidth "problem" is probably at orders of magnitude greater than we'd consider a problem, but their continued interest in burst mode probably indicates there are times when they have huge amounts of data that needs to get through i a short amount of time, and they don't want to clog up a Well, there's the famous Adaptive Optics story centered around bringing Manua Kea online. When the Manua Kea designers were trying to solve some of the big issues ca. 1988, the military (as part of one of their dual-use programs) declassified Laser Guidestar research they had done in 1962!
In other cases you can, however, take a reasonably good guess. Remember, during the bubble there was billions poured in by the private sector in making lasers more efficient, smaller, etc...There just happen to be physical limitations. But I have zero doubt that the NSA can't make a laser that is siginificantly more efficient than what I can buy off the shelf.
Actually, this is a most interesting point. Those cables are not merely giant rubber hoses running around on the sea floor...the telecom equipment is actually powered via an electrical layer in the cable sheath. And then remember that there are lots of fibers in any one of those cables, and that the signal therein might easily need to be amplified due to splice losses. So that Sub (which I know exists) must really be something to see. Almost makes me want to join the dark side!

You say a lotta good shit here, but you're really out of your area in this case. You seem to miss the basic points, and then fill in your blindspot with pure theoretical conjecture. Let me point out some of the lil' flaws in your thinking....
For some things, sure. Actually I know from first hand experience. (I've actually been in an NSA, DISA, and a few other experimental network nodes.) Lots of the equipment I saw was from the big vendors, most notably Lucent and Nortel. Somewhere deeper than I had access to, however, they almost certainly use special silicon.
OK, so you're saying that this suitcase takes in say 10 OC-192s, demuxes all of them down to the DS1 level (we're at 50,000 DS1s), demaps and unpacks the ATM cells, and then reassembles all of the packets therein? Questions:
1) How does this majic box store all that data?
2) I've been in dozens of COs myself, and have worked extensively with people who have spent (collectively speaking) centuries in them. They never saw such a magic box a you describe, and indeed would certainly know about someone trying to install one. Or perhaps the NSA has developed a cloaking device making the box invisible?
2) What silicon does it use? Are you saying that the government can do a LOT better than 0.13 microns these days? Somehow I doubt it. Look at the off-the-shelf SONET chip architectures. Sure, there's lots of stuff onboard that you wouldn't need for what you're talking about, but getting rid of that stuff would still put the most advanced chip lightyears behyind what you're talking about.
3) If the majic box doesn't store the data, how does it get it back to HQ? Telepathy? Or, does it use a bank of lasers that somehow are several orders of magnitude more efficient that off-the-shelf lasers? (And let us remember that there's a fundamental constraint with bulk optics..an optical multiplexer or ciculator can't be an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength it will support.)
JA's comments about fiber exhaust are dead-on, and were not known to most of the Telecom Bubble participants. (Indicates the dude knows what he's talking about with respect to telecom.)
But dark fibers aren't a real concern. It would be easy to develop a DWDM system that operated over the L or M bands, "under" the C-band wavelengths used by a carrier. So the problem isn't the fiber, it's lighting it.
As for my comments about cable landings, I explicity stated that the splices back to VA were seen and known. And yes, I was in a position to know. (There's not a lot you can hide in a CO...it's not like they staff them with NSA agents or something.)

As for the cable landings, likewise I've never heard anyone mention that they saw any government equipment at the landings, so I suspect it's relatively minimal. A the least, it's a splice over to the FDF (THAT they've seen). At the most, they have a card in the carrier's transport gear where they've dropped-and-continued some of the traffic.

Yes, but I think it's fairly clear that if one needs to dissasemble the OC-Ns in the field, you simply need too much gear. It's going to be far easier to grab whole swathes of it and ship it back to Montana or wherever for it to be sifted through later.
What they probably do, however, is grab specific DS1s/3s locall and switch those via CALEA back to optical access points, where all of this stuff is pulled together into OC-192s or (very soon) OC-768s. As Variola suggests, once you get it back then you can plow through it at your leisure. Got a disident you want to shut down?

"Gimme an intel IXA network processor and no problem.  ATM is fixed
size data, not as tricky as IP decoding.  Predicatable bandwidth.
Stream all into megadisks, analyze later."
I'm gonna have to challenge this bit here, Variola.
Let's back up. You've got an OC-48 or OC-192 fiber and you want to grab ALL of the data in this fiber. Now I'll grant that in real life there's going to be a lot telephony circuit in there, but let's take a worst-case and assume you need ALL the data.
What's in this OC-192? Right now it definitely ain't 10Gb/s of packets. It's going to have LOTS of DS1s, DS3s and, if you're lucky, and STS-3c or two. So you'll need to first of all demux ALL of the tributaries.
Next, you've got to un-map any ATM in each of the DS1s, etc, and then pull out the IP data from the ATM cells, remembering to reassemble fragmented packets (and there will be plenty with ATM). And remember, you may have to do this for 5000 simultaneous DS1s. Oh, and let's not forget pointer adjustments. You can't just blindly grab stuff...remember that all those tribs come from different STRATUM 1/3 clocks, so they'll be moving at different speeds and as a result have periodic slips w.r.t the STS-192 And that's just one fiber. How will you actually get all of this traffic back to HQ? Remember, it keeps coming and won't stop.
No, I think I'm becomming convinced that they can't yet get ALL of it. But they DO probably grab complete wavelengths and backhual them, storing them for later study. (They must do some grooming too. For instance, they probably CALEA everything into and out of Brooklyn, and then that will get switched over to the Beltway where it will be packed into a GIG-BE OC-768 back to storage and processing.)

JA, ya' gotta good point here. Or at least, this sheds a lot of doubt on But then again, the purpose of GIG-BE may be precisely to move an optical copy (use a $100 splitter) back to processing centers where the traffic is stored. In this case, they won't even be trying to break it down to circuits prior to storage...they may instead dump the raw OC-Ns directly onto some kind of fast storage medium and then sift through it later.
The idea of duplicating all optical traffic seems a little farfetched, though, but I bet everything from the cable landings may soon get swallowed whole, if it isn't already. I'm still thinking they must do some kind of "grooming" prior to mass backhauls of traffic. There are just too many fibers and too many transmission systems out there for them to duplicate all of it. Perhaps at the routers they sniff, and then CALEA whatever circuit that conversation came out of.

Well, there's no doubt that what Variola says is basically correct.
But it doesn't exactly apply to the specific situation I was referring to, which was whether something "inconspicuous" might be slipped into a CO unbeknownst to the rank-and-file (ie, the CO manager would probably receive some kind of order saying there'd be a special installation one day..."just leave those guys alone and don't worry about the little box they're putting in...it just measures traffic is all"). But the kind of iron that would be needed to unpackage and then pull out and record pretty much "everything" would still be a huge, power-hungry beast with mutliple racks and cards. Why do I say this? Well...
When I spoke of 0.13um technology, my thought had nothing to do with the yield, but merely with the size/power of the device. Examination of current off-the-shelf chip architectures (and network processors are still a couple of years behind the ASICs) indicates that, unless a LOT of chips in that range are used, they wouldn't be able to do the above.
This means they've got to do all this unpacking in some kind of central location (ie, not a CO), where I do believe what Variola speaks of is possible. BUT, they've got to get it all there. This means they'd either have to put in tons of lasers and gear (essentially creating a 1:1 copy of the current transport network), or else CALEA the most likely batches of traffic and then send it back. They probably WANT to get it all (GIG-BE, anyone?) but they simply don't have the gear nor power nor footprint available to them. If nothing else, it would be hugely conspicious. There'd be no way to hide it from the craft, nor from the rest of the world (all that gear would need a big army of secret craftpersons).
This leads me back to burst mode. I'm sure there are many uses for burst mode, but I'd also bet this is one of the drivers. It's probably worth examining whether they're putting a lot of money into signaling. Look for unheard of startups as paying members of OIF and the GMPLS fora.
No, the NSA is probably generations ahead in some areas, but their fabs aren't much better than what's available commercially.

Well, as a research toy QC seems gee-wiz super cool.
I'm still not super-impressed by the current set of applications.
In particular, consider that random number generator. Although QM does indeed predict that experimental outcomes will be 'random', they are random within the weightings imposed by the measuring apparatus. In a sense, this is the perfect analog to the notion that, "Your crypto algorithm may be unbreakable, but your hard/software ain't."
Consider...I set up my random number generator to spit out a 1 every time a photon passes through a half-silvered mirror, and a 0 every time it reflects. Over time the silvering on the mirror is going to degrade, or perhaps it's already not perfect but you need a large number of 'measurements' and/or analysis to begin to see it. In any event, your probabilities are going to shift over time, yielding an imperfect distribution of 0s/1s. Sure, it's still "random", but the probability density function is no longer useful for many applications.
Right now I can't see why this would be any more desirable than, for instance, grabbing the outcome of some distinctly nonlinear process, or perhaps many other approaches to RNG. The only thing this does is allow users/buyers to think their system is now free of any deep technical issues that may make classical systems insecure.

Yes, I am indeed a little suspicious. Clearly, this "quantum repeater" can't be doing an O/E, or no amount of hype will budge this product an inch.
Quantum Crypto utilizes pairs of correlated photons, so we can't be talking about an optical amplifer.
So since I've been away from the literature for a while, is there a device that can repair a deteriorating, about-to-be-collapsed superposition state? I can't see how this could occur without the requirement of acting on the other (correlated) photon either, and if that photon is physically removed from the first, then forget about it. (Though theoretically I think I can conceive of the possibility of two "correlated quantum repeaters" exchanging 'information' (including gating) about the photon pair they are collectively handling*, but no way that can be useful commerically.)
*: This isn't quite as farfetched as it seems: Even 5 to 10 years ago it was shown that there can be quantum Forward Error Correction, and simple devices were demonstrated in the laboratory.

Oops. You're right. It's been a while. Both photons are not utilized, but there's a Private channel and a public channel.

Which means that, should a $75K/year NSA employee want to strike it really, really rich, they'd be able to procure advanced notice of any mergers/acquisition deals.

Actually, that's an interesting point.
In places like downtown NYC, if the fiber doesn't actually go to the basement of a building, it will certainly go within a few 100 feet, so that last hop is trivial. (But the kind of companies this would be targeted for this would already have fiber to the premises or FTTP anyway....however, that fiber will only on occasion make it all the way to the telecom room...the internal building wiring will often be copper.)
However, it's not like you'd have a continuous piece of fiber all the way from Customer X Location A to Customer X Location B...you'd definitely go through at least one fiber distributing frame (FDF) aka an optical "patch panel". However, the connectors will almost certainly be at least slightly anisotropic, so you'd get a wavefunction collapse, or at least diminish the distance you can go.
So I imagine they actually perform a splice and remove the connectors...this will limit you of course to new, high quality fiber (which is extremely isotropic, and I know this for a fact having previously done a lot of testing for PMD, or Polarization Mode Dispersion.)
An interesting thing to think about is the fact that in dense metro areas, you pretty much have a "star" from the CO out to a premise (which is the cause of deployment of "Collapsed SONET Rings"). This means the other photon of your encrypted pair might easily pass through the same CO somewhere, which would make the system suscpetible to a sort of man in the middle attack. Or at least, your fancy quantum crypto system has defaulted back to standard crypto in terms of its un-hackability.

OK, I'll bite. Or rather...
Well, your initial postulate was stated in such a way as to be fairly unrefutable, the key word being "float". Only companies, etc...provide that by requiring that the transacted funds flow through their coffers for a moment, where they extract their discount revenue. At this stage of the game, nobody when their head screwed on tight would argue that Internet-based businesses don't represent an increase in Risk (whether that increase will eventually make float-based business models impossible is an entirely different matter).
Interestingly, the Visa organization recently launched a Purchasing Card platform which merely facilitates EFTs (a step towards your oft-mentioned "Geodesic Society"?)...there's a fixed and small discount revenue touch that's independent of the size of the transaction (and they can afford to do this because there's no float, ergo no risk). In this case, Visa is providing "value added" information systems for the transactions, but in a sense they're allowing their member banks to more or less completely step out of the transaction if they wish.
Now of course, Paragraph 2 is only related to Paragraph 1 by the fact that I wrote both of them in one post. To my knowledge, Visa's new PCard platform has nothing to do with Internet-based risk PER SE, but in the long run I'll doubt we'll lable this a coincidence.

Next comes the financial district and Wall Street as a whole. The third (and as it turned out by far the most impactful) was the destruction of the Telecom Central Office in  World Trade Center, along with bringing off-line the big Verizon CO across the street. These actually caused Wall Street to be knocked off line for several days, an impact that is hard to underestimate.

OK, so you not only want to stop anybody odd looking from getting on an airplane, you want near-welfare, minimum-wage HS dropouts be responsible for determining what "odd" means?
Huh? The one flaw in this logic is that this only works if you can send this particular definition of suspicious "looks" backwards in time. The shoe-bomber is a particularly interesting case, as I believe the dude was ethnically British. He might have looked odd from the photo you saw circulated in the press, but I'd bet a lot of money no one would have picked him as looking like a terrorist. However, since we now know about what the shoe-bomber looks like, it should be relatively easy to stop his genetic clones or identical twins from boarding planes in the future. "Problem Solved" indeed. However, this might not work against people that DON'T look like the shoe-bomber.
Hum. An interesting, Stalinist logic. Well, Stalin was on a certain level immensely practical. I say we build a big electrified fence around Cobble Hill Brooklyn and fuck 'em...SOMEONE in there is definitely Al-Qaeda, therefore let's assume everyone in there's guilty until proven innocent.

Uhm...no Geneva convention or anything? What the hell, it's a free-for-all anyway!
Wow. Since Iranians are Indo-European (ie, white), then in the event of war with Iran would you advocate rounding up all Americans of Indo-European ancestry? Does this have to be "pure", or should we grab the African Americans too (which have large % of Indo-European genes)?
Oh wait, most of the Afghans are Indo-Europeans too. So if you're arrested then you'll certainly understand that we're really just protecting the US from your possible collusion with your relatives in Afghanistan...

The main flaw in the whole "save the world" logic is that it assumes that some regime (Islamist, Communist or whatever) would actually be able to hold on to everybody in perpetuity, and I think history is now at the point where we have a good indication that this ain't the case.
In the case of China, Vietnam and, to some extent, the Islamists, I don't get the impression that a hatred of free markets was he underlying reason for the adoption of commusim (or whatever). Communism was merely a political pole that could be held on to so as to crystallize a movement whereby outside influences could be pushed out, and then the internal issues resolved. I would argue that the more we proclaim ourselves to be the evanglists for free markets throughout the world, and then ram our cocks up Abu Ghraib inmates asses, to the same extent what we have to offer looks tainted and foul. They need to puish us out so they need to reject free markets. They need to reject free markets so a new "pole" is created.
Mr Donald woul think that I argue against free markets, but instead what I am arguing against is methodology which retards free markets.

But I don't really want to debate that point, but instead focus on Iraq.
In Iraq this philosophy of "saving the locals from tyrrany" has taken a new turn. In this case, I actually believe that George W, Dick Cheney and the whole cabal believe that:
1. The best thing for the Iraqis would be a western-style free-market economy. (Check?)
2. An Iraqi free market would slowly stabilise the whole middle east region. 3. Iraq has resources (ie, oil) that could be utilized to kick-start a true industrialized economy (Check?)
4. The US has the ability to extract that oil and then turn those dollars into local goods-and-services, thus kickstarting forementioned Iraqi industrialization (Check?)
5. Meanwhile, Saddam was really, really bad and a terrorist and he's got all sorts of scary WMDs.
6. It is therefore in everybody's best interests for the US to kick out Saddam and get this party started.
7. Oh, and the US will benefit too (as we should) as we help ole' man Iraq get back on his feet.
But apparently, the locals are not particularly happy about the unilateral decisions we've been making in their benefit. Of course, you might chalk this up to fanaticism/Islam or whatever, but I suspect they just don't trust us (Abu Ghraib), and remember the fact that it was the US that propped up Saddam as long as he stuck to the script.
Who knows? If Bush & Co are able to steal this election, maybe in a year or two (after the death toll hits the 5 digit mark) we'll start hearing about how Saddam wasn't so bad after all, and why don't we give him a second chance? (We'll watch him closely, so don't you worry!)

And in most cases the best of these can concoct an answer to anything you throw at him. As far as I'm concerned, that's the whole point of going through this excersize (ie, of finding a way to rationalize pretty much ANY form of violence/terrorism.) The danger comes when a nation (ie, the guys who control the guns) is run by the apolegists, or people who hold similar Put in another way, just because you really really REALLY believe you are right doesn't give anyone the right to create huge amounts of turmoil and death in someone else's country.

Taiwan is a particularly odd example...it definitely has started forming a modern economy, but then again it had many decades of oppression. It also had swiped billions upon billions of dollars of gold and other substances that backed the Chinese monetary system prior to 1949, so arguably that money had to go somewhere.

Well, let's dig into this. It appears on the surface to harbour a lot of the common myths shared in the hallowed corridors of DC.
Most Cypherpunks would agree that free markets are a good thing. Basically, if you leave people alone, they'll figure out how to meet the needs that are out in there and, in the process, get a few of the goodies available to us as vapors on this world. I assume you would agree to this.
That said, the question is whether American interference abroad has helped or possibly greatly hindered the formation of free markets. And I think the verdict is beocmming increasingly clear that American interference hurts free markets. Of course, there are the arguable exceptions: Post-war Germany and Japan, but these countries not only had a strong history of free markets at the time they both ahd large corporations and a rapidly modernizing In developing markets the US track record is terrible. The more we interfere and set up puppet governments and petty dictators, the result has always been the near elimination of any kind of real modern economy.
More than that, some of the countries we've been kicked out or prevented from influencing have been modernizing rapidly, the most obvious example is China and Vietnam. Bolivia is interesting to watch.
One could in fact argue that the faster a country removes our shadowy "help", the sooner they can get on their own two feet and start developing. In this light, US influence starts to look like it's on some levels designed to quash the local development of modern industrialization and perhaps this is no suprise: We don't really want the competition.
In the long run this is unsustainable, and can only lead to even bigger September 11ths.  under there and examine the substance of what he's saying.

So there was no Vietnam war? The US was not involved? It didn't occur in the 60s? Are you saying that the cultural revolution didn't begin in approximately 1966? That the Sino-Soviet split didn't occur in the late Like I said: Uh...wha?
Let's put it this way: Mao and China clearly interpreted US involvement around China (ie, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc...) as having a lot to do with containing the 'communist meanace' and restoring the Chiang regime to power (we had funded Chiang and the incredibly corrupt Soongs with billions of $ during the 30s and 40s). Whether you agree with this actually constituting "aggression" or not is almost irrelevant. Clearly, our involvement in all of those areas (along with the rhetoric along with MacArthur's words which got him fired) could easily be interpreted as such.
But let's sidestep this and point out that it's the US that did this then and is doing this in the middle east. Almost no other countires can be said to be involved in a meaningful way. So is it your belief that the US is somehow more moral/courageous/godfearing than all the other countries in the world? Why is it always us (and not other countries) meddling in foreign affairs? Doesn't that strike you as odd? Is it merely a coincidence that we continue to be the focus of lots of international hostility?

Basically the way I see it. I've felt for a long time that the US (even while pursuing it's questionable goals) should have jumped all over the chance to buddy-up with China after the Sino-Soviet split, and knowing Mao's practicality I'd bet he could have been pursuaded (hell, not long after it was Mao and Zhou who initated contact with the US). Relations with Vietnam and Cambodia could have proceeded very differently in that environment. Would the cultural revolution still have happened? Probably. Would the Khmers have gotten into power...possibly but I actually doubt it.
But of course, we were still in the middle of McCarthy-ism, so way too ideologically blind to see the obvious. As a result we continued to mindlessly pursue ideology rather than practicality and so ended really making things worse in SE Asia, in a place where Marxism was really a useful but temporary veneer over local politics (again we were too blind to see that Marxism was a western transplant that wasn't going to do too well in Asia). And we're doing it again...(eg, we had some chances with Iran recently that we passed up...that was really stupid, and the Iranians seem to know it).

You say a lot of wacky stuff, so it suprises me that I find this pragraph to actually make some sense.
No. You've got to do more reading. Sihoanouk was in power and loosely held a coalition together. In part because he believed it and in part because it was necessary to hold this coalition together, Sihoanouk did not spout particularly pro-American rhetoric. As a result, the US/CIA backed Lon Nol to overthrow Sihoanouk. Lon Nol could by no means hold things together , so in swept the Khmer Rouge, backed by Mao and the Chicoms.
Let's remember some facts here: The US backed the ferociously corrupt Chiang regime, even helping them sack China's treasuries. The US fought China in Korea and was now occupying it. MacArthur threatened to make China a nuclear "Parking Lot". The US was in Vietnam trying to fight their way up. So it would have been pretty evident to anyone watching that the US was trying to undermine the PRC. In fact, this was also a main motivation for the Cultural Revolution: Mao wanted to move heavy industry out into the countryside, away from easy bomb-ability by the Americans. (Of course, that idea was actually used by Mao for consolidating his politcal power which was always with the peasants, but that's besides the point).
Mao did the reasonable thing and fought us (and won) in all 3 theaters. I'll agree with you pretty quickly if you say Mao was a fairly Stalinist butcher, but in any event he made use of the Khmer Rouge to push a US-backed puppet out of the peninsula. Note that only after Mao kicked our asses repeatedly did Nixon and Kissinger decide to make friends with Mao and the PRC (which was the smart thing to do all along after the Sino-Soviet split).
What if the US had not followed such an aggressive policy towards the PRC? Chinese history gives us a clear indication: They would never have backed the Khmer Rouge. (Sihoanouk regularly traveled to China before and after that time, BTW, and was moderately friendly with Jong Nan Hai.) In addition, the notion of having to hide Chinese industry from the Americans could never have been used as a credible reason for lauching the Cultural Revolution.
In the end, our policies in SE Asia likely caused millions to be killed, and in the end were self-defeating. A complete fiasco. And the same thing is happening in the Middle East.
So even if one agrees that your goals are 'admirable' (and I question that), your methods would also be a complete, unmitigated disaster.

Well, when push comes to shove I have to admit Mr Donald doesn't mince words. Guess that's what Cypherpunks is for!
As was stated elesewhere, there is sfirst of all the problem of -who- determines the meaning of objectionable. Is it the latest DC regime? You make it seem like you espouse a philosophy that makes it easy and obvious to see what's objectionable.
More than that, however, this may be completely self-defeating. Most governments are not static entities. Some will evolve or die via relatively Darwinian processes, and interference really ends up being self-defeating, or possibly far worse.
I won't belabor my favorite example of China--Vietnam--Cambodia, but it's clear to me things could have been completely different had the US not espoused blatantly aggressive policies towards China in particular. In this context a very strong case can be made that the US caused the Khmer Rouge to come to power, precisely by performing in a way similar to what you espouse. We also had opportunities to ally with China early on, and let's remember we were allies with Ho Chi Min during WWII. But all we did is blindly pursue a policy that ended up devliering precisely OPPOSITE to what you would seem to espouse. And we're doing the same thing in the middle east.

You seem to equate disagreement with your assessment with a viewpoint that is completely To say that China was "despotic" would, on average, be accurate. But then again, one must remember that a form of despotism where the despots are months away is very different from modern forms of despotism.
Today's China is in some ways similar to China during many dynasties. The emperor sleeps some insect with a big, fat stinger awakens him and then he gets mad, swats it, and then goes back to sleep. When the locals are fairly certain the emperor is sleeping soundly, they go about their business.

Ah. This is an interesting point.
The Qing were 1) Manchus (ie, not Han Chinese)...they were basically a foreign occupation that stuck around for a while; and 2) (Nominally Tibetan) Buddhists. Although they of course adhered to the larger Confucian notions, they in many ways deviated from mainstream Confucian beliefs.
Also, you need to get more specific about WHEN during the Qing dynasty you believed this occurred. During the 19th century this is most certainly NOT true, and there are many famous naval battles that occurred between the British and the Chinese navies (in fact, the famous Stone Boat in the Summer palace was built using funds that were supposed to pay for real ships).
But perhaps you meant ocean-going boat ownership by private individuals, and that is certainly something that was a BIG no-no during many epochs of Chinese civilization. And indeed, this is probably precisely why the Chinese had to defend themselves from British attack, rather than the other way But this has nothing to do with Confucianism per se, but is more directly related to good old traditional Chinese xenophobia.
In the end, Chinese unification was probably a devil's bargain. It created a far more stable "nation", but at the cost of human freedom. But it's not precisely like this was imposed on the populace from without...that it was successful at all in a place as large and remote as China is a testimony to Chinese dislike of "Wai Guo" culture.

OK, Mr Donald. You clearly imagine the China of 2,500 years ago to operate like a modern 20th century nation-state. You need to rethink this, given a few simple facts:
1. There were no telephones during Confucious' time.
2. Several provinces of China are larger than all of Western Europe. Even a very high-priority message could take months to propagate.
3. "Control' of China 2500 years ago was almost nonexistent. It was a geographically, ethnically, and linguistically diverse set of quasi-nation-states. To even imagine them to be anything like a modern nation state indicates you are extrapolating your bizarre little philosophical universe well beyond the breaking point. (But then again, that wasn't too hard!)
4. Event the early Ryu-Jya (Legalists) were nothing like what you imagine modern laws to be. In fact, their activity probably centers on creating an established set of standardized weights (ie, for weighing food and whatnot). "Law" in early China was NOTHING like what you imagine it to be, and was a higly decentralized affair. Indeed, modern China is rapidly 'deteriorated' into the same.

Again, you seem to visualize me as (-1) times yourself, or basically your old commie self.
The point I continue to harp on (and that you fail to understand) is that, despite how well one may argue that one sees reality 'objectively' (and others don't), completely alternate viewpoints are possible and very often held by others throughout the world. An action like the US in Iraq (irregardless of what you believe the objective reality to be) is futile precisely because it only re-inforces the world view of the locals (ie, that the US is a giant, bullying oppressive regime that has stuck it's big dick into the holy land and needs force to remove it).
In other words, perception is often reality, and until you (and others like you) accept that, then we'll continue to have bloodbath after bloodbath, initated by 'Christian' and 'Islamic' true believers alike.

Mr Donald's comments are almost completely nonsensical. or rather, they vaguely reflect some aspects of reality glimpsed through a really fucked up mirror while on bad crack.
Probably Mr Donald is referring to something he saw on TV about China's response (or relative lack of response) to Japan's Meiji Restoration.
China definitely did not respond to foregin ideas of industrialization and technology like the Japanese did. (Or at least, not at the time!) But it should be remembered that China did slowly and steadily evolve it's technology, and was well ahead of the western world until the Enlightenment.
However, blaming the Chinese response to the Meiji restoration on officially unsanctioned thought illustrates a complete cluelessness about China. During that time Chinese intellectuals (which at the time meant practically anyone who had any kind of an education) regularly debating notions of "Ti Yung", or the tension between what is esentially Chinese vs what's useful from the Western World (and by the 1860s it was starting to become clear that the west had some advanced ideas). This is far more than a top-down dictatorship in the Stalinist sense, just as the Cultural Revolution was for more than a bunch of teenagers "obeying orders".
In the end, a simplistic (though not clueless) argument could be made that China decided to remain "Chinese" rather than embrace what would have been a big disruption to their way of life. As it turned out, the 20th century (and the Japanese) more or less forced this new way of life on them.
Hell..come to think of it, the closest precedent to the US invasion of Iraq might be the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.

Ah. A fellow knowledgeable China-hand.
As far as I'm concerned, what Kung Tze does ca 5 BCE is really consdolidate and codify a large and diverse body of practices and beliefs under a fairly unified set of ethical ideas. In that sense, the Legalists were merely a refocusing of the same general body of mores, etc...into a somewhat different direction. One might call it a competing school to Kung Tze de Jiao Xun, but I would argue only because, at that time, Kung Tze "authority" as it's known today was by no means completely established. But in a sense, the early legalists weren't a HECK of a lot different from Confucious.
As for Mr Donald's ramblings, the are in which they most closely approach reality is where filial obedience to the emperor is developed as an extension to his ethical system, but even here there are significant differences. For one, that filial loyalty is not portrayed as being ultimately political, but almost an extension of family (which is why the emperor was known as the "Son of Heaven").
Also, and this is fairly Cypherpunkish, unlike in the west the notin of Emperor was not ultimately a genetic one. That is, there's a "Mandate of Heaven", and when the mandate of heaven is removed from an Emperor and his line, it's time to bum-rush his show, which was done on a regular basis in As for the Taoists this comment by Mr Donald is almost completely

This is where the "Simplistic Grid" comes in. The momentum of Chinese culture will oalways outlive any short-term despotism, and the Chinese on many levels know this. When it comes to China, even some of the Han-dominated areas are incredibly difficult to get to, and when you start talking about Southern parts of Yunnan, most parts of Tibet, and places like Qinhai and Xinjiang, the idea of a lightening-fast and efficient despotism starts to sound dubious. Indeed, these areas are only barely under Beijing control today. It's also a main reason why Burma and the Golden triangle find it very easy to ship heroin overland through China to Hong Kong rather than go at it via a more direct route.
Anhui and central China suffered far more than other parts of China. I'd guess that 70% of the deaths due to starvation during 58 to about 64 occurred in that part of Central China. The obvious reasons were: 1) Proximity and easy communicatuion with Beijing, and 2) Large tracts of previously arable land (ie, you don't bother exerting despotism over an area that can't do much anyway).
No, I am arguing that Chinese communism was a different thing from Soviet commusim, for the precise reason that the weight of Chinese history would be fairly quick to erase Chinese commusim. Any China hand could have predicted exactly that, and indeed that's precisely what happened. Our decision to back the far-more corrupt Chiang regime all the way to 1973 or whenever, was a major blunder, if for no other reason then to accelerate the isolation of the Soviets. Mao would have been very hip to the manuever, and I bet would have welcomed it (The Soviets were never very useful to the Chinese communists). In other words, even a smart rabid anti-communist should have recognized that backing Mao's "Bandits" was at some point obvious, but most were far too blinded by their ideology to see that.
The same thing's happening with Iraq and Iran. Iran's making overtures that we consistently ignore because were too darned dumb and power-oriented to see the opportunity.

You are apparently simply unaware of the real size and terrain of China. There were villages in remote parts of China that were unaware of Mao's death into the early 1980s. Travel around in China for a while and you'll get the picture. Just to give you an idea, short of renting out a helicopter, there are plenty of parts of China that are more than a week away from even me, living here in NYC.
No, as usual you seem to think that because I disagree with the simplicity of your "grid" that I must believe the opposite. Let's put it this way: The Qin was absolutely despotic in areas that could be guessed at ("Burn Books Kill Scholars"), as well as quite despotic in areas that would seem pointless now (like bell volumes, because bells were also measurements for grain). They also completely didn't care about other things that you would think a despot would really care about.
A thing to think about was that Qin Shr Huang seemed to truly believe that everything he did was necessary for the unification of China (which he accomplished). YOU (not me) might argue that by unifying a large portion of central China he actually prevented a lot more deaths due to "Barbarian" incursion by "Unfree and uncivilized" Muslims...OOPS--Did I say that?

And the remotest parts of China at that time (the borders are far larger now, of course) weren't any closer than a month or two, no matter what the orders. (Qin Shr Huang probably was no idiot...if it was physically impossible then he could not gain power.)
You seem to be thinking that I am arguing that Qin Shr Huang was not a despot. However, comparisons to modern totalitarian states are filled with
Well, this was difficult given that there were probably a good number of Qin Shr Huang's 'subjects' that didn't even know they were subjects until well after Qin Shr Huang died. Camodia is just a TEENSY bit smaller than China.
Now the reason this excersize is not completely futile is that it's pretty clear that the notion of a "Despot" is very different from place to place.

By Halal (are you getting this term confused with that for Islamic version of Kosher? I think the name is similar but not this) Do you mean that system of monetary transfers whereby local services are exchanged in place of direct cash transfer? (In other words, if I want to sell something abroad the money is actually wired to a 3rd party who appears to the authorities not to have anything to do with any purchasing...this person then obtains services or perhaps local cash in lieu of the money he transferred. The system seems to operate largely on trusted intermediaries, along with a series of barters...)
Well, this system may technically be illegal, but it's done all the time in the wilds of Queens, both by middle easterners as well as South Americans, and I see little that could be done to stop it. Even the feds can't keep up with bugging all the Dominican brothels on Roosevelt Avenue.
It is, in effect, an analog Blacknet, though transactions are of course probably limited to the low 5-figure range without some kind of big tipoff, but I'm sure the locals are fully aware of the threshold values.
The only way are true police state could crack down would be to nuke Queens, which they might actually allow Al Qaeda to do if they chose to (seems like Al Qaeda could come in handy for a lot of things..."Oh, where did that baddie bin Laden go...guess we'll never find him...")

The idea of Jewish "Scripture" is far more complex than can be described in a short amount of time.
Clearly, the Torah is far more important than anything, even the other books of the "Old Testament" (for Jews the Old testament is actually in 3 or 4 books). The Torah is the only piece of Jewish scripture said to be dictated letter-by-letter to Moses.
Now there are several "rings" of lesser works concentric around the Torah, including the Talmud and the Mishra and then a couple of dozens of centuries of other stuff. The Talmud is often called the "Oral Torah", but even this designates a slightly inferior status, being the written version of words originally spoken by Moses. The Mishnah are not scriptures at all, technically, though they can be given great reverence depending on the Rabbi that wrote/spoke a particular section.
Contrast that to the Protestant notion of Go/NoGo for scriptures...we don't even have the Apocryhpa anymore, despite the fact that Martin Luther had it in his Bible and quoted from it. It's eaither divinely inspired or it ain't...a simplisitic idea that probably helped spread Protestantism to the poor and uneducated.
In short, it's silly to somehow get on the Jews for something that shows up in some commentary written 20 centuries ago (eg, Baylonian Talmud).

Well, the first thing to remember is that Arabic more or less has a built-in method for distributing covert information...kind of like Hebrew, an Arabic word can be viewed in terms of a subset of consonants...for specific groupings there are lots of well-known associated words with the same letters. I'd bet a careful examination of bin Laden communiques will reveal the existence of pointers to such special words...the initated will know how to pull out those words and use them as passwords, etc...
As for the sophistication of Al Qaeda software, remember we're probably not talking about a very centrally-organized group. Their members are scattered in all sorts of socio-eco-bandwidth environments so that off-the-shelf (where shelf=internet) stuff is going to be common.
Remember too that broad categories of Stego can apparently be detected by FFT (someone here posted a link to a paper describing that). Put that and all sorts of other routines looking for specific Stego signatures inot a Variola suitcase and I bet they (NSA, though not police) can pull out practically anything they want to. BUT...that probably doesn't do them a ton of good...the plaintext will be in Arabic, it will speak symbolically, and maybe use some even more clever techniques for info obfscuration.
As for the 'semaphore' theory I consider that likely...lots of info will be sent out-of-band (ie, verbally) and Stego'd info will perhaps be triggers or possibly meeting coordinates. Maybe an account number every now and then (VERY easy to hide using Arabic letter-numerals).

NSA folks, on the other hand, I would assume have a soft version of a Variola Stego suitcase...able to quickly detect the presence of pretty much any kind of stego and then perform some tests to determine what kind was used. I bet they've been aware of Al Qaeda stego for a long time...that's probably the kind of thing they are very very good at.
In the end it probably comes down to Arabic, however, and that language has many built-in ways of deflecting the uninitiated. I'd bet even NSA has a hard time understanding an Arabic language message, even after they de-stego and translate it.

Good presentation. I liked the boot diagrams quite a bit.
Prediction (and remember you heard it here first): TCPA will fail. Oh it'll see some spot uses, don't get me wrong. These spot uses might even remain for a while. But the good thing is that Microsoft is probably going to have to carry the ball on this one, and they'll think they have a few iterations to iron out the bugs. But users will defect in droves as all sorts of unexpected and wacky things start to happen and they'll defect in droves.
Right about then even some of the studios are going to begin to understand that by choking off the spigot they'll be choking their own product flow which will have to increasingly compete with independents (who can distribute music over the internet just as easily as SONY can). So some genius will make a convincing enough boardroom presentation showing that the additional revenues they gain through TCPA is far more than overset by the effective loss of advertising. That realization will hit just as the general public starts learning what TCPA is and why their computer is as buggy and crashy as it was during the Windows 95 days.
Boo hoo.

Well, DISTANCE makes it more complicated first of all. You need undersea repeaters and/or OFAs in order to get traffic from most parts of the ocean back to land, and the NSA will in many cases not want nor be able to use the "host" service providers' OFAs. This would mean they'd have to install their own, and I doubt they're going to just plop on their own regeneration site on the outside of a civilian cable.
Hum. In some parts of the ocean they must almost certainly have their own cable and then couple stolen traffic into it. I'd bet there also must exist some mini-Echelons on some Islands somewhere (like Majorca or the Azores) where they do some grooming and listening.

Well, basically it's pretty simple. Someone will eventually recognize that the idea has a lot of economic potential and they'll go to Sand Hill and get some venture funds. 6 months later you'll be able to sign up for "Spam Mail". Eventually the idea will spread and Spammers, who are already squeezed via Men With Guns, will start running out of options and so will be willing to pay, for instance, 1 cent per email. After that, of course, the price will likely go up, except for crummier demographics that are willing to read email for 1 cent/spam.
Actually, this points to why Spam is Spam...Spam is Spam because it has zero correlation to what you want. Look at Vogue, etc...it's a $10 magazine consisting mostly of advertisements, but they're the advertisements women want. Pay-to-Spam will work precisely because it will force Spammers to become actual marketers, delivering the right messages to the right demographics..in that context the Price to send spam is a precise measure of Spammers lack-of-marketing savvy and/or information. Hell, if they're good enough at it they'll probably get women to pay THEM to spam 'em.

@_subject: RE: What is a cypherpunk? 
Well, I agree with the general gist of this post though not it's specific OK...a Cypherpunk ultimately believes that technology and, in particular, crypto give us the defacto (though, as you point out, not dejure) right to certain levels of self-determination and that this 'right' is ultimately exerted indepedent of any governing bodies. In the end, most likely despite any governing bodies. Moreover, it has been argued (in general fairly well, I think) that attempting to exert one's 'rights' through a 'democratically elected' mob is rarely much more than mob rule. "We have voted to ransack your home." OK, that I think is well understood.
BUT, an essentially Cypherpunkly philosophy does not preclude any kind of action in the legal/governing realm, particularly when it's recognized that said government can easily make it very difficult to live the way one wants. In other words, if Kodos is promising to start curfew laws and make possession or use of crypto a crime, I'll probably vote for Kang in the dim hopes this'll make a difference.
Things get sticky when you start talking private sector...unlike most Cypherpunks I don't subscribe to the doctrine that, "Private=Good=Proto-anarchy"...Halliburton is a quasi-government entitity, AFAIC, the CEO of which 'needs killing' ASAP. In the US Private industry has a way of entangling it's interests with that of the Feds, and vice versa, so I don't see any a priori argument against establishing some kind of "rear guard" policy to watch the merger and possibly vote once in a while. With Palladium it's easy to see the Feds one day busting down your doors when they find out you broke open the lock box and tore out their little citzen-monitoring daemon inside, which they put in there working with With respect to TCPA, however, I happen to agree with you. IN particular, I think most people will put 2 and 2 together and remember that it was Microsoft in the first place that (in effect) caused a lot of the security problems we see. Watch mass scale defections from Microsoft the moment they try a lock-box approach...or rather, the moment the first big hack/trojan/DoS attack occurs leveraging the comfy protection of TCPA.

No! Undersea?
Do you take a copy of EVERYTHING and send it back? That might have been more feasible in the old days, but when a single fiber can run 64 wavelength optically amplified 10 Gig traffic, I really really doubt it. Or at least, this would require an undertaking large enough that I doubt they could hide If they select some traffic then we have to ask, how do they select the traffic? Even there the mind boggles thinking about the kinds of gear I suspect it's a combination of all sorts of stuff...remember too that all that traffic has to land somewhere, so theoretically they can access a good deal of it terrestrially. What you might see, therefore, is a sheath coming out of, say Iran, is tapped for fibers that proceed on to other unfriendly nations, and a copy of the traffic pulled back to some nearby land-based station in a friendly country (so that lots of amplifiers aren't needed).
I'd bet you do see the occasional Variola suitcase, though, requiring a sub visit once in a while. But I bet they avoid this kind of thing as much as possible, given the traffic volumes.

When I was in Telecom we audited pieces of an undersea NSA network that was based on OC-3 ATM. It had some odd components, however, including reflective-mode LiNBO3 modulators and even acousto-optic modulators. (Actually, one of the components started dying which put them into a near-frenzy...it turned out we had someone who happened to know the designer of that very piece and so understood the failure mode completely.)
My theory is that they were multiplexing their OC-3-collected information back over the same set of fibers the intelligence came from, or else re-routed it to another "friendly" cable nearby.
These days, however, a la Variola I don't think that a single OC-3 will do even for specially-selected traffic, so they must do something different now (unless, of course, that OC-3 was just their OAM&P/control network, which is entirely possible).

Interesting. Gives a lower limit to certain storage questions. Guess it's no suprise IBM's SAN product handled things here, it's been field-tested after GENEVA -- IBM and CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, today announced that IBM's storage virtualization software has achieved breakthrough performance results in an internal data challenge at CERN.
The data challenge was part of a test currently going on at CERN to simulate the computing needs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Computing Grid, the largest scientific computing grid in the world. The LHC is expected to produce massive amounts of data, 15 million gigabytes per year, once it is operational in 2007. The recent results represent a major milestone for CERN, who is testing cutting-edge data management solutions in the context of the CERN openlab, an industrial partnership.
Using IBM TotalStorage SAN File System storage virtualization software, the internal tests shattered performance records during a data challenge test by CERN by reading and writing data to disk at rates in excess of 1GB/second for a total I/O of over 1 petabyte (1 million gigabytes) in a 13-day period. This result shows that IBM's pioneering virtualization solution has the ability to manage the anticipated needs of what will be the most data-intensive experiment in the world. First tests of the integration of SAN File System with CERN's storage management system for the LHC experiments have already obtained excellent results.
"CERN has a long-standing collaborative relationship with IBM, and we are delighted that IBM is pushing the frontiers of data management in the context of CERN openlab," said Wolfgang von Rüden, Information Technology Department Leader at CERN and Head of the CERN openlab.

@_subject: Re: SHA1 broken? 
Ah. You meant as a principal in general. Of course the prevailing wisdom is to go from FPGAs to ASICs when you have heavy tasks.
In Telecom equipment, however, there's a few issues that basically 'require' First, the standards change quite a bit, depending on which area you're in. For instance, RPR didn't really get settled until very recently. Second, your customers may ask for "more" or different kinds of functionality, so you may have a new release of firmware to address that. Putting the framing and/or PM on an FPGA while keeping the guts (eg, packet processing) on the main ASIC/processor allows you to swap out the trivial without a major heart In addition, there's probably the far more important issue of design cycle times. ASICs will take (at the very minimum) 18 months to create, and if you make a mistake early on and don't catch, you have to start all over again. For some fields that's just unacceptable.
Then again, if you're looking for sheer, brute performance and design cycle times are not a limiting factor, ASICs are often the way to go. Even in a Variola Suitcase, however, I'd bet some of the trivial functions are off-loaded to an FPGA, though, for reasons above.

Hey...I never said May was an idiot. In fact, quite the opposite. His issues with race and violence, I feel, don't emanate from stupidity by any means, but are rather codifications of some kind of issues into his thinking. Get him away from "human matters" and on the technical level he was normally very sharp.
OK, I'm punting here, and I'm not an economist. BUT, my assumption is that the costs of production of heroin is far below it's actual street value. Indeed, this is why many 3rd world economies produce such drugs.
Yes, that's precisely what the drug trade does.
Well, of course. What I'm driving at, however, is that a pegged yuan (or any currency) will have inevitable and unintended local consequences.
For instance, let's say a Chinese consumer wants to purchase US goods in China. Obviously, such goods will be extremely expensive. However, with a pegged rate, the price for such goods will no longer reflect the true differential in the price of (for instance) labor in the US and China. In other words, goods are more expensive then they have to be, due to an artificial "barrier" created by the pegged dollar:Yuan rate, and exporting legitimate goods becomes a very expensive way to buy those goods. More than this, the value of a local "yuan" (or what have you) is not what it could be if you (as an individual, not a nation) had direct access to foregin capital at a rate that truly reflects the differential in costs, efficiency, etc...
So what do you do? You export blackmarket goods for prices that reflect some sort of "reality". In addition, it probably allows local producers of other non-black-market items (some of which may not be exportable) to have access to foreign capital at the true going value, via various economic relationships with drug creators, etc....
Come to  think of it "arbitrage" is not the best term.
Of course, the actual growers and even exporters of heroin are completely unaware that their livelihoods are the result of macroeconomic conditions.
Just a thought, could be wrong, but I see nothing in the response above to indicate I'm extremely off base. It's nominally "Cypherpunk" in that it poses the question of whether central control is actually responsible for the some aspects of the drug trade.

@_subject: Golden Triangle Drug Traffic Arbitrage? 
Hey...had an interesting idea I've been discussing.
Actually, no way it's crypto but it's certainly markets/anarchy, so read on if you wish.
I'm thinking that that Drug Trafficking in the Golden Triangle might actually be a form of arbitrage.
Let me explain...
China pegs it's currency to US currency. With the dropping dollar, this means that there's going to be a larger and larger gap between 'reality' (as measured in the true cost of goods in a free market) and the pegged rate.
On Cypherpunks do I need to explain the idea that this difference will inevitably give rise to a big black market to exploit that difference? (I had a hard time explaining this to some younger Wall Street folks here.)
An interesting though I had last night was that the Drug trade in the Golden Triangle (Burma, China, Thailand, etc...) might exist for precisely this reason...in other words, as a form of arbitrage of sorts between the actual local cost of goods and services and manpower and exchange rates of the US dollar. Heroin is an ideal medium for arbitrage, as it's price is almost a pure function of supply and demand (as opposed to cost of material). It can fluctuate with the currency markets and as a result forms  a sort of 'common denominator' for translating local wealth back into international, 'real' In other words, the drug trade is a direct result of government intervention in the currency markets.
Of course, if May were here (may his soul roast in the hell of lesser lists) he'd say this was 'obvious'...

Well, as pointed out previously it may not be necessary to authenticate. If you believe you'll be passing through a high WiFi density area, and that chances are decent at least one or two of the hotspots do not require authentication, then have the app toss off a bunch of the emails and try again at the next spot. The emails should make it through somewhere (particularly in places like NYC, were there must be a dozen or more public hotspots within a block or two of where I work).
Of course, if authentication happens to be achieved, then I guess have the app delete those emails it got through.

In other words, say you want to send out a few anonymous emails, and you don't even want to enter a Cyber-cafe or whatever. So you load up the emails in your mail tool and drive down Main Street. The launcher utility detects the presence of open wi-fi hotspots and belches out a few of the emails while the spot's in range....all the while you don't even slow down.
Sounds possible to me. the only problem might be the need for authentication, etc...in some hotspots, but given enough hotspots surely there are some that don't need it...

In other words, when potential terrorists get to the States, that Hawala is probably used to funnel untaxed money into actual businesses.
MwG always want to depict the terrorists as everywhere and themselves as just barely holding back a tide of destruction.

Well, there's still the problem of private information on the server being leaked to the publically-accessible side. In other words, let's say I want to store my income on the server and then release it to certain other users in exchange for a payment. Of course, I could store such private information on my own machine, but this is problematic for several reasons (including the fact that I may want some of this information to be automatically released to anyone willing to pay the $ for it, meaaning I don't want to have to initiate a Tor session every few seconds).
But I definitely don't want a user to be able to extract private info without paying for it, and perhaps there's some info I never want released Now, having my admin not know who I am (or which reputation belongs to me) is even better, and hopefully would be solved via the same mechanism.

I keep pointing out that, given how easy it would be to blow up the midtown tunnel, for instance (never mind just taking a backhoe out into the middle of nowhere and digging up a fiber sheath), the very fact that we don't see stuff blowing up all the time is proof that there really aren't that many terrorists out there. In other words, on 9/11 we lost a solid % of them.
As a corollary, if a person is smart enough to get into the US and then be able to sustain themselves economically (never mind go to college or graduate school), the desirability of blowing oneself up goes way down.
This means then that it probably gets pretty easy to run out of legitimate TERROR! to investigate and protect us poor, terrified Americans from.

Hum...it's interesting to think about this. I assumed the control channel would be in-band for several reasons, all of which may be wrong.
Let me first of clarify, in case it wasn't clear: I'm talking about downloading the policies that will 'program' what the Narus box looks at and how it will respond. The Narus box itself likely needs it's own control channel to upgrade its own software and do OAM&P, and this will probably be over the SONET DCC overhead. But the policies itself, I think, could be in band. Consider:
1) The Narus box already does layer 4: Since it's already opening up the STS-Nc container and reading the packets, seems trivial for them to grab their own control stream out of that.
2) Depending on the architecture, if the packets are in-band then they don't need to worry about getting their control channel terminated by putting it into SONET overhead. Of course, the path overhead might actually survive untouched the whole way, but that would prevent them from terminating at an intermediate router (which they might want the option to do so as to prevent backhauling a whole nation's worth of traffic).
3) Although not a BIG deal, if they used SONET overhead they would have to put their channel into unused overhead bytes. Some chipsets do that, but it's a constraint better avoided for various reasons (including rare interoperability issues if someone else along the way is using the same bytes for something).
I don't understand the comment about bidirectional transport...this is necessary anyway, no? At least the DCC of SONET NEs need bidirectional or the SONET router (yes, there's a tiny OSI router inside SONET SEs) will declare the DCC down. Or maybe I misunderstand you...
Of course, some of these considerations go away somewhat if NSA simply backhauls all the traffic over a proprietary coast-to-coast optical network, which is not inconceivable.

This has interesting implications in terms of where they place one of these Another thing worth thinking about is the control channels they must use to update the policies to one of these boxes. It's obviously in-band. One wonders if one could tap one of the fibers and find the packet stream they use to program one of these things.

See my previous post. As for ATM being 'obsolete', well one might say this with good reason, but not because it isn't used. The core is still dominated by ATM. Waitaminue, not just the core but the edges too: DSL is basically over ATM still. As for bandwidth, that isn't a problem for ATM, though it's easy to bitch about the mapping penalties incurred by putting packets over ATM cells over OC-N.
On the other hand, having the ATM layer in there can complicate matters, and you don't need a lot of flow control if you're willing to give everyone globs of bandwidth. For both of these reasons and more G-PON is probably going to win out, and I'd suspect prices have already started to drop Need a break? Find your escape route with Live Search Maps.

Well, this barely counts as WAN! My expertise increases exponentially as you get to the core.
However, I do happen to know a small amount here, and the issues are numerous and tricky.
Let's go for the main question:
Well, basically yes: It's called PON (Passive Optical Network) and there are several flavors. The original was A-PON, wherein a home-based ONT that sits on the outside of a residence outputs ethenet into the home and maps the packets onto ATM over OC-12 upstream (as I remember) and OC-48 down. It's a weird technology in that a single OC-48 is split lots of times (32, I think) and each ONT just grabs the ATM VPI that corresponds to its owner (upstream is even weirder: All of the upstream ONTs time their burst-mode output so as to glue together a single coherent OC-12 upstream).
The real winner here is probably going to be GPON, which is basically an optically split ethernet. Each ONT is given a 'window' wherein it can broadcast upstream packets. I'm not too in touch with this technology, but I'd suspect a single GbE port on the headend switch/router can support 64 endusers. And often, these endusers can be an apartment building with a switch in the basement. If you only have a single fiber coming out of the headend, then the 'obvious' upgrade is to use Coarse-DWDM which can easily provide up to 16 cheap wavelengths. In other words, that's 16 GbE ports (no, the PHY is not quite the same as the GBICs have to be burst mode).
BT and other big companies have been building out fiber-to-the-home architectures using PONs, and I think I've heard prices quoted for the ONT as low as $250, but I could be wrong.
Of course, there are  lot of people who don't like PON, and depending on how much fiber you've got in the nieghborhood and the quality of the copper in the last mile, PON might easily not deliver as much bandwidth as a hybrid Get a preview of Live Earth, the hottest event this summer - only on MSN

Well, the need for optical amplifiers is not so much a power availability issue so much as a complexity issue. If one has dozens or hundreds of fibers, remember that each of these is going to be some random wavelength in the 1310nm or 1550nm band: You won't be able to use a single optical amplifier to amplifiy multiple wavelengths: You'll need one for each fiber.  So now, you need the space and the manpower (not to mention electrical power and heat dissipation) to handle a lot of OFAs.
Now I wouldn't be suprised if there existed a VERY small in-line EDFA (erbium-doped fiber amplifier) that could operate on a smalll amount of power (perhaps battery?) and just hang off the end of a splitter. No, they would obviously incorporate the WDFA into a 'powered splitter' (such a thing has to eexist now that I think about it).
But the trick would be to lower the number of fibers needed to tap and then hope that most of those are operating more than 3dB above their floor, and then if you have to split and optically power such a fiber.
This implies a level of prioritization even prior to reaching the 'secret So what can that Narus box do? Layer 3/4 seems obvious. Layer 7? Can it detect the presence of encryption? Can it detect the type and strength of encryption? Can it detect the existence of jpegs, mpegs, mp3s and so on? Does it support routing protocols? So, could it handle an instruction like:
If the source of the packet is located in Brooklyn

First of all, anyone have the latest word about Cryptome?
Second of all, I took a look at these and what's becomming quite clear is that they don't really say that much. They basically just show how the LGXs are connected and interface into and out of the "secret room" via splitters.* It does say that a buttload of traffic is being split and sent off to NSA equipmet, but the real missing piece is just how that traffic gets back to NSA. I still believe that they just can't send back EVERYTHING, and have to have several layers of prioritzation, so that only fairly interesting traffic makes it back in real time (this is not to say that they don't possibly route and store uninteresting local traffic for future reference) but they can't get everything back to, for instance, DC in real Another question I've had for a while is how they get around the loss budgets in certain cases. Dropping a 3dB splitter into an OC-48 signal that's pushed to the limit will result in some signficant BER degredation. Do they just avoid those signals? DO they put in some kind of in-line optical amplifier? (That's not trivial, as they have to electrically power such a device.)
*: On the other hand, the existence of splitters alone proves that this is not standard CALEA, so when the case broke this was significant. But technologically it's not all that interesting nor surprising (for 'paranoid' Cypherpunks, at least).

What is the protocol for locating and updating my identity on that server without anyone else being able to determine which identity I am accessing? Let's assume that I always initiate a session from the same IP address, and that the identity is encrypted. What I don't want is for anyone to see that "I" always access identity No. 268.

2) Many others use this service
3) One of the identities visible to the outside world is me

Of course, there needs to be a way to hide the data such that one can't tell

That's pretty interesting.
During the Variola debates concerning how much NSA could actually backhaul, I
made the point that some a lot could probably be ascertained by looking at
what NSA was funding publicly.
For example, by looking at NSA funding of burst-mode optical networking, one
could infer that NSA probably has a significant gap in terms of what they WANT
to grab and what they actually can grab and backhaul (plus, there are certain
fundamental limits to optical systems that would lead one to conclude
something similar). This, I believe, is confirmed by what was revealed about
the NSA "secret room" in AT&T's CO in the Bay Area.
Arguably, a well-done and perhaps trust-based wiki could wiggle a lot of out
what NSA is involved in, but of course there'd still be huge gaps. On the
other hand, in some areas (such as chip fabrication) I think it's getting safe
to say that NSA can't be more than one generation ahead of existing
fabrication technologies, if at all. Thus, one could make some accurate
upper-bound statements about capabilities and add that to the known funding.
Does NSA fund stuff just to avoid precisely this type of reverse engineering?
I'd bet they do, and learned to do so during the soviet era. But I also
suspect it's possible to sniff those out too.

In NYC it's common to see 9/11 conspiracy theorists, and I am always amazed.
Basically, if a conspiracy is out in the open, who gives a sh*t? Whether 9/11
was planned by Bushites or not, the result is a huge series of crimes and
political vandalism such that 9/11 is a footnote in comparison.
My thinking is that conspiracy theorists would rather believe that 'this was
all planned' rather than the incompentent and complete cluster f*ck it
actually is. They'd rather believe someone's in control and 'screwing us over'
rather than the reality of chaos.

@_subject: RE: undersea cable cuts 
No real ruminations are needed on these subjects: They're known and by no
means secret.
Regenerators are mostly gone now, both on land and undersea, replaced by the
optical fiber amplifier.
Undersea cables carry electrical power through a lining in their sheeth.
An OTDR can't see past a traditional regenerator: The fiber span is
terminated. (It also can't see past an optical fiber amplifier because of the
isolators that keep the ASE from lasing inside the amplifier.)
Tapping an optical fiber is absolutely trivial, more trivial than tapping a
(copper) cable carrying an electrical signal. This isn't inside inside
knowledge, even the guys in the trucks know it.
Tapping an undersea optical cable, however, is a completely different matter,
and it's VERY difficult, though routinely done by NSA, etc...
Undersea cables do occasionally break, but the net-quoted statistic of
approximately 12 breaks at any one time throughout the world is entirely
misleading: There are millions of route-miles spanning the Atlantic, the
Pacific and everywhere else. This means that the odds of three or four breaks
in a small area are practically zero. They are designed to be extremely
resilient, and this design choice has been quite successful. A simple anchor
(even from a large ship) is not in general going to cut a cable.

Actually, tapping terrestrial fiber optic cable is easy: a 3db splitter will
do it, though that introduces a break (which isnt a big deal: sonet/sdh rings
will recover within 50 ms, in general).
Its also fairly easy to introduce a tap that doesnt introduce a break, and
this doesnt require spookish equipment at all:its kind of a
hand-grip-looking thing that clamps onto the fiber and pulls some of the
optical signal via cladding-mode coupling.
Either of these methods introduce at least a 3db loss, which in many cases
will just be assumed by the fibers owners to be some of the usual cultprits
that cause loss, or simply a poor splice by the truck guys.
Once you introduce optical amplification, however, its eavesdrop city and you
can tap out some signal without the loss being evident to even OTDRs.
Tapping an underwater cable is far, far harder, but the NSA is known by fiber
guys to have at least two of the very expensive and very specialized subs
At Bellcore, I actually consulted on some undersea project by the defense
department, who were seeing intermittent losses on their underwater
something-or-other, which they never told us. But, it was obvious that they
were operating an OC-3 network via their own optical fibers, which I strongly
suspect sat alongside or even inside the underwater cable. They probably had
periodic stations to look for interesting chunks of traffic that they could
tap (or electronically copy) into their own network, which Ill take a wild
guess was probably ATM over OC-3, which would make sense for several reasons,
including reach, which is critical in that environment.
In this case, though, I dont think its us JbTs, just because theres too
much business at stake.
I suspect we have some new mode of fiber optic mujahadeen that are trying to
hurt or seriously fuck up money flows into the middle east, but dont quote me
on that. How did they do it? Dont know, but remember they were resourceful
enough to figure out how to turn a 727 into a very effective smart missile.

Well, those are particularly interesting questions though I haven't given a
lot of thought to yet.
One of the things to notice is that these are fairly shallow waters in
general. And while I don't believe a scuba diver went down with a hedge
clippers, my assumption had been that someone had figured out some relatively
low-tech way to do it, and is probably trying much more often than
That said, these cables are not easy to break, not even by large boat anchors:
The cost of fixing a less engineered design would rapidly make it worthwhile
to ensure they can withstand a LOT, and they can. So I think it's worthwhile
considering who has the ability to do this sans clever tactics.
I was actually surprised to hear that two cables in close proximity were
broken and considered that not a coincidence. After three the pattern was
becoming clear.

There's been lots of net speculation about maliciousness, but for me the odds
of 3/4 failures of undersea cables in such  a relatively  small area and over
such a short amount of time is extremely suspicious, particularly given how
robust such cables are. (ie, there's maybe a dozen in the whole world at any
one time, over millions of route miles).
Whether these are JbT-type terrorists is, I think, doubtful given the revenues
traveling over these things and particularly how  ineffective the cuts were.
The cuts certainly appeared to me to be attempts to get a working+protect
sides of fiber rings by people who didn't have access to that level of detail
about how the rings are deployed over the wavelength/fiber/cable pairs.

On the other hand, if and when they can provide material evidence of their
ability to take out practically any set of cables at any time, they may get a
fairly significant reaction from financial markets. Of course, there will be

I completely disagree with what is apparently the prevailing notion on this

Encrypted email is ramping upward rapidly, in the form of big business and the
need for their Excos to protect news of mergers/acquisitions/'unexpected'
losses and so on. Oh, and don't forget all of the mundane traffic including
account numbers and so on. And St May for the 'glorious' hackers: Without
their proliferation there'd be less motivation for enterprises to encrypt.
Now the real question I have is whether this helps the little guy in any way,
because the IP addresses of encrypted packets are themselves not encrypted, so
that it's easy for NSA eavesdroppers to throw away the much less interesting
enterprise traffic.
But I have little doubt that we're slowing approaching the knee in the

Last night someone vandalized the Central Office in Mayfair, London, impact 8

and even put those fake photos in front of the security cameras.
It has wiped out lots of important banking traffic in the area, and it's going

circuit packs to get the traffic moving again.
My one main contention against the anti-Crusader Muslims (such as the 9/11

all of the other options first. What they didn't seem to understand as they
flew the planes 7 years ago is that human life means a hell of a lot less in

Well, one argument I'd bet had been ridden and will continue to ride under
Obama is that there is no eavesdropping unless a human actually listens in.
In other words, given that there's a giant vacuum cleaner, the first port of
call for that traffic is almost certainly some kind of keyword processor.
Traffic of high risk probably passes through successive layers of technology
until there's a decision to actually put a human ear on it. But the telcos
probably don't need/want to know the conditions under which a human is
actually invoked, and can deniably state that they were unaware, when they
gladly ripped out a copy of the traffic, that NSA, etc...was actually going to
break a law by having a human listen in sans warrant.
As a result, it's safe to say it's still occurring, though probably not in big
fat bundles and dedicated rooms. Back in the digital domain (as opposed to the
more obvious splitting out at the optical layer), it's easily possible for the
traffic to be routed in such a way as to grant the telcos complete plausible
deniability (eg, by leveraging CALEA in clever ways, or by merely grabbing
copies of protect traffic in UPSR rings).
Of course, this raises the spectre of the (impossible) Variola Suitcase,
meaning they probably have to do a lot more pre-filtering and dropping then
they would like.

Dunno. I think this assessment is overly pessimistic and, indeed, this very
miguided attempt by FBI to pass unenforceable legislation may indicate why.
I think there may be large and possibly enormous volumes of traffic now
flowing across private-ish P2P networks, many or all of which will be
reasonably darknettish.
Of course, the crypto isn't perfect but I don't get the sense that NSA shares
a lot with FBI, but the sheer volume may be enough to worry the latter....who
knows what's mixed in that traffic? Who knows which of the files are actually
real or which are fake to cover covert transactions and whatnot.
Come to think of it, this may actually be a good scenario: Large volumes of
computationally difficult (but not intractable) encrypted traffic presenting
standard law enforcement with more than they can handle while meanwhile the
NSAs of the world with the resources jealously guarding their capabilities and
secrets, only sharing them in the most extrme of circumstances.
Seems to me a lot could be done inside those P2P networks. In fact, anything
needing very significant security could be hard-encrypted and then injected
and subsequently encrypted again with less secure methods with the rest of the
P2P traffic...this has the advantage of hiding the strength of encryption and
avoiding special notice from the outset.
In other words, "we" may not have won but the filesharers were driven there by

Well, say for instance you're in Iran or Tunisia. You want to keep up with
where protests are occuring or where the JBTs have recently been seen. BUT,
said authorities somehow obtain a list of subscribers to that Twitter feed and
go chase them down. If the tweets can somehow get routed into a TOR-ish cloud
and then pass through some service located therein, it could be made
impossible for the authorities to find where those Tweets are going.
Of course, as twitter is an American company, you could argue that in Iran
they would not be able to get ahold of a such a list. But consider it possible
(through various means) for them to obtain such a list. That list, then,
becomes veritable gold insofar as it lets the authorities know who a large
number of troublemakers are. (Of course, this could never happen in the US
where civil liberties are so highly respected.)
RSS is OK, better than nothing, but in many situations (ie, with dumbphones or
where conditions are rapidly changing), a pull model has some distinct
disadvantages to twitter's push model. Or am I missing something? Seems both
real time as well as anonymity are hard to do in this context. (I'm assuming
that if a twitfeed is sent to an RSS-iator, then authorities could see that
and then find who is subscribing to the RSS.)

Of course, there could be something fancy that 2-way anonymizes twitter
subscriptions within the TOR cloud, but I'm thinking something like that
doesn't exist. It would be challenging (and possibly unsecure) for a service
to sustainably retain the mapping between twitter subscriber and tweet feed.
(Or perhaps that isn't necessary if some subset of tweetstreams are dumped
into the cloudsomewhere and then a subscriber goes and gets the relevant ones
A cheaper version would be to hide who actively signs up for a feed in a
bigass cloud of fake subscriptions to a twitter feed. Of course, ONE of them
will be the real subscriber, but the others won't, and it may be fairly
tedious (as well as telling) for authorities within certain domains to go
through and check each subscriber.
*: Come to think of it, there are plenty of web services that log specific
tweet streams so that non-cellphone users can go get them. One could access
such a service through TOR but then the push capability of tweets and text
messages is lost, and also it may be hard to go through TOR with many
(cheaper) mobile devices.

On the whole iPhone thing, you already knew you were being tracked by your

@_subject: New Yorker article: Enemy of the State 
Anyone read this?
I'd say it verified much of what was discussed on this list some years back,
about the likely approach by NSA to get "all" the traffic.
Of course, getting "all" the traffic would have required building a 1-for-1
fiber optic network, which I think we agreed was beyond even the nearly
infinite budget of NSA. Instead, they had to push the trafffic through
successive prioritization gates, throwing away a bunch at the edges, and the
sending the higher priority stuff through to the beltway. It would appear from
the article that the original approach had machines tagging likely traffic
needing human review, and that they originally intended to obtain a
(perfunctory) warrant for traffic both ends of which belonged to US residents.
But they apparently dispensed with the warrant formality and instead sent high
priority trafffic direct to immediate review, and stored the rest of it.
None of this, of course, is a surpise. We figured it out from fairly
straightforward principals. But what Wikileaks has shown us is that the main
problem with transparency is that it makes obvious their pathetic and
incompetent mangement, and it makes obvious their strong desire to obfuscate
their incompetence. Indeed, the persecution of the whistleblower is (at least
from the perspective of the article) not so much a punishment for revealing
state secrets (which were pretty obviously illegal), but instead revenge for
exposing the unneccessary cowboy management of the NSA during the post-9/11

@_subject: Summary of where we are right now 
Since I haven't seen anything come off of the list for a while and since I've
imbibed some nice single-malt, I will for the fuck of it summarize where
things are. Any Cypherpunk with some kinda balls will tell me I'm completely
and absolutely full of shit, but at least I tried, so do better.
1. We won. With Bitcoin and Silk Road along with encrypted peer-to-peer
sharing networks (oh yeah and TOR), it's pretty clear we won. There's a lotta
popular literature out there now discovering Cypherpunks anew. Some form of
Crypto is out there, for those that want to use it, that can can make it real
pain in the ass for TLAs to discover that your "Afghan" is really just a form
of 80s retro-pot.
2. No, we didn't win yet: TOR is a honeypot. That's right, motherfucker: You
do know who really gave TOR its initial impetus, right? And you know why they
did that? They did it precisely because it was too obvious and too expensive
to pull EVERYTHING back to Virginia or wherever. So they figured it was easier
to just get suckers to use some form of encryption (including and specifically
TOR) to send the red flag that someone wanted to hide something, so "look over
here!". Anything TOR'd is certainly backhauled to the greater DC area and, if
there are any additional meta-meta-data risk flags, they'll red light it to
begin cracking. If they can't crack within reasonable time/cost budgets (given
the risk), and if they for some reason feel a little nervous about you, well
they'll just find out where you are and attack your shitty machine. Oh, you
use Linux? Well that's totally different. It's not like they hired any
brilliant math or crypto geek coming out of college or grad school.
3. But we are going to win. Yeah, we're gonna win. Why? Because we want to.
It's not enough to encrypt: The type and context of encryption had to be
hidden as well. Kind of the network version of Rubberhose. But these young
kids who grew up not watching TV because it didn't interact with them, it's
they who will create a stego virus to propagate fake stego everywhere on
Facebook or whatever. It's them who are going to create TOR services that
operate ubiquitously behind the scenes, so that most users dob't even know
they are using it. Hiding the form of encryption will itself be the final
frontier as crypto becomes ubiquitous.
4. Bitcoin, motherfucker. Crazy old cackling May was right. Or at least, he
was right enough. Right enough for me to buy pot or 'cid or shrooms over the
internet and have them sent to my Unabomber shack. Even
less...tasteful...forms of porn will be tolerated precisely because THEY can't
reveal what they can do, at least not unless their own salaries are in
jeopardy. Adrian Lamo? No doubt THEY looked for someone who had contact
Manning so that they could hide what they had intercepted and what they could
do. But they will keep hiding what they can do while a real economy takes over
and sorts out its own.
Yeah, that's it. It's downhill from here. Cypherpunks are dead because they
are no longer needed, so long live the King of the Anarchy.
