Name:Elisabeth Triouh
Abidjan Ivory Coast, West Africa
I am Elisabeth Trinouh from Liberia currently living in exile in Abidjan capital of Ivory Coast. I am the daughter of Mr. Christopher Trinouh who was Director in the Liberian Ministry of Defence before he was assassinated in ambush from peace meeting with the Rebels. My mother had died earlier in 2001 of kidney related diseases. My brother Richard and I become orphans without anybody to care for us, because President Charles Taylors Government failed to take care of us as promised. My father was entrusted with the responsibility of sourcing for Arms and Ammunition for the Liberian Government as the Country was under severe United Nation Arm and Travel embargo at that time due to my countrys illicit dealings in blood diamond and instigating conflicts in West Africa. My father unsure of Liberia Political future had secretly moved the sum of Ten Million USA Dollars [$10.Million] out of Liberia and deposited it security and Finance company in our neighbouring Country of Ivory Coast.
The company management does not know the real contents of the consignment because my father with assistance of junior staff of the company declared the consignment as personal effect and family valuables. That was at the period when Liberia was facing United Nation Embargoes. We left Monrovia to live in Abidjan, Ivory Coast as political refugees In August 2003 when the President; Mr. Charles Taylor was forced into exile
It was unfortunate that the Government that our father served and lost his life did not make any arrangement to cover us in their plan to move to exile. So because of the Rebels coming into Monrovia, we have no alternative than to escape as they may kill us as they killed our father. I hereby request you to assist us by acting as our late father's foreign business partner so that you will help us to move the money from the security company here to your country for investment purposes. You will also help us to migrate to your country to continue our lives as orphans and with your guidance; the money will be invested in profitable ventures.
Kindly inform me what percentage of the total sum you wish to receive as compensation for rendering your help. You should please treat this matter as confidential, as I would not like to expose the existence of the money at the security company for security reasons ranging from our refugee status here and our father's status as civil servant back home in Liberia.Kindly study my request carefully and send your response to the above email addresses.
Thanks in advance for saving our lives.
Yours Sincerely,
Elisabeth & Richard Triouh.
