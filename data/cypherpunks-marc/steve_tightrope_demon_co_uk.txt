It was in decline for years before it was taken over by Murdoch and
the circulation has increased greatly under his ownership.
Murdoch revitalised the entire UK newspaper industry by destroying the
stranglehold of the print unions who had prevented the production of
The Times for several months in the late 1970s.
Print unions also at this time had censored newspapers by refusing to
print articles they didn't like.
The Times behaved poorly in this matter but I don't think it is an
instrument of government propaganda.  Not in the sense the BBC is.

It's the same people.  The former quartermaster of PIRA Mickey McKevitt is currently the RIRA
PIRA also has had a history of fake and hoax warnings as well as a
lack of central control of their "Active Service Units".
"Most Real IRA members are former IRA" and "suspected of receiving
funds from sympathizers in the United States."

What you mean by the IRA is probably the Provisional IRA.
The Official IRA (Marxist and known as the "stickies") itself has been
defunct since the early 1970s and PIRA was formed by hardliners
leaving OIRA.
The Real IRA has been formed by hardliners leaving PIRA.
If history repeats itself then most people will probably end up
refering to RIRA as IRA anyway, since the distinction between these
organisations will probably be of little interest to the family of
someone killed.
(There are another republician terrorist groups such as the INLA as well)

29 people were killed in an real IRA bombing in Omagh in 1998. This
was a shopping High Street full of people.
The warning given was incorrect and _increased_ the number of deaths
because the terrorists said, probably on purpose, the wrong end of the
street and the people were moved towards the bomb.

@_subject: al-Qa'ida Laptop Encryption 
How they cracked the terrorists' code
Getting to the heart of the documents contained in the al-Qa'ida
computer - bought by chance by the Wall Street Journal's reporter in
Kabul - meant cracking the encryption of Microsoft's Windows 2000
operating system installed on the machine, which had been used to
protect the data.
That is not a trivial task. Microsoft will only say that if you lose
the password that controls entry to a Windows 2000 system, your best
option is to remember it - or simply to wipe the machine and start
again. And its Encrypting File System (EFS), which had been used to
encode the files, is just as strong.
But the files were too valuable for that. Instead, the team embarked
on the task of breaking through the encryption, which jumbles the
contents of the files so that even someone reading the individual
bytes of data stored on the actual hard disk (rather than trying to
access them through the operating system, which had locked them out)
would simply find rubbish.
Cracking the encryption meant finding the digital "key" that had
previously been used to unlock it. That was not stored in any readable
file on the machine, for it was itself encrypted.
The only way to reproduce it was to generate the key from first
principles: by trying various combinations of random bits and trying
to decrypt the file with them, and seeing if it produced sense - or
Luckily, the PC had a version of Windows 2000 with an "export-quality"
key - only 40-bits long, rather than the "US" quality, which being
128-bits long would have been billions of times harder to crack.
Even so, it took the equivalent of a set of supercomputers running for
five days, 24 hours a day, to find the key. But find it they did.
The irony that the terrorists used a product made by one of the US's
biggest corporations to protect plans it was making against it may not
be lost on an administration that recently relaxed rules on the export
of "strong" encryption. Tighter controls may follow.

What's wrong with loopback FS and in what sense is it a kludge?  If you don't like it then put your code where your mouth is by writing
and submitting patches to OpenBSD to add your own "real" encryption.
If you can't do this then you are unqualified to attack work others
have put in for free as well as being naive in trusting closed source
crypto from the likes of Microsoft.
You are also wrong about linux encryption which has been in SuSE
release since 7.2 (they are up to 7.3 now).

In which case it is trying to make a political point which isn't
supported by most of the research which has been done in this area.
Even Duncan Campbell accepts that basic effective civil defence would
save large numbers of people in time of nuclear war.
When I saw "War Games" I thought it was extremely dated (its black and
white and 37 years old) and a pretty poor film.
I think that it owns its fame solely to the fact the BBC didn't
transmit it in 1965 (it was "banned") and that had it been shown at
the time it would now be forgotten

@_subject: Re: Palm Pilot Handshake 
I think you mean public key based authentication.
I doubt memory is likely to be an issue with this since decade old DOS
handhelds ran PGP 2.x fine and if you google for "palm pilot crypto" you
will find 2000 vintage ports of OpenPGP and OpenSSL.
The Palms do have fairly slow processors so checking keys may take a while
and generating them probably quite a long time.  More modern PDAs such as
the Zaurus or iPaq have processors which are an order of magnitude faster
and run linux so PGP (or GPG or whatever) should work.  Also the new
generation of mobiles which run Java are probably the future once the
standards settle down and the phones become more reliable.
I can see little point in trying to use shorter keys which would be a very
broken solution to a probably non-existent problem.  People should be using
longer keys rather than shorter ones, since most of the news about short key
lengths isn't good (google "DJB RSA").
It's more a software issue than a hardware issue.  It's not much of a
software problem since RSA can be written in a few lines of code.  If you
have a high level language running on (or compiler) for the hardware then
you can easily port open source crypto.  This is probably a safer solution
from a security aspect than relying on potentially backdoored or legally
restricted chipsets.
Suitable hardware has been available for 10 years or longer with a lot of
publicity for the Java ring  and iButtons about 5 years back.
It's possible the US Govt. uses iButtoms but I would very much doubt it's
used much in production.
State agencies tend to be *very* conservative with authentication and rely
on physical identity cards, individually issued (and revocable) PIN numbers
and the like.
They are run by grey men rather than techno-fetishist computer geeks.

In the UK at least railway stations tend to have been built in the ugly

Also railways stations and the associated cheap hotels with a large
transient population tend to attract undesirables such as drug dealers,
muggers and hookers and the sort of thing which pushs the value of your
house down and nice middle class people don't want on their doorstep.
The people in richer areas tend to have more political clout and more

What to call people who write software is problematic.
"software engineer" is a job title like "programmer" or "developer" (often with senior or junior as a prefix).  Senior meaning that you get paid a little more since you have more experience rather than being a manager. I never had a programming job where the language was specified in the title.  I am talking here of permanent work rather than contract Searching on jobserve (the main UK IT job site) I get
3123 hits for developer
2009 engineer
806 software developer
803 software engineer
766 programmer
201 software programmer
So programmer is the unpopular job title not engineer, probably because it seems to have a bit of an outdated 1970s punched and magnetic tape type reputation.
Any Americans care to comment on this?
I think people can still get a good education even in unstable and poorer nations.  You don't need to spend many dollars to run Linux and print out downloaded PDFs. There were campus deaths in the American and French student riots of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Oxford and Cambridge Universities openly sell masters degrees.
The examinations systems in many British influenced countries in the east resemble 1950s UK ones in their high standards and there doesn't seem to be much doubt that British examinations have been dumbed down since the 1980s to improve pass percentages.  It doesn't seem to me likely a doctor's son in Bangalore is automatically going to get a worse education than the average street kid in South Central LA or Hackney.
The Asperger enhanced asian engineering, physics and maths geeks shut in their rooms with an internet link won't be the ones running around killing people.  They are more likely to be hacking NASA via abuse of their local inband trunk signaling and gaining an excellent education in C buffers, UNIX and international telecommunications systems.  And hopefully subscribing to this list and reading Murray Rothbard.
Agreed.  They will get a bigger slice of a bigger pie but still a smaller serving than the US.
I remember the Americans being scared about the "Japanese Are Coming With Their Expert Systems" hype of the early 1980s.  And they never came despite many yen being wasted by MITI.  The only currently popular Japanese computer language Ruby is pretty much a copy of a European one

The UK tends to follow US fashions very closely importing in titles like CEO and CTO and the term "software engineer" is no different.
As for your comments that "my impression is that India has a few excellent institutions and a vast number of unbelievably bad schools" I suspect this is true but applies equally to the UK and USA and indeed any country with a university system.  Neither is graduating from a top engineering school such as Stanford any automatic guarantee of quality as anyone who has worked with these people knows.
India has an excellent tradition in mathematics and some of the best software engineers I have worked with in the UK have been Indian graduates, since it's the most enterprising and highly qualified ones which tend to emigrate.
