Hi, I'm a reporter with a newspaper in Thousand Oaks, California. I was wondering whether anyone knew how to get in touch with "SeaChelle," who posted on here a year ago claiming to know the secret of the BeOutdoors.com spam.

Hi, this is John Gorenfeld, reporter from the Thousand Oaks Weekly Acorn. I read your post about BeOutdoors.com and spam e-mail. Since Hoffman is running for office, it was interesting to read he was allegedly a spammer. Can you tell me more about this?
