@_subject: DoS of spam blackhole lists 
Considering that it appears that spammers are now resorting
to DoS'ing sites that host spam lists, wouldn't now be a good
time to investigate the possibilities of a distributed, or at
least, load balanced blacklist provider?
Even something as simple as round-robin DNS with sufficient
nodes (couple of hundred?) should be enough to make such
attacks highly inefficient and far, far less likely to be
Of course, with round robin DNS, one can target the DNS
Would this make for an interesting community project?
Any comments appreciated.

I fail to see how the above is at all necessary in responding
to the statement.
Either a) an explanation, or b) a link to an explanation as to why you have these opinions would have been far more useful than the above troll.
Procmail serves no purpose by itself. It requires no small
amount of effort on the part of the administrator to utilise
for any type of systems implmentation, and thus administrators with limited time (common in smaller companies) will rather rely on (flawed) projects than self-initiated implementations.
The above is useful information. Specifically, the recognition
of duplicate mail receipts is a concept that is new to me, though
that would require that both email addresses would receive an
equal amount of 'publicity' on newsgroups, mailing lists, etc
in order that they are both acquired by a potential spammer.
The latter idea I have heard before. If you have a preferred
implementation however, which one it is and why is information
that I would find useful.

If one of the addresses was not ever used for legitimate purposes,
then blocking all addresses that sent to this address should be an
effective filter.
Also, with the low cost of storage today, storing message hashes
of known spam wouldn't take much space (not to say that this would
be a good way of identifying spam).
I was pondering recently the usage of a "web of trust"-type system
whereby one could use communal whitelists with decreasing trust
going outward as well as the opportunity to selected trusted
sources - perhaps using authentication authorities for PK's
as authoratitive whitelists, or not, as per ones choice. (Since
PK's require identification for the issue of certs, it at least
provides some chain of evidence. However, this negates the opportunity
for anonymity). How feasible are implementations of such 'distributed' whitelists?
(I'm assuming that entries from non-whitelist identified emails
are permitted to send through on a challenge-response basis,
and that once identified, users have the opportunity to add to
such whitelist).
And, is it possible to indentify a bit of information as coming
from a trusted source, without identifying that trusted source
and without resorting to the use of a TTP?

Freedom means what to you? Getting to vote once every four
or five years on what direction your country is going to
What if freedom means an anarchive un-state?
Being forced to subjugate your views to those of others on the basis of your geographical locality, while being prevented from gathering with others who may share your political views in sufficient numbers such as to be able to succesfully secede is not freedom.
What is development? Market liberalisation? Socialism?
Statism or the removal of the state aparatus? In statist, capitalist democracy, reduce or increase taxes? Remove or increase social welfare and support?
Permit or restrict immigration?
If you are sold on blanket, unqualified terms such as
'freedom', 'development' and 'democracy', and are willing
to accept the empty rhetoric espoused by most politicians
without critical analysis, then you'd probably make a good
subject of the current system. Or am I wrong?

@_subject: First quantum crypto bank transfer 
Cryptography system goes underground (Aug 19)
     A group of scientists in Austria and Germany has installed an optical
   fibre quantum cryptography system under the streets of Vienna and
   it to perform the first quantum secure bank wire transfer (A Poppe et
   al. 2004 Optics Express 12 3865). The quantum cryptography system
   consisted of a transmitter (Alice) at Vienna's City Hall and a
   (Bob) at the headquarters of an Austrian bank. The sites were linked
   1.45 kilometres of single-mode optical fibre.
