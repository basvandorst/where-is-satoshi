============================== START ==============================
Hello everyone,
Sorry if this message is for you a repost.  However, here I had some problems
to receive messages from SAS-L.
I'm using PROC REG with several REWEIGHT statements.  I obtain a lot of
predicted values, and i'd like to see the regression fit of my data.
I know that PROC GPLOT can produce regression line, however i would
like to be able to produce an OVERLAY of two plots (one with predicted
values, the other just a scatter plot of original obs.), but where my
predicted values are joined.  In SAS's manuals, if a use severals
SYMBOL statement, i'm supposed to be able to specify different
specifications to different plot.  However, it doesn't work in
the following example:
SYMBOL1 INTERPOL=JOIN;
SYMBOL2 INTERPOL=NONE;
PROC GPLOT DATA=mydata;
  PLOT predict * var1 = 1   myobs * var1 = 2  / OVERLAY ;
  FILENAME gsasfile 'graph.ps';
  GOPTIONS DEVICE=ps GACCESS=gsasfile;
What i want is the following: i want points joined for 'predict * var1',
and an usual scatter plot for 'myobs * var1'.
However, when i print my postscript file 'graph.ps', two cases occured:
a) nothing... or b) the points in the two plots are joined.
Can you help me?
Thank you very much!
