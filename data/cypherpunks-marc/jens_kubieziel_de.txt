Our local hackerspace uses a rather neutral address:
We could also host the Cypherpunks list, if you like. However here is no
Majordomo running (and probably never will be). As far as I see it the
list doesn't use the distributed feature, so switching to Mailman should
not be a hard problem.
If you like a more on topic domain I could setup a mailing list at
anonymitaet-im-inter.net. ;) This is german for ;anonymity on the
internet+. The site hosts at the moment only a Mixmaster node.
