Ignore how the socialist-fascist-MIC despises the NRA, OK? I doubt that such criticism would be leveled at the "approved" liberal
causes that adopt the identical practices or even the more unethical
ones for far more draconian purposes than the NRA's defence of the law.
You want something done politically? don't turn up your nose at what
works. do what your enemy does and do it better. Or stay home and
complain and do nothing and stay out of the way.
