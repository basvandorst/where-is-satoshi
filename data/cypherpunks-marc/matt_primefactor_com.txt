The only limitation is that of time.  Your entitlement will expire at some point at which you can renew it or let it go.
The entitlements can be applied to anything.  They aren't locked at a certain revision.  If the next version of Red Hat comes out then you can install it, register it with RHN, and then on the RHN web site remove the entitlement from the old machine and assign it to the new one.
