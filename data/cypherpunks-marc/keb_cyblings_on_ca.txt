@_subject: Re: German data rentention law 
The data retention law seems to be partly an attempt to make private operators do the government's work of law enforcement.
However, suppose the technical implementation is something like requiring ISPs to allow wholesale teeing of the pipes as is now done at AT&T in the USA,
at government/taxpayer expense.
Then we will not know whether some or all of the data is logged.
Further, what prevents European (or Chinese etc) data spies from cooperating
with American data spies, enabling monitoring both ends of most connections?

This is really not the place for a political argument.
If it were, i would be pointing out that aquiescence to
any existing regime *is* taking a political stance.
However, as noted on the Who Uses Tor page,
Tor is useful to people from all ends of the spectrum
including dissidents and governments.
Therefore it is not necessary to debate motives or politics
but rather to educate everyone about it
and further its development.

@_subject: Re: Kaspersky wants to make Tor illegal and supports a globalized 
I havent read Kaspersky's report but the general argument is supportable.
The hardware on which the high speed internet runs is increasingly concentrated
under fewer owners.  How many internet access providers exist where you live
and do they significantly differ in Terms of Service, i.e. friendly to privacy?
Google alone now carries from 6 to 10% of all the traffic.
viz. The laws governing (or attempting to) what is allowed on the internet
are also swinging in favour of more control and traceability.  Indeed, if the ACTA currently being negotiated is implemented,
Tor could well become illegal, (a) because it can be used to circumvent
restriction of copyrighted content by country and (b) because you can use it
to hide identity while filesharing (even though we discourage that).
EFF and friends succeeded in repealing some PATRIOT act insanity,
but national insecurity and corporate greed continue to infect
all areas of law and social reality including the internet.
Anyway, there is a volunteer project which may help Tor work on the kind of grassroots internet you describe:

How are bitcoins relevant to Tor?
Can a relay generate them just by processing traffic?

This incident might make a good press release or blog post, to
highlight both that Tor wasnt cracked and that law enforcement
has sufficient means to catch illegal drug dealers using Tor.

Why are anonymous signups assumed guilty of abuse before anything happens?  How about limiting usage initially, with progressive raising of limits based on time elapsed with non-abusive behaviour (something like credit card limits)?  People should be able to establish good *online* reputations that are not tied to their physical identity.

If the FBI had to use a subpoena it means the VPN provider wasnt
cooperating, but was forced by legal means to hand over the info.
It would be unrealistic to expect any provider in any country to destroy
subscriber info after they had received a notice from a judge ordering
it to be turned over to police.  At least in some countries a court
order is required.
Much better in the long run for Tor and other anonymity services to get
governments to pass laws limiting data retention.  That way the provider
wouldnt have the info to hand over.

This persecution has been going on for decades.  I am surprised you have
not heard about the "intellectual property" protection racket that is
implemented in international treaties and corresponding national laws...
Tor cannot win such a war with technical means - almost all ISPs fold
under pressure and shut down relays that offend the monopoly holders.
