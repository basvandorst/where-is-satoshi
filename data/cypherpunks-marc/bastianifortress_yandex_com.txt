Hey all! Just a simple question out of curiosity; i see pgp signed mails going round in the mailing list, but where do you keep your public keys, and how am i supposed to get them? Does the mailing list have its own keybase, or do you just sign your messages to look cool :)(Also, here, have a cookie:

@_subject: PascalCoin? 
Someone posted in metzdowd mailing list about a new PascalCoin, with the claim that it does not need to keep transaction history to prevent double spending. Didn't read the full white paper yet, but it looks a little undetailed and absract at a first glance. Anybody checked it yet? Also the paper apologizes in advance for possible mistranslations from its catalan language original copy :)-- Youâre not from the Castle, youâre not from the village, you are nothing.

Wow... Article says they did a similar thing by altering fan speed before. These guys are sure obsessed with data extraction.

@_subject: [OT] Bios Level USB Stick Protection 
Hey all, this will be a personal question for anyone up for a brainstorm. I work at a defense industry firm (well i'm not proud of it, let's not get to that) which is VERY strict on data protection policies. I don't have internet connection, am not admin at my own computer and probably computer is protected against usb sticks (probably at os level, though, i know my usb mouse and keyboard works). I started writing a game while i'm slacking, and will probably have an urge to pull it at a point :D Planning to sneak in a linux live usb stick (bios is not locked, i checked it), and pull out the network cable not to leave any linux signature on the intranet server. Do you know of any tool i might not be aware of, that might jeopardize me? -- Youâre not from the Castle, youâre not from the village, you are nothing.

In such discussions with people, i always claim cooperation and empathy is just as human nature as selfishness, as a pro-socialist argument, but deep down inside, i can't say i have much hope either.-- Youâre not from the Castle, youâre not from the village, you are nothing.
