Perhaps this is precisely how it works.  Accumulate as much input as you can
still have a permutation.  Output the number of elements in the permutation
the number of the permutation.  Continue with the rest of the input.  The
hard part
would be finding an efficient way to calculate the number of the permutation
1 and n!) and (for decompression) producing the permutation from the number.
