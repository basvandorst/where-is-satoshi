George Danezis has looked at using sparse expander graphs for mix networks [1]: each node has a small number of neighbours but can reach any other node in a small number of hops, so if the circuit is long enough the entry node can't narrow down the list of possible exit nodes or vice versa. Unlike Tor, the small number of neighbours per node makes it possible to provide cover traffic.
It's not clear whether social networks are good expanders [2][3], but Shishir Nagaraja has looked at using social networks for mix networks [4]; the LiveJournal social network appears to be suitable, although you have to use more cover traffic than you would in an ideal expander graph.
