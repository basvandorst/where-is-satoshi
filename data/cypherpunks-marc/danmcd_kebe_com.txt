That very statement prompted me to start the Suite B thread a couple of days ago.
What concerns me most about ECC is that your choices seem to be the IEEE Standard curves (which have NSA input, IIRC), or ones that will bring down the wrath of Certicom (Slogan:  "We're RSA Inc. for the 21st Century!").
I've said this repeatedly over the past year, but if whomever ends up buying Certicom-owner Blackberry would set them free, it would help humanity (at the cost of the patent revenues, alas).

*LINUX* /dev/random is not robust, so claims the paper.
I wonder how various *BSDs or the Solarish family (Illumos, Oracle Solaris)
hold up under similar scrutiny?
Linux is big, but it is not everything.

Security shouldn't be an industry -- it should be a lifestyle.  (Just like
performance.)  The "suits" you mention are those who see security as an
income supplement income, not as something to be thought of at product design
Perry and other will remember the IPsec KM wars.  One of the participants had
an ENTIRE GROUP in a large company devoted to security-as-product behind
them.  It's really hard to fight that much momentum when, say, you're trying
to build it in properly to the OS.
If RSA goes down in flames, I only hope it helps kill the security-as-extra
