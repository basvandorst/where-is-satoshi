It is interesting to see a team of researchers asking this question in
public. Developers usually have their own preferences about this already.
If you think about language security you may want to think about these things
- Any garbage collection will introduce pauses to your program. The length of
these pauses will increase if the memory usage increases. This can easily
become a problem if your program requires either a lot of memory or real time
response. Traffic analysis resistance sounds like it requires both lots of
buffering and real time response (extra latency could effect traffic
- Languages with a high layer of abstraction make lots of things easier. But
often these are things you should be careful with. For example string
operations: If you use them for data exchange, you can easily mess up when
escaping them (e.g. sql injection). Also, they are larger and slower to
manipulate than binary data.
- How the code gets is written makes a huge difference. Is your team paranoid
enough (in your case you need a *lot* of paranoia)? Do they care enough? Does
everybody know what they are doing? Does your organisation put security or
business first?
I do not think that the C toolchain is easy to audit either. I would just
focus on something which is open source and in wide use. In this case,
somebody who has a backdoor in the runtime or toolchain probably has a
backdoor to the system either way.
