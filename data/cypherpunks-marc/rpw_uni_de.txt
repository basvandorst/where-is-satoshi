Does anyone know why the CDC does not recommend using nasal swab specimens
for testing ? Is that because you can only reliably detect inhalational
anthrax that way or is there any other reason ?

I prefer the Keyring for PalmOS (
Comes with source code, uses 3DES for encryption (the passphrase is
MD5 hashed as far as i remember). Have a look at it.

40-bit DES in ECB mode sounds even more great. It's them

Yeah, that announcement just ran over the slashdot ticker. Someone posted the
following insightful link subsequently:
Looks like that sucker only does key-truncated version of DES called DES-40.
Right... did they say weeks? I'd say minutes, unless ABIT means [insert some
impoverished 3rd world country] government supercomputers.
It's snakeoil, move on, nothing to see here.

Note to author of code: Look into the "Scan User Flash Area" option if
you ever have to pull this trick on a motherboard with an Intel BIOS.
See [1] for instructions on how one might make use of it. Additional exercise: Enable "Scan User Flash Area" regardless of user setting.

So what? The code hooks into the bootstrap phase of the BIOS, decompresses some
unspecified stuff (I have not verified whether it actually *CAN* successfully
decompress anything and what algorithm it uses; just skimmed the code to see
whether it tries something really spiffy) and executes the injected code at the
end of the BIOS bootstrap.
This is *NOT* the interesting part. The interesting part is the payload it is
to deliver. The claim "This enables the software to spy on the user and remain
hidden to the operating system." rather interests me. How do they achieve this
in an OS-agnostic fashion?
I know this may be passing premature judgement, but to be honest I think the
code looks pretty amateurish and has at most beta quality. Most Romanian virus
writers should be able to come up with something better in less than a day.
Give them a week and they have something that works on a *MUCH* wider range
of hardware than just two types of mobos/machines.
Thanks for the demonstration though. Does this agency seriously think we
believe they might be using the above mentioned code in a "production
environment" some day? Tsk tsk tsk...

Look at the PadLock ACE programming guide [1]. Only seems to support Rijndael
with a block size of 128 bits (= AES); it allows both key scheduling in
hardware and in software, the latter allowing you to have your own custom
key schedule. It also allows you to increase the number of rounds if you
think Rijndael-128's security margins are too low. Props to the VIA engineers
for both the customizability. The errate are funny as well. Looks like the
current stepping has a bug in the key schedule for 192 and 256 bit keys.
