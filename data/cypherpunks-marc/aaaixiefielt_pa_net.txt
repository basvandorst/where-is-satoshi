Reasons to conside MOGI:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on reserves potentia|ly worth mu|ti-mi|lions, MOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the value of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and developers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple returns.
