There is a paper on discovering vulnerabilities in open source and proprietary
software you might find interesting:
Härtig, Hermann, Claude-Joachim Hamann, and Michael Roitzsch. "The Mathematics
of Obscurity: On the Trustworthiness of Open Source." Workshop on the Economics
of Information Security 2010.
Kind regards

I'm sorry if I provided outdated information. Anyway I think that Microsoft
still uses CTLs in order to update the trust store. For the reference see for
example  or
CTLs can be downloaded using any browser on these URLs:
Unfortunatelly, the CTL does not contain entire certificate only its hash, but
using the link provided you can download the certificates.
If you have a Windows machine with certutil you can parse and download the CTL
with a simple powershell script:
certutil -dump .\authroot.stl | findstr "Identifier:" | ForEach-Object -Process {
-OutFile "$caCertSKI.crt"}

This might help  also check
for recent version of the CTL.
