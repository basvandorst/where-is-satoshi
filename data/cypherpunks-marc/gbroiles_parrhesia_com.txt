Oh, it goes far beyond that - it creates a system where, upon a governor's declaration of a public health emergency, the public health authorities get control of all food, guns, medicine, fuel, clothing, medical facilities, doctors, and human beings within the affected area - they're entitled to immediate possession of   whatever useful private property they want, which can be redistributed, held, or destroyed as they see fit - and they're empowered to use public safety agencies to force doctors perform examinations, tests or vaccinate/immunize similarly uncooperative individuals, and to create quarantine or exclusion areas as they consider It's pretty much a police state implementation act.

Bullshit. There's no real-time on-line database of ordinary citizen fingerprints available to match versus ID cards, even if the cards (which don't exist and haven't been issued) were available.
Thumbprints taken in banks don't do anything to immediately ID the person cashing a check - they provide evidence about who got the money, if the check turns out to have been fraudulent or stolen .. but to be worth much, the fingerprint needs to be matched to a name (which is only possible if that finger of that person has been fingerprinted and archived before, and they're both good, readable prints), or to a physical body, which might happen after an arrest.
They're evidence which is useful in court, but they don't do a thing to tell the bank whether or not the transaction is likely to fail.
So, yeah, sure, thumbprints would let us know if the dead suicide bomber's "real name" was really the one he used to rent the truck or buy the plane ticket .. or if he just got started on his project early enough to get his stolen identity matched to his real fingerprint .. but how, exactly, is that going to Save the Children?
I agree that it will help law enforcement agents make a nice crisp presentation in Congressional hearings about how they dug up the suicide bomber's Permanent Record all the way back to preschool less than 45 minutes after they turned a daycare center into a slaughterhouse .. but I don't really give a shit about that.
The only way you can use fingerprints and ID cards to begin to prevent the killing in the first place looks like this:
1.      Reliably fingerprint everyone on the planet and record their "true name", whatever that is, and issue ID cards to them with that data.
2.      Cross-reference the data in (1) with existing criminal, intelligence, mental health data, making sure that in the process of doing that you don't screw up people's right to privacy in medical records, reveal existing investigations, or reveal intelligence sources/methods.
3.      Distribute cheap and reliable fingerprint readers all over the planet (or maybe all over the US, though it's hard for me to imagine other countries will cooperate with (1) unless they get them too) so that people's fingerprints can be imaged locally.
4.      Build a real-time database capable of storing & retrieving the data from (1) and (2) given fuzzy images from (3), and a network capable of providing simultaneous access for millions of clients.
5.      Give access to (4) to everyone who needs it, but prevent them from using the data they gather (like fingerprint images and personal data) for ID theft or impersonation.
6.      Develop either an algorithm/expert system which decides which people ID'd within the system are allowed to do certain things (like "board a plane", "buy av gas", "rent a truck", etc), or delegate that decision to many thousands of minimum-wage clerks, who will not be susceptible to trickery nor bribes.
Can you get that up and running in, say, 60 days?
California has been trying for years to get a vastly less ambitious system working even a little bit at the Department of Motor Vehicles - at one point (several years in) they figured out that they had to throw away everything they'd done so far and start all over again. A project like you propose in your casual, offhand manner is probably 100 times more expensive and more complicated that California's .. but that doesn't seem to scare you. The IRS's computer system is in similar disarray - they can't always find records or correlate things, and they've gone ahead and assigned everyone nice easy numbers, and they operate on a timeframe of months and years, not seconds ticking by at a departure gate or a gas station pump. The FBI tried to build a database of disqualified firearm purchasers for use in the "instant check" process and it's proved to have an error rate of between 5 and 10%.
If the CA DMV, the IRS, and the FBI can't get these sorts of databases up and running given their already generous budgets (millions and billions) and timeframes measured in years, how can you possibly think that anything like this is even possible - even before reaching the "is it a good idea?" Hmm. Then it's funny that Mohammed Atta (likely the worst-looking on paper, since he's the guy who was meeting with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague and had outstanding criminal/traffic warrants) was able to clear Customs when he re-entered the country.
The "ID card" fairy tale still loses.
Further, your "perfection isn't necessary" argument would be reasonable if we weren't talking about trying to solve a terrorist problem - but it's my impression that's the context of this discussion. The interesting thing about terrorism is that its direct effects aren't especially important - it's the secondary effects on people not physically affected by the event which give terrorism its power. Losing 5000 people in one day to an identifiable cause - or the 3 or 4 that we've lost to anthrax - is absolutely nothing, statistically speaking. Red meat and cigarettes probably kill a WTC's worth of people every day in the US alone - and we probably lose an anthrax letter's worth of deaths every day to even more obscure stuff like bee stings or wading pools.
Those events are powerful not because of the people killed and property damaged, but because of the fear that the other 230 million people in the US feel (+ more worldwide), because they're faced with the possibility of successful, similar attacks - and that's why a mealy-mouthed "my security system isn't perfect but it'll reduce the marginal success rate and that's still valuable" doesn't even come close to solving the problem, because people are already freaked out about a statistically insignificant risk. Reducing that infinitesimal risk further without eliminating it is a waste of time.
(Accordingly, some measures do nothing to reduce the actual risk but make people feel better because of their superstitious beliefs about the power of guns or databases or the application of arbitrary screening and sorting rules. The placebo effect created by these measures isn't unimportant - but let's create it by more traditional and less risky means, like prayer and faith in supreme beings and/or ritual pledges of allegiance or other ceremonies, instead of wasting lots of time and money creating unstable oppression systems ripe for misuse or takeover.)

@_subject: Re: Security-by-credential or security-by-inspection 
It's popular to frame this as a "this or that" question - like we've got a choice between terrorism (or insecurity) and security without privacy, and it's time for some group of people to deliberate carefully about the right choice to make, or the right way to balance mutually exclusive options.
There is no such choice - the is no other side to bargain with, who will accept our privacy or autonomy or liberty in exchange for guaranteed safety.
We can't build any sort of reliable security infrastructure on top of our existing identity scheme. Our current scheme doesn't provide for one-to-one mappings between people and identities, it doesn't provide for reliable ways to validate a proposed match between a meat body and an identity, and it provides a multitude of informal and traditional ways to adopt additional or alternate identities in a perfectly legitimate and orderly way.
There's simply no way to enforce or implement an "identity" system meant to track humans if all of the elements of the system are pure information, because people who want to defeat the system will report misleading or incomplete information.
It's also wildly impractical to even think of issuing some sort of physical token to the *billions* of people on Earth - people cannot (and will not) preserve them against loss, theft, damage, and so forth - nor can they be trusted not to falsely report loss or theft, or to sign up for multiple identities. Tokens which become associated with negative histories will be "lost" immediately; and tokens associated with positive histories will be targets of fraud and theft.
The only way to manage identity with the robustness required to provide the sort of trackability and accountability required for an application like that proposed is to use some sort of biometric identifier. Nazi Germany (and I don't bring them up just for shock value) understood that, and used tattooed numbers on the arms of Jews and other unfortunates to eliminate the possibility of identity fraud or theft.
In light of the logistical and capital requirements which a high-tech biometric system would require - and since we're talking about international travel and international border crossing, a strong ID project must be worldwide, not just US-based - it's simply not possible to think that we'd be able to use some sort of sexy high-tech retinal scanners, fingerprint scanners, hand geometry scanners, and so forth, to form the biometric basis of identity in such a system. The infrastructure doesn't exist, and can't be developed and deployed in anywhere near the time scale which would be required to address our current security problems, and the initial and recurring costs would be astronomical.
The only way we could implement a system like that, starting this year, would be with good old-fashioned human-readable or human-measurable factors which are unchangeable, or at least very difficult to change - and that means something like tattooing or branding every living human being, on a part of their body that's likely to be publically visible, so an unmarked person (or person with altered marks) would be immediately conspicuous. A human readable-mark like a tattooed number would allow border guards, immigration workers, employers, and others to verify a person's status and provide updates using analog technology like telephones, faxes, or slow dialup modems which are universally available and whose installation and maintenance are relatively well understood.
So let's say we do tattoo a number on the inside of everyone's forearm - would that incredible infringement on privacy and freedom and autonomy guarantee us our safety?
No, it would not - it would allow us to identify people who had done bad things in the past, and restrict their access to places or things which we anticipate might allow them to cause very great damage in the future - but it would do nothing at all to identify people who have not yet been caught doing anything wrong. It also would not stop otherwise disqualified people from seizing controlled resources by trickery or force, or from assembling destructive things out of otherwise unremarkable consumer goods (like the truck bomb which struck the Murrah federal building in OKC.)
Tim McVeigh wasn't wanted or suspected of anything prior to the OKC bombing - identity-based security wouldn't have prevented him from renting the truck, nor buying the fertilizer and airplane fuel used to build his bomb. All of the alleged WTC hijackers passed through immigration and other checkpoints without being detected as dangerous - if the technology and techniques we're discussing wouldn't even have prevented known attacks in the past, how can we imagine they'll be effective in the future?
It's a popular fantasy, this idea that people will faithfully report a "true name" which can be matched to a database of past actions which will reliably predict future behavior - but it's a failure in every way, from the notion of a true, unique name, to the idea that access to dossiers can be both widely available and reliable, to the idea that it's possible to know what someone will do tomorrow based on knowledge of his behavior in the past.
I can understand why people want to believe that it's possible - much like people want to believe that Marx' vision of Communism is possible, even in the face of many failed attempts which created only misery and starvation and death - but I'm disappointed to see that people's wish that it were possible turns out to be stronger than their common sense which should tell them that it is not.
When people talk about "ID checks", they're going down a slippery slope which leads to either ridiculously ineffective charades like our existing airport security - or to a deadly efficient system like forearm tattoos.
Is there anyone who wants any part of either of those visions of the future?
Can anyone articulate a feasible identity system, using technology available today in third-world countries, which would have prevented events like the WTC attack or the OKC bombing? How about anthrax in the mail?
If so, do you really want to live in that world?
If not, isn't it time we abandoned this "ID card" fairy tale, and start thinking about how to solve our current problems using the abilities and limitations of our current situation?

No, it means it's not meant to alter people's pre-existing status vis-a-vis detentions or trials; if they didn't include a clause like that, then people would argue that the executive order didn't just add to existing law, but replaced it, such that previously possible prosecutions would no longer be possible since they weren't explicitly permitted in the EO.
The crucial language is "limit the lawful authority", where the scope of the pre-existing "lawful authority" may be tiny or nonexistent. It's not correct to assume that there's (necessarily) any such lawful authority, absent other facts (like a declaration of martial law, or a person's status as a member of the military, etc.)

Unfortunately, one of the evolutionary steps in Mojo Nation's development has been their abandonment, for the most part, of user-visible and user-configurable economics; they deliberately made it difficult to see how many Mojo are held by the local broker, and relatively unlikely that a broker will be able to earn significant Mojo by careful pricing - recent clients are configured such that the economic brakes on resource usage are sharply curtailed or removed entirely.
It's my impression that, given the changes in the venture capital and software markets, they've refocused their efforts away from P2P filesharing and towards speedy realtime content delivery, whereby people with limited net connections can maximize their incoming bandwidth by pulling (or getting pushes) from multiple other parties simultaneously, somewhat similar to what Morpheus/Kazaa are doing, or what Bram Cohen (a Mojo Nation alumnus) is doing with BitTorrent.
The economics seemed to attract people who wanted to experiment with pricing, etc., but that wasn't necessarily a market or constituency which is interesting to investors or businesspeople.
It seems like there ought to be an interesting market here, but I know and worked with several people (with good financial backgrounds) who flogged this for awhile and never got anywhere. I guess a big part of the problem is that there's such a big difference in the perceived value of a megabyte/month of online storage .. if you're on the provider side, you think that's pretty expensive, as you've got the investment & etc required in building a data center, providing bandwidth to reach customers, paying staff, etc - but if you're on the customer side, you look at an 80 Gb drive at Fry's in the Sunday newspaper for $160 and think about a $500 1.5mb/s frame relay connection, and wonder why the service guys want $3 per Mb/month ..
and then the Mojo guys come along and make it sound like the people with the cheap frame relay connections and commodity PC hardware ought to be able to set up data centers in their back bedrooms or on their old laptops, but so far all of the business models proposed involve paying those guys up front for an indefinite period of storage, so there's no strong incentive to actually store the data for long, especially not if you can resell that same disk space 3 or 4 or 50 times.
Seems like the guys who really have hard data about options for bandwidth and disk usage are the disaster recovery guys. And that market hasn't been so great lately either, Comdisco declared bankruptcy and is their disaster recovery unit is getting swallowed up by Sungard, I think.
Anyway, yeah, the Enron guys thought there was something interesting to be done in bandwidth futures, too, but I don't know if they ever really got anything done before their demise beyond some demonstration projects.

What we're missing here is a party who's got a strong reputation and a deep balance sheet who's willing to offer to exchange, on a stable long-term basis, the hypothetical e-cash for something of value - dollars, gold, disk space, professional advice, whatever.
In a mature market, that role isn't necessarily played by one big participant, but by many small ones - e.g., the US government won't give me gold for my dollars, but lots of coin stores will, and besides, I've had pretty good luck exchanging my dollars for food, housing, computers, etc, in pretty stable fashion.
Until participants think that their time and investment made available to this system are reasonably likely to be available to them as outputs of one form or another, it'll be just another amusing hobby, like the existing P2P distribution systems (Gnutella, Napster, Morpheus/KaZaa, Mojo Nation, Freenet, etc).
I'd be willing to make resources I've got on hand available in exchange for less-well-known currencies, assuming I can have some confidence that the lesser-known currency will itself be exchangable for something that I want.
(I experimented with auctioning some items for grams of gold on  but didn't get any bids, and subsequently sold them for appreciably more in US dollars elsewhere, though some of that's probably due to GoldBarter's low profile versus Amazon and Ebay.)

Very early in its lifetime, the Autonomous Zones/Mojo Nation people said that maybe Mojo would someday be exchangable with real cash, though the assumption was that during the early stages of software development, people were playing with worthless currency for proof-of-concept, and that at some point the old Mojo would be useless or disabled, and people would start using New Mojo instead, where New Mojo might have real value.
Since then (that description is meant to be of the state of the Mojo Nation in October 2000 or so), they've abandoned plans for making Mojo valuable and/or convertible to other currencies, and it is only intended as a resource allocation tool and/or DoS prevention mechanism.
As far as I know - I stopped paying close attention to them when they shifted focus from a currency-based publishing system to a load-balanced content delivery system - they also give out all the Mojo you care to ask for, free, 10 million Mojos at a time - so it seems very unlikely that the current tokens will ever be convertible to real value, given that sort of inflationary history.
And that problem seems to be at the center of Nomen Nescio's sotto voce suggestion that some unnamed cypherpunks work up a currency which can be used to "pay" people for providing information which is of value - I get the impression that s/he is imagining some magic fairy would mint up piles of the currency, and assign it equally to every subscriber, who would then be empowered to pay it to the content providers they liked best.
That's very warm and fuzzy and hippy-like, but if these tokens are handed out for free, then what, exactly, is their value?
I think the Extropians did something like that, which ended in some sort of fiasco which some cypherpunks were involved in, though I don't know the details and was never a participant in that list/social circle.

It's my understanding that one hostage was killed early in the standoff, and that another team member (a coach?) was shot but escaped as the hostages were being captured initially.
Some time later, the German authorities provided the terrorists with a bus - the hostages and terrorists boarded the bus and drove to the airport, where two helicopters were waiting for them.
There - on the airport tarmac - there was a gunfight between (AFAIK) German police and the terrorists, which led to killing all of the remaining hostages, many of the terrorists, and some police.
A few months later, with the cooperation of the German government, a German airplane was captured in a faux hijacking, and those "hostages" were exchanged for the remaining terrorists in German custody. All but one of them have subsequently been assassinated by Mossad.
"One Day In September" is a documentary about this which isn't impossible to find on DVD or VHS.
.. or are you saying that the airport firefight took place between Israeli soldiers in German police uniforms and the terrorists?
That's not unimaginable, but the Israelis seem more competent, and inclined towards overwhelming force and rapid attack - see, e.g., their Operation Gift on 12/28/68, where three teams totalling 64 men destroyed 14 planes on the runway at Beirut International Airport in retaliation for a November attack on an El Al airliner. (See, e.g.,  or I don't have any personal knowledge about this - probably nobody on the list does - but I'm pretty skeptical of the claim that the airport attack was an Israeli creation - not because I think they're saints, but because it wasn't their style. Besides, it's hard to imagine that Germany would allow an Israeli military force to land at a German airport, take it over, use it to ambush terrorists, then blame the resulting casualties on the local authorities .. or that Israel would be able to do that without German cooperation. That just doesn't sound like something a government would do, especially not a German government dealing with Israel.

Per p. 41, as of July 1 2002, the Hills' salaries will be reduced to $225K, and Hevizi's (the CEO) to $300K.
(which is still a lot of money, given all that they've burned through, for a company in this position.)
Also, the General Manager for the Enterprise Privacy Management group, Mark Weidick, resigned his $338K position as of May 31 2002. Enterprise Privacy Management is supposed to be a big part of their new business focus, receiving 40% of the proceeds of the IPO.
I get the impression that even though Stefan Brands has left ZKS, they've retained an option to purchase one or more of his patents, that option expiring in August.
(cf. ZKS has also been the subject of three lawsuits for wrongful termination worth an aggregate of $240K, and have an ongoing dispute about a settlement gone bad, where the other party is seeking $630K and ZKS is seeking $100K + the return of a gift of 74,500 common shares (recently valued at around .75 each). Anyone want to bet the unnamed individual with the disputed settlement is Brands?

Take a look at . Non-US citizens may be classified as residents, nonresidents, or as dual status aliens; they also frequently can choose whether they would prefer to file as residents or nonresidents; this is an area where professional assistance is very helpful.
Subsequent replies to this question have, in an unproductive fashion, confused US citizens living outside the US and former citizens living outside the US; the 10-year rule applies to people who have given up their US citizenship. People who remain citizens while living elsewhere are subject to US tax on their worldwide income (but, some income is excluded, and some income which is taxed by other jurisdictions won't be taxed again by the US) for as long as they're alive.

For another data point, see this Netcraft survey circa January 2001 -
.. it shows approx 108,000 secure servers (they don't total it, and I didn't
bother adding up all the CA's with 10 certs in use.)
Security Space's numbers for the same timeframe show that they found 58,117
servers - .
I don't know if the difference means that, between Jan 2001 and Jun 2002,
Security Space has discovered the other 40,000 secure servers in use; or
if they always see a fraction of what Netcraft does. (Netcraft's current data
is available for a yearly subscription at 1200 UKP.)
What I find especially telling in the recent Security Space results is the breakdown by "validity" -
Valid: 17833
Self-signed: 5275
Unknown signer: 13348
Cert-host mismatch: 32536
Expired: 35071
.. so, less than 20% of the certificates that they find on SSL servers in use on the open Internet are functioning correctly as part of a PKI; even if we assume that every one of the self-signed and
unknown signer certs servers are participating in undocumented or private PKIs such that their details are
unavailable to surveys like this one, that's still only 40% of the visible SSL servers. The remaining 60% are apparently misconfigured or forgotten.

See  for recent data re SSL certificate market share; Geotrust, at , has 11% of the market, and appears (from their web pages; I haven't bought one) to be ready to issue SSL server certs without the torturous document review process which Verisign invented but Thawte managed to make simultaneously more intrusive and less relevant.

@_subject: Re: Bankrupt Digicash Made $481K in 1999 
(since the PKI market's been in the toilet, I've been learning about taxation)
Even that assumes too much - there wasn't necessarily a transfer of money. If, for example (and this is purely hypothetical), Chaum had agreed to work for DC in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of stock, and $481K was the fair market value of those shares, then it would be proper to issue a 1099-MISC with that amount in Box 3 and Chaum would be taxed on that $481K as income, even though he received it as stock instead of cash.
(If the circumstances were different, the income might be expected to show up in Box 7, "nonemployee compensation"; but here it's in Box 3, which should transfer directly either to Line 21 on the 1040 for miscellaneous income, or onto a Schedule C, assuming it's an individual taxpayer, which isn't the case here.)
This sort of 1099 is also what you'd expect to see going to the recipient of cash as damages following or related to a lawsuit.
If Digicash loaned money to Chaum and later forgave the debt (not unusual, where a founder or other important employee wants to exercise stock options early but doesn't have cash for the exercise), Chaum would be obligated to report the forgiven debt as income but a 1099 would not be required; that doesn't stop people from sending them anyway.

I've been experimenting with it some this morning - it's a memory and CPU hog, turning 10-20K input
files into 20-30M data files, and using 300-500M of RAM and a few minutes of CPU time on a relatively fast
Athlon in the process.
Nothing interesting to report yet, other than a hunch that it'd be improved by rewriting some parts
in C, and/or using a resource storage format that's more appropriate for big data sets, like a database. It seems to want to keep everything in RAM at once.

@_subject: Re: Random Privacy 
That doesn't sound like a solution to me - they haven't provided anything to motivate
people to answer honestly, nor do they address the basic problem, which is relying on
the good will and good behavior of the marketers - if a website visitor is to trust a privacy policy which says "We'll never use this data to annoy or harm you",
they're likely to be unimpressed with a privacy policy which says "We'll use fancy
math tricks to hide the information you give us from ourselves."
That's not going to change unless they move the randomizing behavior off of the marketer's machine and
onto the visitor's machine, allowing the visitor to observe and verify the operation of the privacy technology .. which is about as likely as a real audit of security-sensitive source code, where that likelihood is tiny now and shrinking rapidly the closer we get to the TCPA/Palladium nirvana.
So, no, fancy tricks won't solve the basic problem, which is that once you give information to other people, you've got no control over what they do with it.

warrant idea to Alan Dershowitz, whom he describes as a good friend and a
"great civil libertarian".

Um, no, it didn't. There was no jury in Silveira - Silveira was a constitutional challenge to legislation, which is a question of law decided by judges, not a fact question decided by juries.
Did you actually read the opinion, or just read some screwball summary of it?
Nope. That opinion was written, as the citation indicated, by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, not the Supreme Court.
While I do think that the 2nd Amendment does, in fact, protect an individual right to keep and bear arms, I think that the 1st Circuit's reasoning re _Miller_ in _Cases_ is actually quite reasonable. The opinion points out that interpreting _Miller_ so that it says the 2nd Amendment means that Congress can regulate firearms, but only ineffective or useless ones, is nonsensical. While I don't think the Ninth Circuit reads _Miller_ in a reasonable fashion, I don't think the "only useless weapons may be regulated" is an especially rational interpretation of it, either.
Yes, that is an unreasonable conclusion to reach. It is also unreasonable to conclude that the 2nd Amendment means that no regulation of weapons is constitutionally permissible. Even the 1st Amendment - which contains the words "shall make no law" - is interpreted to allow some regulation of speech. (e.g., shouting theater in a crowded fire, etc.)
