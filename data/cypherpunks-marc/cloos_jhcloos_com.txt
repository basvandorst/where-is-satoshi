That quote pretty much answers the question.  Perhaps an example would help:
Let's choose v=52, like a deck of playing cards (we'll leave the Jokers
inside the beltway).  Let's use 23-card blocks (k=23) and 5-card hands (t=5).
The goal to to find a set of 23-card blocks such that every possible
5-card hand can be found in at least one block.  Hense, the set of 23-
card blocks covers the set of possible 5-card hands.
That can be done trivially by making the blocks be every possible
23-card hand.  But ( 52 \choose 23 ) is about 352 trillion.  So we
want to find a smaller set of blocks which cover every possible 5-
card hand.
Their site has one covering for (53,23,5) with 243 blocks.  It also
shows that they started with a 272-block covering and worked their
way down to 243 blocks via "dynamic programming".
THe application the cryptography is probably something to do with
statistical cryptanalysis.  Rainbow tables, maybe?

A quick look shows that both files use DCT-compressed 300-dpi images
for each page; they may be scans.
Attempts to unredact should treat the pages as the jpegs they are.
I suspect matching the font and testing pixel lengths at 300 dpi
may be the only productive attack, but there is variation in the
intensity of the pixels in the redaction; perhaps something can
be found by analyzing it as pixel data?  Or perhaps the variation
is just a combination of quantum noise from the scan and jpeg/DCT
