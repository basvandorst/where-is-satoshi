I'm certain there are thresholds to that. Carrier grade mitigation
solutions will start low and ramp up to 5, 6, 7, etc. figures
depending on the attack and amount of bandwidth to be filtered among
other variables.
My point was, if you "mitigate" the attack vs. null routing the target you have to pay for the transit that the attack consumes between your network and the upstream network(s).

verizon's ddos service was/is 3250/month flat... not extra if there
was some sort of incident, and completely self-service for the
customer(s). Is 3250/month a reasonable insurance against loss?
(40k/yr or there abouts)
That doesn't sound too unreasonable as long as you are in a market Verizon services and you can find the right Verizon rep who isn't trying to sell transit at $25/mbps.

Yes, and I have no problem with this in theory, I just wish that some of the larger ones could proactively monitor their networks to avoid crushing the smaller ones but maybe this is intentional.
I have seen a huge increase in the number of attacks originating from other "hosting" companies recently. Previously it had mainly been cable modems, etc.
It must be much easier to just target IaaS providers to build botnets because each machine there has 1Gbps than to worry about collecting 100 10Mbps cable modem customers.

Nobody has really driven the point home that yes you can purchase a system from Arbor, RioRey, make your own mitigation system; what-have you, but you still have to pay for the transit to digest the attack, which is probably the main cost right now.

I see a link-filling attacks with some regularity; but again, what I'm saying is simply that they aren't as prevalent as they used to be, because the attackers don't *need* to fill links in order to achieve their goals, in many cases.
That being said, high-bandwidth DNS reflection/amplification attacks tip the scales, every time.
This is a very important point - determined attackers will observe and react in order to try and defeat successful countermeasures, so the defenders must watch for shifting attack vectors.

I should've "qualified" my question by saying "What valid application which traverses the Internet and could be seen at the edge of a network actually uses UDP 80?"
I can't imagine there is too much Cisco NAC client for macs carrying on over the Internet, although I have been wrong in the past.

The Cisco NAC client for Macs, for the purpose of "VLAN change
detection", sends UDP/80 packets to the host's reversed default
gateway (i.e., if the actual gateway is 1.2.3.4, it sends the packets
to 4.3.2.1) once every five seconds.

Honestly we can usually point to the exact cause of the attacks once we have time to triage the situation.
Recently it has been stuff like:
-Made someone in Asia angry.
-Running a runescape server and made someone angry
-Made someone on IRC angry
It has been pretty rare to see an attack that wasn't just the end result of a pissing contest.
and like I said most of the ones I have seen recently are either UDP 80 floods which is probably the result of one of the UDP.PL variants or fragments (UDP DST 0) attacks which kind of indicates at least in part that the 'attacker' simply downloaded the first thing they could find that said 'DDoS' on it and didn't spend too much time worrying about it.
This is probably mainly because of how easy it is now to acquire dedicated servers (that arent properly monitored) and have 1Gbps (and now) 10Gbps connections to the Internet.
How many organizations are using 10G connections to the Internet these days?

Another thing to be aware of--when you get hit with what seems to be
a "simple" flooding attack aimed at one point of your infrastructure...
start checking your logs at _other_ places in your network very, VERY
There seems to be a trend of using larger-scale flooding, or other
simple types of attacks to get all the network people at an organization
rushing over to throw resources and energy at it...while the real target
of the attack is something completely different, on a different subnet, in
a different part of the company; and that attack is small, carefully focused
at its target, and is designed to be relatively quiet.  The "big" attack is used
simply to ensure all the human energy is focused on the wrong place,
increasing the chance that what otherwise might caused raised eyebrows
and double-checking of logs/IDS alerts, etc. gets missed while everyone
is focusing on the"big" attack.
And, in what seems to be an increasing trend, what they are watching
for is *not* necessarily the result of the large botnet attack; they're checking
on the results of their targeted probes elsewhere in the network, or on the
outbound set of connections from a compromised machine within an
organization; after all, during a huge DDoS attack, with everyone focusing
on a set of uplinks being flooded with _inbound_ traffic, who is going to
notice the (relatively smaller) outbound spike of traffic as the compromised
machine sends out a copy of your internal intellectual property to the
miscreant recipients?
(speaking purely hypothetically, of course, and definitely not on behalf
of any institution or entity other than myself)

Upstream providers generally have a hard time allowing you to write routes that you don't own into their table(s).

Hmm.  What would be really cool is if you could use Snort, NetFlow/NBAR, or some other sort of DPI tech to find specifically the IP addresses of the DDoS bots, and then pass that information back upstream via BGP communities that tell your peer router to drop traffic from those addresses.  That way the target of the traffic can continue to function if the DDoS traffic doesn't closely mimic the normal traffic.
Your BGP peer router would need to have lots of memory for /32 or /64 routes though.
Anyone heard of such a beast?  Or is this how the stuff from places like Arbor Networks do their thing?

You can get a dedicated server for $80 with a 1Gbps connection to the Internet without looking that hard.
It is pretty easy/cheap to kill a 1Gbps connection now a days.
Soon several providers will begin offering dedicated servers with a 10Gbps connection to a single machine.

< 1 Gbps attacks used to be standard issue but as of the past 90 days
we have been seeing 2 - 8 Gbps a lot more frequently.

Actually, most DDoS attacks aren't link-flooding attacks - this hasn't been true for the last ~7 years or so.
I'm not saying it doesn't happen, because it does, and sometimes quite spectacularly - but in most cases, the attackers don't have to flood the link to achieve their desired goal.

The most common attacks that I have seen over the last 12 months, and let's say I have seen a fair share have been easily detectable by the source network.
It is either protocol 17 (UDP) dst port 80 or UDP Fragments (dst port 0..)
What valid application actually uses UDP 80?
You could literally wipe out a large amount of these attacks by simply filtering this.

Yes, but this obviously completes the 'DDoS attack' and sends the signal that the bully will win.

A very common action is to blackhole ddos traffic upstream by sending a bgp route to the next AS with a preestablished community indicating the traffic must be sent to Null0.
