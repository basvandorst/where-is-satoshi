Encryption is always important if police or someone wants to analyzse
your drives. As far as I know is the trojan windows-only software, so
you should be pretty sure with an encrypted Ubuntu. Some Investigators
install the trojan by breaking into your house while you are not at home
and installing it manually at your computer. In this scenario, the
encryption would be an extra protection.

I read lots of articles and analysis about the ?Bundestrojaner? (that´s
how the german keylogger is called here). It seems like you don´t have
to worry. It is more a virus construction kit than a virus. In
accordance with the Chaos Computer Club they´ll need about 10 experts
working 5 months just to develop and adapt one keylogger. It makes also
sense to install one Linux Distribution. I use Ubuntu 11.04 on my second
notebook, fully encrypted (can be choosen while the installation, just
choose the ?alternate disc? to download). It is much more faster, more
secure and just better then Win7.
If you have to use Windows 7, try the Truecrypt Preeboot encryption. It
is open source software and pretty authentic. With Truecrypt, you can
also encrypt external drives. The most important part of the whole
encryption thing is the password, choose it as long as possible. The
only possibility to crack such an encryption is bruteforce, and using a
long password will destroy this chance.
So far.
