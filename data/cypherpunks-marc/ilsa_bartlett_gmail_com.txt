I did not click on the link and just never would. I stood next to Aaron's
brother in a hackathon in honor of The Work.
The Work touches my heart.
I wear my Grace Host shirt proudly. Any person can kick dust in the road
and hope it mixes with some s*%t of the shit kicker and get traction... and
lookie ..Is this success? Where any attention, either good or bad, is worth
the bucket.
I am pulling for the next Aaron kind of guy with a great vision steps
forward fearlessly to lead all us wanna bees forward in the foot steps of
dear dear gentle Aaron and his kind gentle family and friends.
smile, Ruby

I read the entire article and I say this has a chilling sensation of a
Bruce Willis movie.
The 5 eyes now including france against germany etc in a return to 19oo'
