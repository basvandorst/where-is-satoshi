I really found this helpful:
Thanks! :-)
Now, what would be nice is to delete the older version of the Apache server
off my Red Hat 7.3 machine. I know, it doesn't hurt anything by remaining
there, but why waste space with two separate installations.
I noted a config.layout in /usr/local/src/httpd-2.0.49, and in this file is:
#   Red Hat Linux 7.x layout
    prefix:        /usr
    exec_prefix:   ${prefix}
    bindir:        ${prefix}/bin
    sbindir:       ${prefix}/sbin
    libdir:        ${prefix}/lib
    libexecdir:    ${prefix}/lib/apache
    mandir:        ${prefix}/man
    sysconfdir:    /etc/httpd/conf
    datadir:       /var/www

    errordir:      ${datadir}/error
    iconsdir:      ${datadir}/icons

    manualdir:     ${datadir}/manual
    cgidir:        ${datadir}/cgi-bin

    localstatedir: /var
    runtimedir:    ${localstatedir}/run
    logfiledir:    ${localstatedir}/log/httpd
    proxycachedir: ${localstatedir}/cache/httpd
Could I delete selectively files from this distribution?
