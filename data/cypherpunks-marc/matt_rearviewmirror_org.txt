Bah. Read a physics text sometime. Miss the catch and the payload continues on in it's original path, which would be at a tangent to the intended orbit and therefore to the surface.
As for NASA playing "plutonium slingshot", they did indeed - with a huge margin for error, and a design so pessimistic that even if the damned thing had slammed head-on into the planet, there would almost certainly have been zero contamination. If the canister HAD broken, the contamination would have been roughly on the scale of Three Mile Island, which killed 0 people and did 0 environmental damage.
If you and the other idiots want to object to the things NASA and others do, fine. Be my guest. But do your homework FIRST.

High LEO launch costs are just down payments. It's literally true, energy-wise, that LEO is halfway to anywhere in the solar system. What's needed is a group of intelligent people and a "seed stock" of technology on the Moon. Teleoperation is great technology, but what's the point in these endeavours without a human component? Besides, teleoperation and AI and everything else breaks down, and the more complicated a thing is the easier it is to break it. Wheras humans... well, Scott Carpenter's description of an astronaut was roughly something like "A nonlinear computer with over 1 billion binary decision elements, weighing less than 200 pounds, and capable of being produced by unskilled labor". A large enough human presence is self-repairing, self-replicating, and self-controlling. The perfect world for rapid expansion.
Backwards. Higher orbit == lower velocity. As each component is added, you increase the mass of the station. You increase the energy of the total structure because the new component carries with it kinetic energy realized from the decrease in altitude, but rendevous and docking will probably waste all of that advantage in braking burns. Your chief advantage is that it takes much less energy to get from the Moon's surface to LEO than it does to get from the Earth's surface to LEO.
Why would you want to? If it's the size of Wales and solar maximum begins to drag it lower, how in the hell would you boost it again without throwing away all of Swansea as fuel? Easier and cheaper to use lunar material to build stations and equipment in High Earth Orbit, GEO, and at the LaGrange points. Especially at L4 and L5, you could build your station as large as you want (O'Neill designed them as large as 30 km, IIRC) and never worry about the mass because it won't ever go anywhere.
More like "11". Salyut 1 through 7, Skylab, Mir, and ISS or whatever the hell they're calling it this week. In terms of habitable volume, the Salyuts are the smallest, followed by Mir before expansion, then Skylab, then Mir after expansion, then ISS-as-designed. ISS-as-built is, I believe, somewhere between Mir and Skylab, although to be fair they aren't done yet.
And for serious-but-light reading on the topic, look for "Colonies In Space" by Heppenheimer, "The High Frontier" by Dr. O'Neill, and more recently "Entering Space" by Zubrin. The first two are wildly optimistic, the last is actually rather pessimistic - I could argue with the numbers of all three, and reality is probably somewhere in the middle. The three also increase in technical detail and decrease is "fun" as you go down the list.

Everyone's been saying this, but what's your source? How do you know there haven't been any pulmonary cases? Agreed, strange coincidence.
But it's as low as 6 days. By the classic pattern, there should be a few new cases at the bottom end of the incubation period, with new cases appearing at an accelerating rate. Since anthrax is supposedly not human-communicable (one human is not contagious to other humans) and if there was a single "infection point" in the timeline (meaning there could have been any number of infection *sites*, provided they all were released at the same time) then we should be able to look back after the fact and see a bell curve of anthrax cases - a few at six days after the infection point, a few more at ten, more at 20, a maximum somewhere around 35, then tailing off with the number of new cases decreasing until we hit one or two final cases at 60 days. If this is the start of the Bell curve, then the infection point should have been about 10 days ago - which means it would probably have to be a different team, rather than something set up by Atta and company.
The other possibility, of course, is that there was a poor, limited-dispersal attempt at infection, in which case there might only be a total of one or two successful infections - in which case, with the maximum at 35 days and using September 11 as our infection point, we might be at the maximum and these few cases (assume one or two mis- or un-diagnosed) are all we will see. That would be at odds with the apparent level of training and planning by the 9/11 terrorists, but doesn't rule the possibility out.
I do agree two cases, in close proximity, among (apparently) non-farmers is a strange coincidence so close on the heels of a terrorist attack.

I knew this would happen, I just knew it...
Of course there's a frigging distinction. I said that the first time around. My problem with your statement is not that you said there was a distinction, it was your definition.
Capitalism is not philosophy for the same reason that a dog is not cheese. Capitalism is a economic system, a form of commerce, and nothing more. Philosophy is a method of looking at the world around you and attempting to apply a system of rules to it. You can have a philosophy that includes capitalism - either positivly or negatively - but you cannot have capitalism *as* a philosophy. That is quite literally like saying having a nice car is happiness. It's not. Having a nice car might make you happy, but it is not itself happiness. Please go back to third grade and relearn the concept of No. "Capitalism" is an economic system. "Democracy" is a form of government, one of the classic forms as a matter of fact. "Communism" is both, but it is not the same thing - Communist government is essentially a form of pure democracy, in that all members of the commune have an equal say in the distribution of the resources of the commune, exactly as a pure democracy does. Communism as an economic system is a model which posits the distribution of resources (output) based purely on need, and the distribution of work (input) purely on ability, with relationship defined between input and output.
No. I already defined capitalism. You weren't paying attention. Five demerits.
What you have defined is a philosophy, a belief system which incorporates capitalism. The important difference is that your philosophy, in an infantile way, ascribes motives and emotions to the workings of capitalism. This is incorrect. You mean:
"When all you have is a hammer, all problems start to look like nails." Attribution, Iago, attribution!
Your first definition is doublespeak. You just stated that commerce is an "economic" exchange of goods and services. Economics are of course a major portion of commerce - in fact, if you include in "economics" emotional exchanges, it can be said to be equal to commerce. So your statement is semantically true, but valueless, since anything is of course equal to itself. Your second is a limited definition - change "individuals" to "any entity" and you have exactly the same definition I gave when I joined the thread, in contradiction to your own statement about the definition of commerce and You can speak axiomatically, or algorithmically, but you can't do both. Axiomatic is philisophical, algorithmic is mathematical. The two are not Which is an interesting (if pointless) question, but it's not the original question. The original question is whether or not you were giving the correct definitions of commerce and capitalism, and of course you were not. Raise your hand if you're shocked.

Would you mind sticking to the topic? I did not say Communism was a form of Capitalism, I said Capitalism and Communism were both forms of Commerce. No. The belief that capitalism is the only mechanism to solve problems is philosophy, not commerce, and pretty bad philosophy at that. Are you learning impaired?

It's not worth the effort. It's not worth the effort. It won't make a
damn bit of difference.
Oh, fuckit.
Capitalism is a meritocracy. *Commerce* is simply a label for that class
of activities that include all forms of resource transfer from one
entity (person, company, nation, world) to another. Some of those are
meritocracies, such as capitalism. Others are not - true communism is
one example, almost any form of "planned economy", welfare. As for your definition of capitalism - lay the crack pipe *down*, and
slowly step away. Capitalism, pure and simple, is the idea that
competition and market forces will solve problems. Price of bread too
high? Someone will open a cheaper bakery. Too many bakeries for the
market? Those with the weakest support and poorest quality will fail.
That's all. Everything else is an add-on. It's a meritcracy because
emotion and sentiment are not supposed to enter into the equation -
either succeed or fail, based on how well you compete. Period. Reality
is not that simple, but then, reality seldom is.
Hello Mr. Pot, and how are you today? What's that? Who's black?
I'm beginning to think that Mr. Choate should never, ever, be allowed to
declare a discussion finished or claim to have the "last word".

Um, no. The SecurityFocus story reports that Adrian Lamo found the security hole in the NYT network. That's not "giving the numbers away to crackers".
Lamo is a well-known security expert and "white-hat" hacker - he breaks into
systems, usually without doing anything that would be considered "illegal",
then reports the results to the company in question. He also usually reports
the details of the hack to SecurityFocus (although usually not until the company in question has closed the hole) in order to publicize the problem
for the benefit of other companies that might have similar problems.
