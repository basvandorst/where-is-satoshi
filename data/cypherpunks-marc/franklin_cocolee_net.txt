I really want to flirt with someone right now. My spot between my legs is moist and I can't leave it
alone anymore. I want to show you on my cam.
Wisdom is the wealth of the wise. Have fun,
Modulation in all things. Blood is thicker than water. . All the day you'll have good luck.. What boots up must come down. . Some of the best gifts come in small packages. .
You can't get blood out of a stone. Find a coin pick it up
.Do right and fear no man. . At a round table there's no dispute about the place. . Sound as a bell. .
Grief divided is made lighter. . He is rich that is satisfied. . Oh, what a tangled web site we weave when first we practice. .
Curses, like chickens come home to roost. . Variety is the spice of life. . The bigger, the better. .
If you really don't want more from then....
