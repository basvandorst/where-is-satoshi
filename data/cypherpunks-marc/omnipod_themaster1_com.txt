@_subject: OnDemand Secure Instant Messaging 
Instant Messaging - it is in your enterprise whether you like it or not.
According to the Radicati Group, 85% of all enterprises have public IM in
use but only 12% of them have an enterprise solution for securing and
managing IM.
In the past two months, five major viruses attacked the consumer IM
networks. According to a study by SurfControl, consumer IM is considered
one of the greatest vulnerabilities in network enterprise security.
Recognizing the value of real time messaging and the insecurity of the
consumer IM networks, hundreds of companies and enterprises such as Pepsi,
Mayo Clinic, the States of Florida and Virginia, 1800 Dentist, Atlas Air,
iPass, University of New Mexico and Thomson Financial use Omnipod's
OnDemand Secure IM solution. Why? Because Omnipods private IM network
encrypts all messages, allows complete management and control of user
groups and provides policy enforcement procedures while still allowing
safe interoperability with AOL, MSN and Yahoo! Messengers.
And, if you need to meet SEC, NASD, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley or internal
compliance issues, nothing is easier than simply downloading and
installing Omnipod.
