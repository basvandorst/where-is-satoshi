and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation  an oil and gas technology |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natura|.
The Companys other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to file a Form 10 in the immediate future.
