@_subject: Re: [cryptography] Bitcoin in endgame 
This was an offtopic discussion from the start. The original paper does
not include anything about crypto.
Anyway, the problem you mention is exactly the one described in the paper.
"Using Mancur Olsen's rationale that a prince is a bandit that stops
roving, the notion of the mining franchise being captured by the botnets
might have been an acceptable compromise to the economy growing up
around bitcoin mining, if it went no further [Olsen].  However,
criminals are rarely satiated.  Several things happen: (a) incentives
for easy money naturally cause an increase in criminal participation at
all levels, such as direct theft of bitcoins.  This increase across the
board encourages (b) honest users to pack up and leave.  Both of these
effects combine to create rising criminality, and (c) at some stage the
Feds get involved.  Finally, (d) the system collapses."
