Please allow me to apologize -- I'm considering replacing the ds.pro-ns.net CDR node.  "cryptofortress.com" is mine, and I had believed
I only had it set up to forward cypherpunks postings to a testing list
while I worked on the details.  Obviously, this was not the case,
and I have deactivated it while I look for the cause of the problem.
I realize that mailing lists doing this sort of thing is irritating,
and I'll try to make sure it doesn't happen again.

The California State Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers,
hunters, fishermen and golfers to take extra precautions and keep alert for
bears while in the Yosemite and Mammoth areas. They advise people to
wear noise-producing devices such as little bells on their clothing to alert
but not startle the bear unexpectedly. They also advise carrying pepper
spray in case of an encounter with a bear.
It is also a good idea to watch for fresh signs of bear activity and
know the difference between black bear and grizzly bear droppings.
Black bear droppings are smaller and contain berries and possibly squirrel
Grizzly bear droppings have little bells in them and smell like pepper

Sorry for the intrusion.  (I upgraded Majordomo, and the list is quiet
enough that I'm not sure if I broke anything.)
Please ignore this message to the best of your ability.

[some spam]
Sorry, folks.  Hit the wrong key.  Apologies for forwarding spam instead
of deleting it.

Eric hasn't formally abdicated, but let me remind everyone and the archives
that there's an alternative node, cypherpunks that runs in a
substantially similar way to Eric's.  It even uses some or most of the same
scripts that Eric uses on lne.com.
(The functionality that we're referring to here is that spam is mostly kept off
list by only allowing posts from members of the list plus known anonymous
remailers, known members of other nodes, etc.  Posts that don't make it
initially get forwarded by the node owners, and then posts from that user make
it automatically from then on.)
The ds.pro-ns.net node is hosted at the ISP that I own, so it doesn't suffer
from any dialup connectivity issues.
(I volunteered to take over for Eric in private email.  He suggested that
I remind everyone of the alternative, first.)
