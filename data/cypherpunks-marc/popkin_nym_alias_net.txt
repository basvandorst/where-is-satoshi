Kill every sitting politician and bureaucrat tonight, and tomorrow
their hundred million constituents would be stumbling over each other
in their haste to erect new ones in place of those killed.
Kill the hundred million, and government would dry up and blow away,
but it ain't gonna happen.
Who are the hundred million?  Start with Social Security recipients
and go from there.
Compiling a list of a few hundred is tilting at windmills.

Good point.  So they're tarred with the same brush.

Yes, but the reason it's bullshit is that shooting messengers does no
good.  It leaves intact the originators of the message, all hundred-
million of them.  Tomorrow, the hundred million will be stumbling over
each other trying to empower new messengers to replace those fallen.
Who else but the messengers (politicians, bureaucrats, etc.) is going
to collect the money to pay the Social Security, after all?  Who else
is going to halt the drug trade?
Worse than the secret ballot?

Interesting.  Even more interesting would be to get cooperation of the
paper's editor on the project: (1) avoid paying full price for the
space, (2) gain a free-speech ally.
Here's a little list from google.
Listed below are general newspapers in the Seattle area.
     1   King County Journal (multiple locations)

That wasn't the idea.  The idea was to push the publication in the
State's face, daring them to respond.
