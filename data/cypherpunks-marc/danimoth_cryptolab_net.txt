I agree with you and I propose a simply protocol which follows your
- encrypt your data with a simmetric cipher and a private and robust key - make an hash of the encrypted data and store it securely (no loss
  possibile) offline
- upload the encrypted data over some service.
- download the encrypted data when you need it, check the hash and
  decrypt with the key used in the first pass.
In this (simple) case, what is run server side does not nullify security
properties (confidentiality and integrity in this example), provided
that what is run user-side is "ok".

In these months there was a lot of talking about "metadata", which SMTP
exposes regardless of encryption or authentication. In the design of
this p2p system, should metadata's problem kept in consideration or not?
IMHO exposing danimoth or my  it's the same, as there is
a function between them. I2P and/or Tor adds complexity to avoid such
mapping to any non-state-level adversary.

I missed that part completely. What does it mean that "UDP is too slow
because of packet size of 64 kb" ? To me, it seems an ugly claim. Do you know that ethernet will fragment it in pieces of ~1 kb, and the most common segment size on the Internet is around 500 bytes ? TCP maximum segment size is also 16 bit long.. Your proposal requires
a modification of the most transport protocols of the internet, and IPv6 with jumbo frames?
Really, take a look onto DC nets, they are quite old but far superior to
your proposal (but they have some drawbacks).
I see too much approximation, I'm sorry.

Apart from english (I'm using aspell as spellchecker, and it works
well.. give it a try), do you have read some literature about this
field? Are you on the "state of art" ? What are the differences (and why
they are better) among your proposal and, say, DC nets or onion nets ?
Thank you

You are still ignoring my advice to read something about DC nets.
Unfortunately, you are so committed with your opinions, even when facing
a blocking problems (like ISP-blocking your spoofed traffic) that is
near impossible to ''guide`` you. Even in real life, your approach is
totally broken; you should stand on the shoulders of giants and, if you
can, add little pieces to well known state-of-art.
So, instead to wrote / invent / make an anonymous system from scratch,
go using [1] and studying it. From its webpage:
Dissent builds on dining cryptographers and verifiable shuffle
algorithms to offer provable anonymity guarantees, even in the face of
traffic analysis attacks, of the kinds likely to be feasible for
authoritarian governments and their state-controlled ISPs for example.
Dissent seeks to offer accountable anonymity, giving users strong
guarantees of anonymity while also protecting online groups or forums
from anonymous abuse such as spam, Sybil attacks, and sockpuppetry.
Unlike other systems, Dissent can guarantee that each user of an online
forum gets exactly one bandwidth share, one vote, or one pseudonym,
which other users can block in the event of misbehavior.
In your previous email, you clearly doesn't know what you're talking

Hi Cathal,
I do not want to start a flame-war, just my opinions inline.
You're assuming that new releases == new bugs, my assumption is new
releases == new bugs fixed.
You're right (in a general sense) when the updated software has new
features; new features have always new bugs (but major number version
advancement does not often happen).
What I really hate is the "I'm better than developers" mentality. What I
want is using the lastest version from official developers (e.g.
lastestes version of OpenSSL, right now at 1.0.1i) and not an old
version patched with pieces of code taken from later releases (e.g.
OpenSSL 1.0.1e in Wheezy). The focal point is really simple: I do not
trust packagers which heavily edit the software they are packaging
(Debian, Arch, Mint.. no differences here) because I consider the
software developers the only ones which can "safely" (<-- take it with a
grain of salt) make modifications to their software.

Don't trust distro that do not use vanilla packages (like Debian, of
Try to trust who build vanilla packages; usually developers know much
more on their software than an anonymous packager.
For example, I cite ArchLinux [1] where it is clear that they take
patches directly from [2].

Usually the right place to discuss these kind of things is in the
