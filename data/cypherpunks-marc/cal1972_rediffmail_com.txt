@_subject: Need some help-Carnivore questions 
This letter is in regards to the email sent to you with the subject line "CDR: Public Demo of Carnivore and Friends".  I found the information to be extremely helpful as I am currently researching the Carnivore system and the cover-up by the FBI/DOJ.  I will be presenting my research to my honors board at the end of August at Westminster College.  I was wondering if you could help me by providing some contacts that will be able to give me more information on the program, etc.  I have been researching this for 2 years and I have a ton of resources but I'm hoping to find some of the "good stuff" if you know what I mean.  Any help would be appreciated, all correspondence can be done anonymously, no names will be needed.  Thanks for your help, Cal
