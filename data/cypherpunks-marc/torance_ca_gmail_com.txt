e moron running a relay from their home Internet connection.
-Port-Scanner is running from home, too. =A0Comedy from all directions.
I am going to have to agree with Sebastian here. I think that there
are more relays running from home then people realize. No, they
probably are not running in the high end as some of those relays that
are able to have company or some other type of backing. But they are
relays just the same and are part of the Tor network and are depended
on just like any of the others.
To pay out of ones pocket for the bandwidth for a dedicated Tor relay
is not cheap. So kudo's to those that are able to run their dedicated
relays from home on their own expense. Adding that it is not said
enough, if it were not for the  individual relays from home, I don't
believe that there would be as many relay nodes as we have now.
Thank you all out there that are able to, for donating your time,
money, equipment, etc., in running relays from your home. The more the

That may be so in some jurisdictions, but not in all. If my memory services
me correct, that might be very true in Germany , possible in Austria and
other Europe jurisdictions.  However, I do not believe it is that way in
the United States and I am sure there are other jurisdictions that most
likely are not that way. Just imo
