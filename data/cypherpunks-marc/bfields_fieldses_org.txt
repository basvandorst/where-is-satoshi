An example of a "right of a copyright owner under this title" is the right
to distribute copies of a work.  A copy-protection scheme limits the
exercise of this right.  The "copyright owner" referred to here is the
person who the particular right belongs to, not necessarily the person
whose exercise of that right is being limited.
