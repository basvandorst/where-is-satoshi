I've run 'urpmi --auto-select' to upgrade from 10.1 to cooker.  The one
difference I've noticed is sylpheed-gtk2 is displaying better.  It used
to have unnecessary whitespace between the lines in its subject list
and is fine now.  I assume the problem has been fixed by the new sylpheed-claws or by the
new XOrg.  Unfortunately there's no way to tell the source of the
improvement :-<
