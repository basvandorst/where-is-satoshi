I didn't say anything about trying to run away.  That probably won't accomplish a whole lot in the long run.   But when all of your bank accounts and credit cards are frozen, and your house is a crime scene, at least you have the means to rent a hotel room, contact family/lawyers, etc.
And no, I'm not OK with people keeping any money that was donated for a specific purpose in excess of what was actually used.  You'd hope that he'd be a good guy about it and give back the portion that wasn't used, or clearly state that any excess will go to charity or something.  However, there's no such guarantee (short of doing it through a trust fund with his lawyer), and just like any philanthropic venture, it's up to each donor choose when/if they'll help out.   It's just like Kickstarter -- you hope to get something good out of it, but if it bombs, well... you pay your money and you take your chances.

Anyone who DOESN'T have such things stashed away somewhere is, IMHO, incredibly naive and taking on quite a large amount of risk.
The likelihood (and hope) is that you'll never need it.  But on the off chance that you get f***ed by the legal system because of some power hungry, mouth-breather cop who can't/won't understand that you've done nothing wrong -- or worse, that you're easily provably within the law, but he "believes" that you're not and drags you through the process anyways -- you'll be very happy that you stashed away that old unlocked cell phone, old laptop, change of clothes and cash.
I'm a (legal) firearms owner... up here in Canada, where some previous governments enacted extreme anti-gun legislation, that pretty much means that if I so much as sneeze in a way that a cop doesn't like, I can have my life ruined pretty damned fast (not quite, but really close).  I wouldn't bet against me having an excrement-hitting-the-oscillator stash like this guy does.  ;)
(Note:  I don't mean to imply that all cops are power hungry mouth-breathers intent on destroying the lives of citizens.   Most cops are fundamentally good people and do a great job.  But like every other profession, there ARE bad cops out there, and it's within the realm of possibility that you'll deal with one of them one day.)
If you think that legal costs in a criminal case only start when you've been formally charged, you're grossly misinformed.   At what point you personally decide to donate is one thing, but implying that someone doesn't need a defense fund prior to charges being laid is a bit naive about how the process works.

Drifting a big off topic for NANOG (but hey, that happens every /pi/ days anyways!), but I'll toss this in...
Like every other legal incident, it would be unique to your own situation.  Keep in mind that, should any of the charges you mentioned go to court, the prosecution would have to prove /mens rea/ (intent).  They would have to prove that you intended to cause the drives to be wiped specifically because you did not want them admitted as evidence.
If you weren't even home at the time the warrant was executed, the worst lawyer in the world would be able to argue that you have the system in place to prevent sensitive data from leaving in the event of common theft, and that it's not your fault the police triggered it (and suggest that maybe they should add "scan for an intense EM field" to their standard procedures when dealing with computer equipment :p ).
If you were home at the time (or knew that a warrant was being executed, e.g. if the police show up at your workplace to inform you), things would be a lot dicier.  Actively hitting the "turn on the system" button would definitely be bad news for you. However, simply not turning it off as the officers are walking out the door, well... it was a VERY stressful situation for you, with all the police running all over your house, and you simply forgot about the system until much later (or so your lawyer could argue).
There would definitely be some unhappy people with the situation regardless, and either way you'll be contributing to buying your lawyer a new car.  ;)
Now, having said all that... I'm not sure I'd want to pay the electricity bill for keeping that degausser running... :p

There are plenty of good reasons for self-signed certs -- people stuck running a Microsoft environment might find it might difficult without it, since it's a fundamental feature of Active Directory. ;)   Various F/OSS projects, like OpenVPN, generally recommend self-signed certs as a standard deployment scenario, because it actually provides an extra layer of security -- as the CA, you determine who gets a cert and who doesn't.   The difficulty you'll run into is defining "self-signed".   If you generate your own CA and put the certs in your /etc/ssl directory, it's still "self-signed" (as in you're the one signing the end-use certs), the only difference is that your browser, etc, won't pop up a warning because it's now "trusted".
It's also important to not conflate "encryption" with "chain of trust validation".   There are good reasons to encrypt without really caring who you're talking to.  There are also good reasons to not necessarily trust an arbitrary list of CAs as provided by your SSL stack vendor and provide your own list, as mentioned above.
Two entirely separate issues, IMHO.

You can get single-host certificates issued for free from StartSSL, or for very cheaply (under $10) from low-cost providers like CheapSSL.com.  I've never had a problem having my StartSSL certs verified by anyone.
