These are classed as 'strong password protocols', and include protocols
like SRP (implemented in cyrus sasl I think, but not used commercially
anywhere that I know of - sure cyrus sasl is, but those that use is
typically only support a couple of authentication methods, and SRP isn't
one of them) and PDM (Password Derived Moduli).
They have in common the use of Diffie-Hellman exchange, or slightly
modified versions of it.
I'm not sure how the DH aspect plays into these properties.  These
protocols all exist in an 'augmented' form (except SRP which has no
other form) which adds the property that ownership of the server
database does not facilitate impersonation.  That seems sufficient.
SRP, augmented PDM, both are good and unpatented, but SPEKE claims
dominion over all of them.  Despite the fact that DH-EKE predates it,
and DH is the foundational technology.  Thus, most people think the
patent is silly nonsense, but are unwilling to test it by (say)
including full SRP support in a popular and successful software product.
Of course, my assumptions about there being no such products are exactly
that.  If there are such products I would be very interested to hear
about them.
BTW, in case it isn't obvious, as I wrote this mail I was referencing
the Kaufman, Perlman and Speciner 'Network Security' book for
verification.  I had a close encounter with the politics of this
patent a couple of years ago though, and have directly observed its
chilling effect.

They are heavily patent laden, although untested last time I looked.
This has been discouraging to implementers.
(note, a well-informed and smart person (read 'author of similar
protocol') tells me the patent(s) may well be unsupportable, but no-one
has thus far been willing to test the water.)
