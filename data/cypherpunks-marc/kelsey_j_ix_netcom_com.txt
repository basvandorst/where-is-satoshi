Hmmm.  I agree, but if the attackers chose the right time (while the
plane's on autopilot) to release the gas or whatever, they might have an
hour or two to get through the cockpit door, with no resistance at all from
the now-dead passengers or crew.  Securing a cockpit door in those
circumstances is *much* harder than securing it against someone with a
shorter time to get through, and with the possibility of active resistance
from the other side.  (I seem to recall hearing some pilot comment that he
was very confident of his ability to keep someone from breaking through the
door, just by flying so that it's almost impossible to stay on your feet.
Certainly, trying to use a hacksaw or cutting torch or something wouldn't
be much fun while the pilot did loops or something.)  On the other hand, the pilot or copilot pretty much just have to figure out
something is wrong and indicate this fact to the people on the ground, and
there will be a plane along shortly to shoot them down if necessary.  And I
don't think this kind of gassing attack would work all that smoothly in
practice--some people would be affected before others, due to nonuniformity
in the way air is distributed in the cabin and different levels of
susceptibility.  The combination of a hard-to-break-into cockpit and some kind of response
to prevent these planes being used as low-tech cruise missiles seems like a
win.  Maybe it would make sense to add some kind of remote surveilance of
the cockpit, though I imagine this wouldn't be too popular with pilots, and
they'd definitely need to secure the channel properly.   --John Kelsey, kelsey.j // jkelsey

This whole idea was talked to death many years ago on sci.crypt, and probably before that other places.  The good news is that it's not too hard to come up with a design that lets you encrypt a large hard drive in such a way that there's no way to determine how many "tracks" of secret data are there.  I believe one of Ross Anderson's students did a design for this; it doesn't seem like a really hard problem to solve if you don't mind losing most of your effective disk capacity.  The bad news is that you *really* need to think about your threat model before using it, since there's necessarily no way for you to prove that there no more tracks of secret data.  It takes no imagination at all to think of ways you might end up wishing you *could* convince someone you'd given them the key to all the IMO, the only way to do this kind of thing is to have the data, or at least part of the key, stored remotely.  The remote machine or machines can implement duress codes, limits to the number ot password guesses allowed per day, number of invalid password guesses before the thing just zeros out the key and tells the person making the attempt it has done so, etc.  Trust me, you *want* the server to loudly announce that it will zero the key irretrievably after the tenth bad password....

That's generally true of biometrics.  Unless taking the measurement is so intrusive it's obvious when it's taken (e.g., maybe the geometry of your sinus cavities or some such thing that requires a CAT scan to measure properly), there's no secret.  People constantly seem to get themselves in trouble trying to use biometrics in a system as though they were secret.
The best you can usually do is to make it moderately expensive and difficult to actually copy the biometric in a way that will fool the reader.  But this is really hard.  In fact, making special-purpose devices that are hard to copy or imitate is pretty difficult.  It seems enormously harder to find a hard-to-copy, easy-to-use "token" that just happens to come free with a normal human body.
I think the best way to think about any biometric is as a very cheap, moderately hard to copy identification token.  Think of it like a good ID card that just happens to be very hard to misplace or lend to your friends.

@_subject: Re: An attack on paypal --> secure UI for browsers 
So, have you ever tried doing substantial revisions on a large document that's going back and forth between two or more versions of Word?  It's in MS' interest to get everyone using the same version, so it's not really in their interest to spend great amounts of time debugging their version translation functions.  It shows.
If you need to coordinate working on a big Word document with several other people (e.g., clients or coworkers who are most comfortable with Word), you pretty-much will need to use not just Word, but the same version of Word.  That doesn't need any secure hardware to enforce, just buggy software.  You can sometimes work around this, but it's a pain to do.
Well, let's distinguish between:
a.  The sort of network monopoly situation Microsoft is in, where the world has more-or-less settled on a bunch of their products, and so they can do a lot of irritating things before they actually lose their dominant market position.  (Note that this doesn't mean they are unassailable; Word Perfect and Lotus -123 were once in similarly dominant positions.)
b.  Eventual laws requiring that every new computer contain a secure processing unit to enforce the dictates of the government, the record companies, or whomever else on your computers.
I think a lot of the objection to TCPA is the worry that it will be mandated eventually, and that it will then be used to cement the network monopoly held by MS forever.  And Vinge's description of "ubiquitous governance" comes to mind here--whether it's MS or the US federal government or the UN or the Catholic Church, if someone can put themselves in control of all computer equipment you own in some secure way, they look a heck of a lot like the government.
Sure.  Or you can often translate their documents, or open them with OpenOffice.  I do this when I just need to read and comment on a Word document.  But if you are going to be revising and sending back the document a few times, this will not work--you will lose some formatting, you will probably introduce weird formatting bugs, you may mess up the file format, etc.  It's just not worth the pain.  Though I have a legitimate copy of Word on my machine, when given a choice, I always do everything in ASCII text until the very end, and then paste the text into Word and do formatting last.  But again, this isn't too helpful if it's a document I'm working on with someone else.
Mainframe customers used to put up with this kind of treatment routinely, so it's not impossible.  Whether it will fly these days is an interesting question, but I don't think the answer is obvious.  Someone might ask the same rhetorical question about whether customers would sit still for buggy, insecure software.  But nobody would ask that question these days, as the answer is so painfully obvious.

It seems intuitively like the EDR ought to be about as valuable to the defense as the prosecution, right?  E.g., the prosecutor says "this guy was driving 120 miles an hour down the road while being pursued by the police," but the EDR says he'd never topped 70.  There are creepy privacy implications in there somewhere, but the basic technology seems no more inherently Orwellian than, say, DNA testing--which seems to be a pretty good way of actually locking up the right guy now and then, rather than someone who looks kind-of like the guy who did it, and was seen in the area by an eyewitness and picked out of a police lineup.

In fact, I believe this is the trick that makes it very easy to distinguish between sequences of coin flips that really happen, and ones that are made up by a human.  The human tends to try to make things even out over time.

I believe one of Ross Anderson's students did something like this a few years ago, basically using error-correcting codes with a lot of redundancy.  The basic idea is that you use some kind of massive error correction and use a different sequence of bits with each key, so that you're very unlikely to have enough of your message bits clobbered by another message to make it impossible to decode correctly.  (It seems like there'd be a problem with information leakage about number of channels here, if you had a message encoded in that block of bits, because you would know when you decoded it how often you'd had bits flipped, but maybe they resolved that somehow.)

Well, you're going to have a model for your covertext.  Maybe that's the statistical distribution of low-order bits in the image file, maybe that's the distribution of packet arrival times.  You encode messages in your covertext by making up new covertexts (maybe from existing or old ones) that fit the same model.  If an attacker has no better a model than you do, he can't tell stegoed covertext from unstegoed covertext.  If an attacker has a better model, he may be able to tell the difference.
Let's make this concrete.  Suppose I decide to encode my real message to you in the time I send this e-mail.  If I have 24 hours in which I'm willing to send this message, I can encode one of about 80,000 messages to you, since the timestamp goes down to the second.
Now imagine an attacker who doesn't know anything about me.  He has no reason to be surprised at any time I might be sending messages to you, so to him, this isn't a terrible scheme.
Now imagine an attacker who knows I work a 9-5 job.  He ought to be quite surprised at seeing e-mail from me at 10:30 AM on Friday, because I'm supposed to be in the office then.  He ought to be pretty surprised at seeing e-mail from me at 4 AM, because that will make it hard for me to make it to work in the morning.  He has a better model of what the covertext (the time I send the e-mail) should look like, so he can see a couple of innocent-looking e-mails from me to you with weird timestamps, and have some reason to suspect something interesting is going on.

So, I think that's pretty sound advice, but I don't think any of the top ten reasons for supporting it involve whether Al Qaida will stop attacking us.  Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but our foreign policy ought to be made based on what is in our long-term best interest ("our" meaning American citizens); realistically, terrorist attacks are a fairly small part of that calculation.  For example, we could presumably beat China in a war, but such a war would be enormously more expensive and dangerous than fighting Al Qaida.  If continuing to play world's policeman improves our chances of avoiding war with China, at the cost of bringing about some attacks from Al Qaida, that's a win for us.
Now, I suspect that playing world's policeman does *not* make us less likely to get into really dangerous and expensive war, and often gets us caught up in little wars that could expand into bigger ones.  (The Korean war apparently came relatively close to getting us into a war with China, for example.)  But there's at least some argument to be made about that--for example, by ensuring the security of Japan and Germany, we have avoided having two potentially very well-armed and dangerous opponents wandering around, possibly going on an empire-building spree that would have forced us into a nuclear war with them sooner or later.
Isn't he alleged to have also done the Olympic Park bombing?  (Who knows whether he really did, or whether the FBI just assumed he had so they'd only have one domestic terrorist at large.)
Anyway, my point is that it's never going to be acceptable for the US government to pull out of making decisions about policy within the US.  A campaign of terrorism against abortion clinics, or against liquor stores, or against bookstores, can't be responded to by changes in policy to appease the terrorists without giving up on any kind of a free society.

One interesting property of the lone warriors is that they can't actually make peace.  With large sets of them, there's not only no way to force them to surrender, there's no way to even surrender to them!  The demands of different lone warriors are different.  Because they're not under anyone's authority, you can't negotiate a truce that's worth anything with them.

One interesting property of the lone warriors is that they can't actually make peace.  With large sets of them, there's not only no way to force them to surrender, there's no way to even surrender to them!  The demands of different lone warriors are different.  Because they're not under anyone's authority, you can't negotiate a truce that's worth anything with them.

a.  AQ has worked out that it's cheaper and safer to disrupt life in the US by "chatter" than by actually trying any attacks here, and disrupting holidays is more fun.
b.  There really have been attacks planned, but they've either been foiled actively (e.g., the terrorists got arrested or shot or something before the attack took place) or passively (e.g., the higher alert status, changes to security procedures, etc., have made the terrorists postpone their attacks.
c.  There really isn't much useful information about AQ plans in the available intelligence, and what we're seeing is the intelligence community's priors (in the Bayesian sense; their prior assumptions are swamping the effects of their meager data).

Well, clearly bombing and invading them was an initiation of force, in the most literal sense--we shot first.  But while I can see that individuals have a right that you violate by initiating force against them, I don't see how that can apply to governments, especially governments whose main method of keeping power involves terrorizing their citizens.  Did the Iraqi government have a right to stay in power, or at least not to be invaded?  Where did that right come from?  From the rights of its people, most of whom apparently didn't have a hell of a lot good to say about it?  (That doesn't mean they like *us*, of course.)
In the most morally neutral case, this is like one criminal gang attacking another.  If the Sopprano family invades the Bozini family's turf, takes over their protection rackets, and hunts down their godfather, it could be messy, and it really will be an initiation of force in the most literal sense.  But is this the same kind of "initiation of force" that we normally talk about when, say, a mugger knocks me over the head and takes my laptop and wallet? (And of course, it's not that morally neutral.  It's more like a bunch of vigilantes from the neighborhood next door getting rid of the gang running your neighborhood, for reasons of their own, but probably to your benefit.)
None of this means it made any sense for us to invade Iraq, or that we did it mainly to liberate oppressed Iraqi citizens.  But I think using the same kind of language for interactions between individuals and between governments is a mistake.

Moore's law has continued apace, strong crypto is widely available, but would anyone claim we have more privacy now than in 1990?  Nor is this only because of 9/11 (asymmetric warfare apparently *does* work pretty well, though it's hard to see how that's done anything for the cause of freedom in the US); surveilance cameras, OCR, biometric readers and data mining techniques are all getting cheaper.  The split seems to be that most people lose privacy, while those who really care a lot gain a little privacy, albeit by standing out as obvious people-with-something-to-hide, activists, or cryptographers.  The math behind anonymous payment schemes is well-understood, and processors are fast enough to do signatures and blinding and all the rest pretty painlessly, now.  But e-commerce is still all about credit cards over SSL (on a browser that is manifestly *not* a piece of security software!), if It's ironic.  All the things that seemed like barriers to serious privacy for the masses--Clipper, export controls, the RSA patent, processors barely powerful enough to do serious public key operation before the user lost patience--are either gone or much-diminished.  But we still don't have serious privacy for the masses, or even widespread use of crypto in a way that protects communications privacy.

I think the VoteHere scheme and David Chaum's scheme both claim to solve this problem.  The voting machine gives you a receipt that convinces you (based on other information you get) that your vote was counted as cast, but which doesn't leak any information at all about who you voted for to anyone else.  Anyone can take that receipt, and prove to themselves that your vote was counted (if it was) or was not counted (if it wasn't).  (This is based on attending a presentation of David's scheme at George Washington a few months ago, a conversation I had with a VoteHere guy, and some conversations and documents given to me by each.  I haven't tried to verify the protocols or proofs, but I'm convinced that all this is possible, modulo various assumptions.  There may be a dozen other people doing similar things, that I've simply not heard of.)
The way I understood these schemes, you can see the initial encrypted ballots (they're published), and then there are several rounds of publically verifiable shuffling and decryption by different TTPs.  After the last round of shuffling and decryption, you have raw votes.  So anyone can verify the count, assuming the set of initial encrypted ballots are legitimate.  And anyone can produce a receipt that can be shown to be one of those encrypted ballots, if it was counted.  That doesn't keep someone from stuffing the ballot box, but it does mean that anyone who throws away unfavorable votes is going to leave behind evidence, which can potentially call the whole vote into question.  The way I saw these schemes described, there was no recount capability, but the count was done in a completely public way.
It seems to me that this kind of scheme has a lot of potential for disruption attacks, since one compromised voting machine can be used to call any election into question.  But I could be missing something, as this is really not something I've spent a lot of time on....
I see your point, but there's an awful lot of any voting system that isn't being closely observed by the voters, or that isn't really well-understood by most of them.  It's not so clear to me that the average voter is going to walk away convinced that a voter-verified paper ballot, or a mark-sense ballot, or whatever other thing isn't going to somehow be subject to attack.  Or that if they do walk away convinced, that this has much to do with whether they *should* walk away convinced.
Yep, this is a big issue.  Which is why I think everyone with any sense agrees that we need some kind of independent audit trail, regardless of whether we're doing voting with computers, or with pens for punching out holes.  There are a bunch of ways to do this, one obvious and pretty easy-to-field choice being voter-verified paper ballots.
Huh?  Do you think the same is true of payment systems?  Those also ultimately require some humans to play by the rules, but it sure seems like a well-designed payment system can remove a lot of the ambiguity about who has violated the rules, and can outright prevent other kinds of rule violations.  And it seems to me that this is very similar to the situation with voting.
Touch screen voting (with the audio extensions) has at least one huge advantage over pen-and-paper schemes, because blind people can vote with them.  The VoteHere and Chaum schemes provide other benefits (a lot of kinds of misbehavior by the authorities are prevented by the design, though of course, not *all* possible misbehavior), at various costs in system complexity, dependence on lots of interacting systems that might not be all that reliable, ability to recover from some low level of fraud, etc.  Paper ballots printed behind glass provide a different set of tradeoffs.  And you could design twenty other sets of tradeoffs.  I'm not at all convinced that the way we optimize for best security is to minimize technology.
I agree that it's easy to get carried away by the elegance of your mathematics, or by the really spiffy blinking lights on the computer, and forget the essentials.  But technology and math aren't somehow inherently bad things to introduce to voting systems.  It just has to be done in a way that makes sense, right?
Less subject to vote tampering than the old machines with mechanical counters and levers?  That's not too hard.  Less subject to vote tampering than paper ballots marked by hand, that may be a little more of a challenge.  I think it's more fair to say that the attacks and threats will be different, and that the risk of a class break (work out the details of the attack once, then change votes all over the country) is seriously scary.  But it's sure not clear to me that adding computers to the mix must decrease security, or even must leave it unchanged.

  The "profitably" part is a non-issue when you have black budgets,

This is silly.  They have black budgets, but not infinite ones.  Given their budget (whatever it is), they want to buy the most processing bang for their buck.  I doubt they can do that substantially better than anyone else.  I'd expect them to be really clever at finding tricks to optimize keysearch of various kinds, but not to have better microprocessor technology than the rest of the world.    Bottom line: they're not ahead in tech, but they can make things that
  private-co engineeers only dream of.  DesCrack is a suitcase, get it?
So, then they can break 3-key 3DES with moderate numbers of texts as soon as they can build 2^{56} such suitcases, right?  And power them, and get rid of their waste heat....
  I'll let you speculate on AESCrack :-)
Do the math, and you'll see how implausible 128-bit keysearch is.  Maybe there are better attacks on AES (the algebraic stuff doesn't seem to have gone anywhere, but it still might), but if keysearch is all we have to worry about, and nontrivial quantum computers remain impractical to build, then 128-bit keys are as secure as we're ever likely to need, and 256-bit keys more or less eliminate keysearch of any kind from the list of things we need ever worry about again.

Yep.  This seems like the practical weak link in a lot of uses of cryptography.  It can be made harder in a lot of ways (e.g., upping the iteration count, or doing Abadi's trick of generating a big salt value but not disclosing all of it), but all this ends up with the attacker's extra work linear in the user's extra work.  Of course, if the user chooses good passwords, it's a pretty big linear factor, but it's still linear--I double my iteration count, and the attacker doubles his work, though he's always doing a million times as much work as I am.  The only really good solution is to use some external device to mediate in password->key generation.  But then you've got to make sure that device is always available, or you're unable to get at your data.  And if that device is an online server somewhere, then password encryptions become partly traceable.  --John Kelsey

Okay, but there's a problem:  If you want to mug me personally, you have to show up where I am, catch me unaware, take some personal risk that I'll fight back or shoot you or something, or that a cop will happen by at an inopportune moment, or that there's some surveilance camera you don't know about catching the whole thing on tape.  At the end of that, you've done one mugging, and made maybe $100 or so.  This is why mugging, armed robbery, etc., is basically a crime for people who don't think too far ahead.   If you want to steal anonymous bearer assets from networked computers, you're going to contrive to do a whole lot of it at once, and you're going to have enormous incentives to develop new attacks to do so.  I have to care about attackers everywhere on Earth, and about the most capable getting past my defenses.  It's not like trying to keep random bored teenagers from breaking into your house by putting a proper lock on a properly installed door, it's like trying to keep a team of ex-SEALs, safecrackers, locksmiths, and demolition experts from breaking into your house.  Today, most of what I'm trying to defend myself from online is done as either a kind of hobby (most viruses), or as fairly low-end scams that probably net the criminals reasonable amounts of money, but probably don't make them rich.  Imagine a world where there are a few hundred million dollars in untraceable assets waiting to be stolen, but only on Windows XP boxes with the latest patches, firewalls and scanners installed, and reasonable security settings.  IMO, that's a world where every day is day zero.  All bugs are shallow, given enough qualified eyeballs, and with that kind of money on the table, there would be plenty of eyeballs looking.  And once it's done, several thousand early adopters are out thousands of dollars each.  This isn't much of an advertisement for the payment system.  It's anonymous and based on bearer instruments, so there's no way to run the fraudulent transactions back.  The money's gone, and the attackers are richer, and the next, more demanding round of attacks has been capitalized.  They also have to be able to do something about it.  What would you tell a reasonably bright computer programmer with no particular expertise in security about how to keep a bearer asset as valuable as his car stored securely on a networked computer?  If you can't give him an answer that will really work in a world where these bearer assets are  common, you're just not going to get a widespread bearer payment system working, for the same reason that there's probably nobody jogging with an iPod through random the streets of Sadr City, no matter how careful they're being.

The aspect of this that's generally spooky is not the existence of book entry payment systems, it's the ease with which someone can get credit (in one form or another) in your name, based on information they got from public records and maybe a bit of dumpster diving, some spyware installed on your machine, or a phishing expedition.

I'm pointing out that once you've started justifying acts of terror by people you agree with, it seems to be quite hard to draw any meaningful line between them and Al Qaida.  Now, this causes no problem for me--OBL, Tim McVeigh, the Unabomber, they all look like remorseless murderers to me, and I see the differences between them mainly in terms of how effective and dangerous they are.  I don't know if this was a goal, exactly, but the other thing the 9/11 attacks achieved was to scare the hell out of the power elite in the country, especially the people at the top of government, media, and finance.  That made all kinds of dumb responses (some parts of the Patriot act, Bush's breathtaking claim of the power to lock up citizens without trial, his administration's equally breathtaking claim that he could ignore laws and treaties against torture on his authority, the invasion of Iraq) possible.

I'm still trying to understand the moral theory on which you differentiate hitting the two towers from the Oklaholma City bombing.  McVeigh (not a branch davidian) wanted to strike back at the BATF for the Waco massacre, so he killed a whole bunch of people, a few of whom were BATF employees, but not, as far as I know, anyone directly involved in the decisions that led to all the deaths in Waco.  The 9/11 hijackers wanted to strike at the US for a variety of reasons, probably mostly that we're a big, visible target, but presumably also that we're propping up states like Saudi Arabia.  So they killed a whole bunch of people, most of whom had nothing to do with what they opposed, but surely including people who were doing business with Saudi Arabia and Israel.
If McVeigh had used a sniper rifle to kill the specific BATF agent who called for the raid/media event on the Branch Davidians' compound, I'd still think he deserved to either die or spend his life in prison, but at least I could somehow fathom the moral decision to do what he'd done--like the pro-life terrorists (ah, the irony) who assassinate abortionists.  They need to be locked up, but you can at least see what they were thinking.  Blowing up a building full of random people because a few of them are associated with some action you really disagree with is just outside the realm of the sort of moral decision I can figure out.

None of them has had a trial, few have even had hearings, and many were released as not a threat to us.  (They may still be a threat to everyone else around them.)

I think this bit gets at the heart of why the Islamic fundamentalists are hard to deal with.  For most people I know, some notion of peace and prosperity is the thing we want from our governments.  Different people differ on how to do that (like, whether the government should employ most of the doctors or the teachers),  but that's the kind of goal that makes sense.  And that's largely what the West has to offer.  Not membership in a master race, or a date with destiny, or as vision of yourself as part of a great, centuries-old Jihad, but safe streets, working sewers, functioning markets, and a rising tide that promises to life all boats eventually, so that one day, your poor people, like ours, will be overweight from spending too much time sitting in front of the TV in an air conditioned room.  The Islamic fundamentalists can't offer that.  A country run by these guys is just not going to be in the forefront of technology, its economy will grow slowly, and it's likely to always be close to going to war with some infidels around it.  No peace, not much prosperity, but a lot of capital-P Purpose.  A place in history, a part of the Jihad.  In this sense, it's a lot like Marxism was, back when it had serious adherents; it's a mass movement, like Eric Hoffer talks about.  What Hayek called the liberal order (e.g., working minimal government, liberal democracy, rule of law) can't offer any of that.   It offers safe streets and working sewers and peace and prosperity, but you have to come up with your own purpose.  The irony is that the neocons seemed to be trying to build up a kind of mass movement mentality in the US, which clearly has caught George Bush and his top advisors--this wonderful notion that we're going to go out and civilize these heathens, bring them democracy and free markets, and then they'll stop wanting to be part of crazy mass movements that tell them to strap dynamite to themselves and blow up bus stops full of people.   This seems doomed to fail.  A lot of people in the Middle East clearly want what we're selling, but it doesn't take many suicide bombers to make that sort of thing break down.

Well, the question is, what ought they to be doing with it.  Invading Iraq to build a democracy there, in hopes of somehow fixing the root causes of terrorism (as similarly goofy idealists on the left once thought they could do for crime in the US), looks like a waste of time and money.  I suspect we're causing ourselves more problems, as Iraq is not only a place where terrorists can go to attack the US and be attacked by us in turn, it's also a place where there are lots of people learning the basic skills of being a terrorist, gaining some experience in doing so, etc.  Do you think we're going to kill all of those people?  Do you think they'll all abandon terrorist tactics when things quiet down in Iraq?  I know the Republican line these days is that we're safer because the bad guys are all shooting at Marines in Iraq, rather than at civilians in Des Moines.  But that only makes sense if we don't end up with a much bigger problem later, as a result.

Why is one of these people more obviously right than the others?  [I know you weren't agreeing with the quoted statement either.]
In practice, Alice's strategy has almost no impact on the result--nothing I did as a Maryland voter could have given Bush fewer electoral votes than he already got, and that's true almost everywhere for an individual voter.  This is especially true if you're an individual voter whose major issues are just not very important to most other voters.  Kerry spent essentially no time talking about the creepy implications of the Jose Padilla case (isn't he still being held incommunicado, pending filing in the right district?), or the US government's use of torture in the war on terror despite treaties and the basic obligations of civilized people not to do that crap.  I see little indication that Kerry would have disclaimed the power to do those things, had the vote swung a couple percentage points the other way.
Bob's strategy has more going for it, but it comes down to a tradeoff between alternate uses of your time.  You could devote your time to the Bush or Kerry or Badnarik campaigns, or you could improve your ability to survive whatever ugliness may come in other ways--maybe by making more money and banking it against future problems, or improving your standing in your field, so you're likely to be employable even in a massive post-terror-attack recession.

If we want to fight high-tech wars like the invasion of Iraq, lots of conscript troops aren't that useful.  If we want to occupy places like Iraq, we need people to do the occupying, and it's clear that there's some strain on our forces now.  Conscript troops might very well be useful for that kind of work.  Suppose we invade and occupy Iran next.  Where will the soldiers needed to hold down occupied territory come from?  Suppose we follow up with Syria, which is surely about as repressive and nasty a place as Saddam's Iraq.  Three things are very clear about the current situation:
a.  A lot of people are finding out that their military obligations are going to be longer and much less pleasant than they expected.  This is going to have a big impact on recruiting in the future.
b.  If we just want to hold down what we've got, we have enough troops to do it, but if we want to really go on a democratizing bender in the Middle East, we'll need more troops.  c.  It's not at all clear we won't be taking some action against Iran in the next year.  Hopefully, that won't involve invading them, but it could.

Maybe so.  It's clearly added cost to the attackers--they have to select not just the subset of volunteers willing to blow themselves up on the plane, but the subset of *those* who can also keep cool under rapid-fire questioning of their cover story.  The attackers probably have to either spend a lot of time rehearsing their cover stories, or have to keep their cover stories very close to their actual lives and interests, which makes profiling easier.  Both of these cut way down on the total pool of attackers available.  My assumption is that national intelligence agencies can probably afford to do this--they can probably filter through a lot more possible candidates to get field agents who can handle a cover story well, for example, since they can hire openly, rather than quietly recruiting from madrassa students or something.  Their training facilities can be centralized and stay in one place, rather than being a camp in the desert somewhere that has to be abandoned frequently, and they can develop a lot of expertise in training people to survive intensive questioning without fumbling their cover story.

Maybe, maybe not.  The thing I always find interesting and annoying about Tim May's posts is that he's sometimes making really clearly thought out, intelligent points, and other times spewing out nonsense so crazy you can't believe it's coming from the same person.  It's also clear he's often yanking peoples' chains, often by saying the most offensive thing he can think of.  But once in awhile, even amidst the crazy rantings about useless eaters and ovens, he'll toss out something that shows some deep, coherent thought about some issue in a new and fascinating direction.

They're going to have the same problems as the rest of us using strong cryptography--configuration and usability problems, key management hassles, incompatibilities between versions and programs, etc.  They have to do this with no central authority, no single support line or person who can reliably start things up and help them, in a basically decentralized way.  The cypherpunkish idea of a decentralized conspiracy using strong crypto only works if either the tools are a lot easier to use, or if the conspiracy is made up of cryptographically sophisticated people.  AQ is presumably made up of people who know a lot about the Koran, and probably a lot about day-to-day operational security against the Pakistani or Indonesian secret police, but there's not much reason to think they are very sophisticated about cryptography.  If you can't get most computer-literate people you know to use PGP to send you e-mail, how well is it going to work to do with a bunch of random jihadis?

Maybe, but I think it would be very hard to write a general-purpose stego detector, without knowing the techniques used for encoding the message.  And if you know the distribution of your cover channel as well as your attacker, or can generate lots of values from that distribution even if you can'd describe it, you can encode messages in a way that provably can't be detected, down to the quality of your random number generator and the difficulty of guessing your key.  I imagine this as something much like a virus scanner.  Look for known stego programs, and also for signatures of known stegp programs.  Really good programs might be impossible to find without doing, say, a password search.  But it's worth noting that AQ has to do key management just like the rest of us, and that's hard when you are communicating with a lot of different people.  If your stego is password-protected, some terrorist's laptop is going to have a post-it note on the screen with the password.  --John Kelsey

But the real thing they needed to know was "there can be hidden information in files that look innocent" and what they need to do to find that hidden information.  I expect the answer to that will involve either shipping it off to some expert at the FBI (who will have to do some serious flow control, or he'll be receiving copies of all the video games on every small-time drug dealer's computer), or running some tools to look for the hidden data.  It's not like you're going to expect a random detective to learn how to cryptanalyze stego schemes, anymore than you're going to expect him to learn how to check for DNA matches in a lab.  He'll need to have some notion of how the technology works, and some rules of thumb for how to handle the evidence to keep from tainting it, and that's about it.

But that's a common enough situation that the questioners are going to be ready for it.  And I bet a lot of the point of their questioning is just to see if they detect signs of stress where they expect to.  If you are a smart person who does something like this 20 times a day, you'll soon get a really good feel for when something odd is going on.  Also, any kind of in-depth questioning is likely to uncover a lot of fraudulent claims.  If I say I'm a chemical engineer, it's not going to take much depth of knowledge for the questioner to find out I don't know things any chemical engineer would know, for example.  (It wouldn't be hard to come up with some computerized system for pulling up lists of questions like this.  Like, someone says he's Catholic, and you ask him who was born without sin as a direct result of the immaculate conception, or ask him to say a Hail Mary.)  So this might force you to tell more of the truth, which makes it easier to profile you.  And this is all physical / procedural security.  You're not building an unclimbable wall, you're building lots of challenging speedbumps.  No doubt a real intelligence agent would be good at getting through this kind of screening, but that doesn't mean most of the people who want to blow up planes would be any good at it!

Why would this be a surprise?  This is surely the way it is with most people, hence the famous old quote about "...and when they came for me, there was no one left to complain."  I wonder how long it will take 'till TSA adops some kind of internal policing policies with some teeth, to deal with the claims about women being felt up, people being turned away from planes for reading the wrong book, or whatever.  Probably sometime after a successful lawsuit costs them a few million dollars, alas.

I've heard this from other people, too--some in reasonably good positions to know how such things were reported.  And there's surely some ambiguity between fatal accidents caused by doing something really stupid and intentional suicides.

The best defense would seem to be a population with a lot of TVs and radios.  At least after the first tsunami hit, the news would quickly spread, and there were several hours between when the waves arrived at different shores.  (And a 9.0 earthquake on the seafloor, or even a 7.0 earthquake on the seafloor, is a rare enough event that it's not crazy to at least issue a "stay off the beach" kind of warning.)  My first take on this is that it's an example of the many ways that it's better to be in a rich country than a poor one.  Major natural disasters are a lot bloodier in poor countries, for lots of infrastructure reasons (good communications to get out the warning, good roads to evacuate on, resources available for disaster planning long before the disaster hits, building codes or best practices that require some resistance to known disasters, etc.).

Interesting questions:  How hard is it for someone to actually hit an airplane with a rifle bullet?  How often do airplane maintenance people notice bulletholes?  My understanding is that a single bullethole in a plane is not likely to do anything serious to its operation--the hole isn't big enough to depressurize the cabin of a big plane, and unless it hits some critical bits of the plane, it's not going to cause mechanical problems.   I don't think the bigger .50 round would fundamentally change that.  So this could be one of those things that just happens from time to time, without getting much press.  (Most people have never heard of phantom controllers either, but they're a real phenomenon, and they seem at least as dangerous as some nut with a rifle taking potshots at landing planes.)   --John

I just wonder what the false negative rates are.  Seem like a gun that has a 1% chance of refusing to fire when you *really need it* might not be worth all that much.  Similarly, one that you can't get to work if you've got a band-aid on your finger, or a cut on your hand, or whatever, loses a lot of its value.  On the other hand, a gun that can't be made to go off by your toddler is a pretty huge win, assuming you're willing to trust the technology, but a 90% accuracy level sounds to me like 10% of the time, your three year old can, in fact, cause the thing to go off.  That's not worth much, but maybe they'll get it better.   And the "suspect struggles with cop, gets gun, and shoots cop" problem would definitely be helped by a guy that wouldn't go off for 90% of attackers.
