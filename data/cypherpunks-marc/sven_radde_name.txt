No matter what size the data is that you want to encrypt/sign, the size

The actual "bulk" data processing is done by a symmetric algorithm /
hash function. You only encrypt the key to the symmetric algorithm /
sign the hash value. Both are typically 256bit or smaller.
In fact, the larger the data you want to process, the *smaller* the
impact of a larger key is. (If it takes minutes to hash a few gigabytes,
it doesn't matter if signing the hash takes 10, 100 or 1000 milliseconds.)
Using email actually is something like the "worst case" for large public
You may want to do some research on "hybrid" cryptosystems for more
thorough information.
