For more specifics from Paul Baran himself, you may read his interview with Stewart Brand. Lots of good stuff circa late 50s - early 60s.
one fun excerpt, re: asking the phone co to build a packet switch:
SB: How seriously did AT&T look at the proposal?
PB: The response was most interesting. The story I tell is of the time I went over to AT&T headquarters - one of many, many times - and there's a group of old graybeards. I start describing how this works. One stops me and says, "Wait a minute, son. Are you trying to tell us that you open the switch up in the middle of the conversation?" I say, "Yes." His eyeballs roll as he looks at his associates and shakes his head. We just weren't on the same wavelength.
Paul's memory is backed up by his meticulous records. I worked at Com21 1997-2K and heard similar recounts from Paul over Com21 BBQ lunches at the company's Tasman site. I wished for a while he'd write a history but came to understand he's always been a doer not a historian.
