Now That It's in the Broadband Game, Google Flip-Flops on Network Neutrality
By Ryan Singel
1:55 PM
In a dramatic about-face on a key internet issue yesterday, Google told
the FCC that the network neutrality rules Google once championed
don't give citizens the right to run servers on their home broadband
connections, and that the Google Fiber network is perfectly within its
rights to prohibit customers from attaching the legal devices of their
choice to its network.
At issue is Google Fiber's Terms of Service, which contains a broad
prohibition against customers attaching "servers" to its ultrafast 1
Gbps network in Kansas City.
Google wants to ban the use of servers because it plans to offer a
business class offering in the future.

In the case of the much-ballyhooed inadvertent sabotaging of the RNG in
the Debian/Ubuntu OpenSSL package[1], I think many commentators don't
sufficiently appreciate just how bad the spaghetti-code problem in
upstream OpenSSL is.  Those who ascribe malice to Kurt Roeckx for his
good-faith effort to fix truly messed-up C code are being, IMO, a bit
idiotic and are missing the real problem entirely.  [1] Do not Cc: anyone else on mail sent to this list.  The list server is set for maximum one recipient.

Long discussion is possible here, which I must demur on.  A couple of
points, though:
1.  Article is somewhat vague on technological specifics.  But:
2.  Some of the specifics are that     (a) '[Flurry's] tracking software appears on the phone automatically     when people download those apps.'  Well, Don't Do That, Then.      (b)  '[Drawbridge] has partnerships with various online publishers
    and ad exchanges' which send 'a notification every time a user
    visits a Web site or mobile app' and identifies a user but not     his/her name by spotting behavioural patterns across multiple     devices.  Sounds pretty fallible, and I think it rather more likely
    that most of what data matching they are able to do come from     matching data voluntarily granted by the user.
Also, I notice that it doesn't work particularly well against my browsing patterns in multiple locations.  To the extent I'm not able to
block Web ads, I'm not seeing effective tailoring.

If you don't believe in smartphones lacking Cyanogenmod, they can't hurt
(Mind you, Cyanogenmod is just a good place to start.)

I'm just guessing that these data are being probed via the CSS
 feature somehow(?).  Panopticlick is unable to query
System Fonts data from my system, and I'm pretty sure it's because I
have NoScript's 'Forbid  control enabled (Preferences,

Proper use of NoScript is the single most effective measure to reduce
the ability of Web sites to collect and abuse that information.  That's
because JavaScript is really the key user-side tool that gets abused in
various ways, and is the glue that lets tracking firms reach a variety
of user-side datastores.

very far with my browser.  I.e., it gets nothing.)

Yes, it is.
Unfortunately, following the main advice of
 results in Firefox
being somewhat _more_ fingerprintable.
If I set User-Agent to    Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)
...instead of to    W3C standards are important. Stop f---ing obsessing over user-agent already.
...I get a result of 'only one in 24,208 browsers have the same
fingerprint as yours' / 'your browser has a fingerprint that conveys
14.56 bits of identifying information'.
I'm thinking that operating a local proxy that screws with the data that fingerprinting relies on, and that changes it at semi-random intervals,
might be a good solution.
