US Banks Hacked in State-Sponsored Iranian Attacks, Officials Say
   By:  [30]Liviu  Arsene  | comment : [31]0 | January 09, 2013 |  Posted
   in: [32]Industry News
   Recent denial of service attacks on US banks are believed to have been
   triggered by state-sponsored actions lead by Iran.
   The  US  government  firmly  believes  the  attacks  are Iran's way of
   retaliating  against  cyber-attacks  led  by the United States against
   Iranian  power  plants  and  nuclear  facilities, according to private
   security experts.
   The  strained  relationship  between the two countries may have caused
   Iran  to  wage  denial  of service attacks on Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan
   Chase,  Bank  of America, Citigroup, and HSBC, under the pretense of a
   controversial video of the Prophet Mohamed, released on YouTube months
   back, the experts said.
   Flooding  the bank's websites with traffic that peaked at 70 gigabits,
   security  experts  believe  that  data centers and cloud services were
   hacked and used to carry out such overwhelming denial of service.
   "The  amount of bandwidth that is flooding the websites is very large,
   much  larger  than  in  other  attacks, and in a sense unprecedented,"
   [33]said  chief  executive of private security firm CrowdStrike Dmitri
   Alperovitch.
   With  no  financial  data  lost  or stolen during the attacks, experts
   believe  the  operation was meant to disrupt normal functioning rather
   than steal customer personal information and bank account credentials.
   However, they are in awe of the scale and complexity of the attacks.
   "The scale, the scope and the effectiveness of these attacks have been
   unprecedented,"  said  Carl  Herberger, [34]vice president of security
   solutions  at  the  Radware  security  firm investigating the attacks.
   "There  have  never  been  this many financial institutions under this
   much duress."
   With  the  Iranian  group  "cyber  fighters  of  Izz ad-din Al qassam"
   claiming responsibility and threatening to continue attacking other US
   institutions,  [35]security  experts  predict  that such sophisticated
   DDoS methods are likely to increase in efficiency and frequency during
   2013.

John McAfee says he led cyber spy ops in Belize
   [2]Danielle Walker
   January 07 2013
   John McAfee may have [3]escaped the legal woes that trailed him in
   Central America, but the tales of his international escapades continue
   with the anti-virus company founder now saying he [4]doled out dozens
   of infected laptops to spy on Belize officials.
   In a Thursday post published on his blog, the 67-year-old McAfee
   detailed an alleged espionage operation he carried out to find "hard
   proof of corruption at a high level" in the country. The scheme
   consisted of 75 laptops installed with espionage malware capable of
   logging keystrokes and hijacking users' microphones and cameras.
   "I began giving these [laptops] away as presents to select people -
   government employees, police officers, cabinet ministers' assistants,
   girlfriends of powerful men, boyfriends of powerful women," McAfee
   wrote.
   "I hired four trusted people full-time to monitor the text files and
   provide myself with the subsequent passwords for everyone's email,
   Facebook, private message boards and other passworded accounts," he
   continued. "The keystroke monitoring continued after password
   collection, in order to document text input that would later be
   deleted. So nothing was missed."
   McAfee's hired "operatives" consisted of 23 women and six men meant to
   help obtain information from Belize officials or people of influence
   in the country. According to McAfee, who founded anti-virus company
   McAfee in 1989 and later sold his stake in 1994, the aim of his spy
   operation may have been laced with revenge, but he ultimately
   explained that he did it for the lulz - if it was done at all.
   "Much of my life is a mystery to me," McAfee said in his blog.
   "Suffice it to say: I just did it because I could."
   A dose of revenge against the Belize government may serve as a larger
   motive than McAfee puts on, however, as his reported conflicts with
   the country's law enforcement date back to late last April [5]when he
   claims his research facility was raided by police, who arrested him,
   killed his dog and took his passport.
   Less than a month ago, [6]McAfee returned to the United States by way
   of Miami following his deportation from Guatemala, where he had been
   taken into custody on suspicion of illegally entering the country.
   McAfee entered Guatemala on the run from Belize police, who for
   several weeks sought him for questioning about the murder of his
   former neighbor and American expatriate Gregory Faull.

Oh I see. Using L4 makes sense then. But, if concern goes as far as
files prepared with hostile intent, I again mused myself once (what a
muser I am) with idea of filtering this stuff through
software/converter running on non-386 emulator, like PDP-10 (simh or
something, running TOPS-* is optional), vax (again simh, some modern
bsd should fit) or even S/380 (modified Hercules emulator, modern
variation on S360 mainframe, hobby project, gnu software ported to
MVS/380 which itself descends from one commercial mainframe os, which
at one point of time became public domain - if memory serves, of
Since those are all musings and no hard work, I cannot claim any kind
of success or if this makes any sense or not at all. Seems doable,
requires time and reading some old manuals written on typewriter and
scanned, and the font is ugly and scales poorly on 6'' ebook reader...

USB condom, great name :-).
Last time I amused myself with such idea (say, few months ago), I
ended up reading specs of stm32f4 family of single board
microcontrollers, mostly because my local shop sells them. They have
like 1MB of flash, my fav has 192kB of ram (not sure, in one piece or
banks? and yes, it's kilo-bytes, not kilo-bits, according to web
page), I guess they have enough io pins to solder usb and/or ether
connectors to them. Plus, ARM Cortex-M cpu  MHz. Very very cute,
for me.
It's a bit of overkill but I really dislike boards with 512 bytes of
ram (what kind of compiler could I fit into this? binary lambda self
interpreter, maybe, cool, but what else besides it - and how much
could I use it for computing rather than led blinking, although leds
could make it look sexier).
Also, I myself would not use L4. No bad feelings about it but, sounds
a bit too huge for this task, meybe? Since I don't know too much about
all this stuff, I guess I'd start with C or Forth on bare metal. I had
not enough time to make sure I could develop for it using Linux/BSD,
since other OSes are no-no.

Exactly! The woman in original post was dealing with small brother,
which is very different to dancing with big bro (despite some people
making claims and noises like it was the very "big bro" himself -
maybe not on this list, I'm not sure, I don't trace so much "who what
and where").
My point was, she could play the "nuissance" and "strangeness" to her
advantage. Especially if she lived in some part of the world where
suing is not so customary but the law still says "in dubio pro reo" -
in case of doubt, give ear to the accused. She decided to milk dollars
from the fat cow, which is probably ok, too - I only barely know the
case as it was described in the news.

Could they find out without stalking that she left work phone at home
and went away? Was she supposed to be available 24/7? If not, is it
legal to spy on worker after work hours and out of workplace (sure,
some agencies may have it in the job contract, explicit or not, but
other employers?).
Oh, btw. Can she be punished if she forgot to charge her phone (say,
can she be punished for being tired after work hours)? Can she be
punished if after work she fell asleep in bath / made love / was
learning Japanese / playing drums and didn't hear the ring (in case
they wanted to check if she's with her phone)?
Sure, it may look strange if one day she plays drums, another day
makes love and yet another saws trees to build a DIY coffee table. But
so what?

Both your asses are wrong. Here is what my brain says: given that vast
majority of current wave are lone males, I expect their families are
going to join them in short time - or ASAP?, because they sit in
refugee camps out of Europe and the camps are sometimes (often?)
underfunded (funds ran out?). So the target is going to be few
millions, plus minus few more. Depends how big families are, on
average. If we assume 1 (lone male) +1 (mother) +(2+n) children +(0+x)
(close relatives we cannot leave behind) then the number starts from 3
millions and there is not too many ways I can think of to make it
Then, if they all are successfully accomodated, expect another
wave. Actually, expect it anyway.
All those new people might be a problem or may be not. At the moment
it seems that so called institutions are caught with their pants down,
so any problem gets exacerbated. For example, is there any kind of
preparation in advance to give few millions kids decent education once
they get here? Otherwise, in twenty years there will be few millions
of undereducated very angry young ready for anything baaad baaad
jobless illiterate aliens.
As of possible furrorists, they are already here so it is too late to
close the doors. Actually, it seems that furrorists are recruited from
EU-born youth, so defending doors is going to be a bit futile, like
few decades too late futile.
Now, sure this is offtopic, so more to the subject. I need some help
from you guys. I need to do me a cypherpunk hairdo. So, should I stick
some Intel chips into my red mohawk? How many? Is it ok to use old
cheap Pentiums or should I only go with Core 2? Or maybe I should
stick a bunch of resistors into the mohawk, or maybe even some nixie
lamps - but I wouldn't like to look too old, so maybe ARM chips will
be this year's chic?  Is it ok to decorate one of my cheeks with
Enigma-encoded text? How about AES? And another problem: I would like
to cut off about 4cm of ethernet cord, with a plug and stick it into
my nose so that plug shows up from the hole. But I would also like to
glue BT dongle to my other cheek. And I feel that if I do both I will
be looked down even by cypherpunks. So what should I choose? I am so
No need to hurry up with advice, however. I need to grow some hairs to
make mohawk from it. Or maybe I will be ok staying with my current
crew cut and sticking some microSDs on it, plug ends up, usb hub glued
to my forehead, rot13 in perl on my cheeks? Please help.
Now, ok. I was joking. In fact if I ever have red mohawk, I will
probably glue single board computer (not Arduino, they are too nice
for me) with some leds, 2000mAh AA, blinking random numbers based on
GPS pos, time, temp and noise. So I do not really seek for advice on
my future c-punk hairdo, but of course constructive thoughts are

Looks nice. I guess you have your reason to make such choices and
perhaps I will try it myself one day. For now however, and in my case,
emacs does the job (keeping some activity log/record, notes, maybe
todo lists, maybe pieces of code - it seems there are some extremely
cool things possible when mixing code into org) so I tend to avoid
"more advanced" stuff [1]. I think it is possible to edit some (other)
wiki with org-mode and send content to it without needing a browser,
which would be huge plus for me. And if I was in need of wiki then
maybe I would look for something which does not require Javascript (as
Tiddly seems to, but I only glanced over few pages and into one zip).
YMMV, of course.
[1] Well, ok, if I see something as more advanced, I would at least
try to include it into my toolbox etc etc. My current needs are such
that emacs (and elisp) appear to be more advanced (compared to browser
and JS). But I have no intent to evangelize people about it.

@_subject: Re: "The West" - an absolute disgrace to Humanity! 
I guess Russia is no longer powerful enough to openly break treaties
it signed:
   "The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances refers to three
   identical political agreements signed in Budapest, Hungary on 5
   December 1994, providing security assurances by its signatories
   relating to Belarus', Kazakhstan's and Ukraine's accession to the
   Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Memorandum
   was originally signed by three nuclear powers, the Russian
   Federation, the United States of America, and the United
   Kingdom. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual
   assurances in separate documents.
   The memorandum included security assurances against threats or use
   of force against the territorial integrity or political
   independence of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan."
In light of this act, if I was responsible for Russian politics, and I
received a plea to join Russia by a foreign party belonging to country
which integrity I myself guaranteed - such a plea would smell rather
fishy to me. Unless, of course, I predicted great bonuses if I agree
and let them join me. Never mind that right now there is huge loss of
money for Russia, they will replenish their finances in a future,
This works the other way too. How about people who want to defend
their families, children, houses and friends from living in Russia?
And I was so certain that daesh had been financed by some wealthy
people from Near East.
Some people will believe just anything.
Oh, do you mean you know/learn Russian? Because this is the best way
to read Russian propaganda. Try to be like Aleksandr, who (I guess)
already knows Russian and learned English, so he can read the
propaganda from both sources without having to count on strangers'
good will and faithfulness.
Actually, do not limit yourself to mere propaganda. It would have been
so cheap, you know. Russian culture is vast and rich. Try it. Some
names to explore, if you need a starter: Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Mikhail
Sholokhov, Isaac Babel, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Osip Mandelstam,
Mikhail Bulgakov, Varlam Shalamov. Some of them you can get for free,
from wikisources and other places. Even more of their works you can
find if you can read them from Russian wikisources.
I would say that cages made of barbed wire convert humans to
animals. So if I can choose, may I stay in my silver cage, please? It
does not really have to be golden one.
From "Cancer Ward" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, as given on wikipedia [
 ]:
(start quote)
   The most confusing thing about the imprisoned animals was that even
   supposing Oleg took their side and had the power, he would still
   not want to break into the cages and liberate them. This was
   because, deprived of their home surroundings, they had lost the
   idea of rational freedom. It would only make things harder for
   them, suddenly to set them free.
   This was the odd way Kostoglotov reasoned. His brain was so twisted
   that he could no longer see things simply and dispassionately.
   Whatever he experienced from now on, there would always be this
   shadow, this grey spectre, this subterranean rumbling from the
   past.

   Russians Rewrite History to Slur Ukraine Over War
   Simon Shuster / Moscow     Oct. 29, 2014
(quotations start here)
   Vladimir Putin has turned the idea of fascism into a political
   tool, and now Russian historians are adapting to the Kremlin line
   The trio of German historians, as well as a handful of their
   colleagues from Eastern Europe, flew into Moscow last week for what
   they thought would be a conference on the history of Nazi war
   crimes. It was the fifth in a series of international summits held
   every other year since 2006, first in Berlin and Cologne, then in
   Slovakia and Belarus, to keep alive the memory of the towns and
   villages destroyed during World War II. But the German co-chairman
   of the conference, Sven Borsche, began to feel that something was
   amiss in Moscow as soon as he met his Russian hosts. âAll they
   wanted to talk about was the conflict in Ukraine,â he says.
   Even without the simultaneous translations provided for the foreign
   guests, they would have gotten the political message. The
   photographs shown by several of the Russian speakers put the
   atrocities of the Nazi SS right alongside pictures from the current
   war in eastern Ukraine. There is not much difference, the Russian
   historians suggested, between the actions of the Ukrainian military
   in its war against separatist rebels and the atrocities that
   Hitlerâs forces committed during World War II.
   This rhetoricâcalling it an argument would overstate its relation
   to factsâhas recently come into vogue among Russian
   historians. Under their interpretation of history, the struggle
   that began with the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941
   continues for Russia today, in a direct line through the
   generations, with the conflict in Ukraine. That is the connection
   President Vladimir Putin first presented to the Russian people in
   March, when he sent his troops to invade and annex the Ukrainian
   region of Crimea. The Russian-speaking residents of that peninsula,
   he said in a speech on the day of the annexation, need Russiaâs
   protection from Ukraineâs new leaders, whom he referred to as
   âneo-Nazis and anti-Semites.â Ukraineâs ensuing war to prevent
   Russia from seizing any more of its territory has likewise been
   branded a fascist campaign against ethnic Russians.
   As these speeches were translated for the foreign delegates,
   including guests from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, their faces
   turned gradually from confusion to disgust. Joerg Morre, the
   director of Berlinâs Karlhorst Museum, which focuses on the history
   of the eastern front in World War II, began to fidget in his
   seat. âI mean, to show the photographs of the Second World War and
   then switch in the next slide to whatâs happening in Ukraine,â
   Morre told me during a break in the conference, âNo way is that
   right. Now way!â Borsche, the co-chairman, agreed with him: âItâs
   polemical!â he said.
   As the conference drew to a close, the two of them decided to voice
   their objections. Morre, springing from his seat, took hold of the
   microphone and told the hall that he did not agree with the final
   declaration of the conference, which had been written by its
   Russian organizers. Specifically, he took issue with the clause
   that declared, âOur generation is facing the task to deter [the]
   revival of Fascism and Nazism,â a thinly veiled reference to
   Ukraine, the German delegates felt. âIt has become clear that we
   have different views on what fascism means today,â Morre told the
   hall in nearly perfect Russian. âYour point of view is not mine. So
   I call for this part of the resolution to be removed,â he added. âI
   do not want to sign it, and I am not the only one.â
   After some noisy debate, the delegates agreed to put the matter to
   a vote. Practically all of the foreign participants raised their
   hands in favor of deleting the reference to a ârevivalâ of European
   fascism. All of the Russian participants, including a large group
   of high school students who had been herded into the auditorium
   about 15 minutes earlier, had the clear majority in voting to leave
   the text of the declaration unchanged. So the hosts of the
   conference won outâa small but telling victory for the cause of
   Russian revisionism.
   Outside the hall, Borsche seemed at a loss for words as he waited
   in the coat-check line. He had served as one of the initiators of
   the conference and its co-chairman, flying in from Germany for the
   occasion to discuss a shared history of suffering during World War
   II. But he says he had no idea that his Russian colleagues would
   use it as a chance to promote their political agenda against
   Ukraine. âThatâs not correct,â he told me. If there is some lesson
   to be learned from the experience, itâs a familiar one, he said:
   âThe more people are convinced of their own opinion, the more they
   become estranged from other opinions. Thatâs a real difficult
   problem.â And as Russia sets out to redefine what Nazism means, it
   is a problem that Western historians will somehow have to face.
(quotations end here)
I can only imagine when people find out about this, they will run like
hares and mad cows straight to non-western countries. Spread the word,
man. Also, buy your tickets while you can, before the mad crowd
prevents you from running away from this horrible place. Even better,
once you buy tickets, use them asap, go to your destination, meet your
dreams. Do not forget to drop few words to the list, so other lost
souls know what to expect outside.

If so, then you are absolved. Go and sin some more :-)

Maybe masters sometimes do the right thing, and if they seem not to,
this might still be for the pupil's good?
Perhaps it depends on master and his/her objectives. Does the master
care about pleasing the master or does the master care about following
the path? Is the path important enough to destroy work of poor
student? Should the poor student make proper backups? Can Buddha's
nature be restored from a backup? Can it be stored there first? Which
one tape has more Buddha on it, the one with backup of formatted drive
or the one that have been laid over degausser for a year?

If you do not mind, it could be nice to write names of countries in
consistent manner. Either as "US", "Russia", "Finland" and "Poland" -
or as "us", "russia", "finland" and "poland".

Those who have ever had such a problem, try new model of master which
sports generational garbage collection. I have read they can do it in
a blink nowadays, without anybody noticing anything, unless they were
looking very carefully for signs.

Myself, as a general rule, I do not killfile or filter my mbox. I only
skip over. But I admit I have read some messages from Zenaan, because
why not and subjects were intriguing...

Insulting? Why, not. I understand that mingling those parts of
language which are related to computers indicates that the zoo has
been taken over by animals. Some are amicable. Some are
malevolent. Most would not mind to grow influence at your expense.

I think it is easier to bear humans when one learns to make jokes
about it.
Come to think about this: we are crazy funny. Like wearing garrota
24/7 because celebrity said so, and buying it for one's own money.
