Would you be interested in exchanging links between our sites?
I noticed that your site is the type of quality web-site containing travel information or services that we would be interested in linking to.
If you are interested, please reply to this email and I will be happy to discuss our link exchange requirements.
Wishing you a great day and hope to hear from you soon.
