@_subject: Fwd: is truecrypt dead? 
Is anyone aware of what is happening to truecrypt project?
from their site:
"The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft
terminated support of Windows XP. Windows 8/7/Vista and later offer
integrated support for encrypted disks and virtual disk images. Such
integrated support is also available on other platforms (click here for
more information). You should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to
encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform."
