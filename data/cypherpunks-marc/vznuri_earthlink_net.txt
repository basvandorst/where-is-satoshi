Washington Plans Unprecedented Camera Network
February 13, 2002
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington police are building what will be the nation=
's biggest network of surveillance cameras to monitor shopping areas, stree=
ts, monuments and other public places in the U.S. capital, a move that worr=
ies civil liberties groups, The Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday.
The system would eventually include hundreds of cameras, linking existing d=
evices in Metro mass transit stations, public schools and traffic intersect=
ions to new digital cameras mounted to watch over neighborhoods and shoppin=
g districts, the Journal said.=20
"In the context of Sept. 11, we have no choice but to accept greater use of=
 this technology," Stephen Gaffigan, the head of the police department proj=
ect, told the Journal.=20
He said city officials had studied the British surveillance system, which h=
as more than 2 million cameras throughout the country, and were "intrigued =
by that model."=20
One of the first uses of police surveillance cameras in Washington was Apri=
l 2000, when authorities set up a network to monitor protests during a meet=
ing of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the newspaper said.=
On Tuesday morning, in response to the latest terror alert issued by the Ju=
stice Department, police activated a $7 million command center that was fir=
st used on Sept. 11. The command center, which has dozens of video stations=
 for monitoring cameras, will remain in use until federal officials end the=
 alert, the Journal reported.=20
Cameras installed by the police have been programmed to scan public areas a=
utomatically, and officers can take over manual control if they want to exa=
mine something more closely.=20
The system currently does not permit an automated match between a face in t=
he crowd and a computerized photo of a suspect, the Journal said. Gaffigan =
said officials were looking at the technology but had not decided whether t=
o use it.=20
Eventually, images will be viewable on computers already installed in most =
of the city's 1,000 squad cars, the Journal said.=20
The Journal said the plans for Washington went far beyond what was in use i=
n other U.S. cities, a development that worries civil liberties advocates.=
Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union =
in New York, noted there were few legal restrictions of video surveillance =
of public streets. But he said that by setting up a "central point of surve=
illance," it becomes likely that "the cameras will be more frequently used =
and more frequently abused."=20
"You are building in a surveillance infrastructure, and how it's used now i=
s not likely how it's going to be used two years from now or five years fro=
m now," he told the Journal.

RaiseTheFist.com Leader Raided By 25 Heavily-Armed Agents
LOS ANGELES - Heavily armed with high-powered machine guns, shot guns, and hand guns, the FBI, Secret Service, and Los Angeles Police Department sorounded the founder of raisethefist.com in his house. The founder was currently asleep, woken up by a relative who said fbi, police and undercover's were currently up and down all of the streets, with they're eyes focused on the premises. Raisethefist.com founder aproached the door were 2 FBI agents demanded that he step outside. Within seconds a swarm of FBI raided the house with automatic weapons and shot guns. Additional police and fbi also stayed on the front lawn, around the house with a door baracade and additional weapons. "armed and ready". FBI and secret service entered the house, seizing all servers and political liturature. Raisethefist.com was currently being ran within the founders room of the house, over a computer network. The room was literarly ransacked, and all equipment, disks, cd's .. etc. were boxed up, loaded into a truck and seized until further notice. Since 1999, raisethefist.com has been under extensive government monitering. At times, Raisethefist.com has recieved over 100 hits from the U.S Department of Defense in a single day. The FBI, police department, NSA (and who else) continuesly monitered the site on a daily basis. Even government's from the UK, Canada, Lavtia, Belgium, Egypt, Finland, and Australia monitered the site continuesly. The FBI had also previously intercepted all packets going through the DSL line hosting the site, and have seized additional accounts being used by the site. In yet another successfull attempt to silence our vioces, Raisethefist.com, an anarchist/activist independent media/collective has been shut down by the secret service. "It's not yet known at this point if the site will be back up. As of now, we have nothing. No more servers, no more network, nothing. My room remains completly ransacked. My neighbors remain shaken up by what happend. I most likely won't be getting any of the equipment back. They also took alot of my political litature. Apparently, they're excuse for shutting it down was the 'militancy' portrayed on the site. This is not true. This was an excuse. This same 'militancy' they were concerned about is portrayed on at least a thousand other web sites across the internet, and they havn't been touched by the federal government, with the exception for remote monitering. Raisethefist.com was progresive. It was going somewhere. Kids started creating clubs in their schools called 'RaisetheFist'. People started utilizing the collective as a powerful resource for the activist/anarchist community. The federal government has been investigating me, and the site very closely, long before 9-11, and long before such militancy was even portrayed on the site. They knew the site had potential, that it was turning into something more than a site, but a strong collective utilized by activists throughout the world committed to social justice. And that's become a crime. Justice has become a crime. Freedom has become a crime. Anyone activly disagreeing with policies of the U.S is now automaticly rendered a "terrorist" in the eyes of national security.... Where raisethefist.com will go from here, I don't know. Based on what i've been told, i'll most likely be in jail, so most of my focus will be towards getting an attorney."

Mr nescio, I think you have gotten off to a bad start
by commenting and (apparently) not reading the paper at all. if you would care to point out which section you have a problem with,
it would help me.
I am well aware that nobody has any problem with fractional
reserve banking in classical economics and that conventional
wisdom is that it is intrinsic to the concept of banking.
mr nescio, you have no comment on the concept of a "reserve ratio" which I propose you address in your next
response, if any. parts of your response are basically
incorrect taking it into account. perhaps you could
explain what exactly the term "fractional reserve banking" means
and why it is called "fractional".
I basically agree with your response but you dont address
the issue of the amount of profit taken on the loan
by the bank vs. the amount taken by depositors. its true the paper did not look very closely into the issue
of private bank loans to individuals that you raise, I didnt
get to it, its obviously very important.

@_subject: Re: fractional reserve banking as economic parasitism 
hi mr syreeni
if you take a look at the paper, I cover the situations
you refer to, namely free market competition of banks
& why it is not very workable. its true I am taking the parasite analogy
quite far & few are likely to take it very seriously.
I dont really expect anyone to pay much attn to the paper
in the short run (humans are like that..).
re: your response,
the problem is that banking is not a free market activity
in the sense that depositors demand government bailouts
if their funds are lost due to too much of a gamble
on the reserves by banks. i.e. everyone pays. this can take
international scale proportions with e.g. world bank or
IMF. (re stiglitz accusations) not to rain on the libertarian parade, but imho this is one area that
free market competition does not seem to work. it just seems
to turn into competition for corruption, re: history of
"wildcat banks" in the US.
I disagree that "inadequate propagation of information about risks"
has much to do with the problem at all. the public puts
money in a bank not as a speculative activity but typically as
a deposit for safekeeping.
another problem, as I show in the paper, a bank that debases
its own currency into a larger system is actually leveraging
against all money holders in the economy, even those who do not involve
themselves with that bank. "gresham's law" which I give some
mathematical formulas for.
as for fractional reserve banking, I dont think bankers
actually understand the "econophysics" of it. mathematical
analysis has never really been done from the angle I pursue.

hi to old cohorts. the following is an announcement
for a treatise on money that has been many,many years in the making
which I finally put together. I think I finally found the
ultimate tentacle, so to speak.... :p
Ive been significantly influenced by the cypherpunk movement
& you can see the brushstrokes of it.
hot off the keyboard!!
I recently worked about 6 weeks on a complicated & comprehensive paper entitled
Fractional Reserve Banking as Economic Parasitism:
A Scientific, Mathematical and Historical Expose, Critique, and Manifesto
download it in PDF from the economics papers archive:
would be interested in any feedback. due to the contents,
am also attempting to maximize its exposure, please
help me spread the word.
would be happy to chat with anyone who has sensible
abstract This paper looks at the history of money and its modern form from a scientific and mathematical point of view.  The approach here is to emphasize simplicity.  A straightforward model and algebraic formula for a large economy analogous to the ideal gas law of thermodynamics is proposed.  It may be something like a new ``F=ma'' rule of the emerging econophysics field.  Some implications of the equation are outlined, derived, and proved. The phenomena of counterfeiting, inflation and deflation are analyzed for interrelations.  Analogies of the economy to an ecosystem or energy system are advanced.  The fundamental legitimacy of ``expansion of the money supply'' in particular is re-examined and challenged.  From the hypotheses a major (admittedly radical) conclusion is that the modern international ``fractional reserve banking system'' is actually equivalent to ``legalized economic parasitism by private bankers.'' This is the case because, contrary to conventional wisdom, the proceeds of inflation are not actually spendable by the state.  Also possible are forms of ``economic warfare'' based on the principles. Alternative systems are proposed to remediate this catastrophic flaw.
additional information:
- I draw key analogies to     (a) capitalism as a religion,
    (b) invisible slavery,     (c) parasitism, and
    (d) economic warfare
    (e) a short electronics analogy
  the parasitism metaphor is examined
  in most detail due to its apparent high fidelity.
- analogies of money issuance to company stock.
- there's a scathing critique of keynes & keynesianism
  as a ideology of economic parasitism. - a large section on greenspan and the gold standard.
- I tackle the issue of growth in the economy, and   relationship to interest rates.
- I define "scarcity integrity" of a banking system with
  features of "fairness" and "soundness". - there is significant commentary on the federal reserve   and by implication, international central banking systems. - I look significantly at US banking history and historical   personages such as jefferson.
- I challenge the conventional terminology of   "deflation, price stability, fighting inflation, growth,
  market rates".
- I examine luddism & how technology can actually      exacerbate slavery. "state-of-the-art 21st century sweatshops"
- re: parasitism, I look at very current research into   parasites that can cause sinister behavioral changes
  in the host & draw the analogies.
- free press as an immune system is examined.
- mcmurtry's "cancer stage of capitalism"-- rampant, parasitical   growth
- "silent weapons for quiet wars" paper considered seriously.
- "host psychological complicity"--  negative/pathological
  psychological qualities of the masses that allow parasitism   to flourish
- virulence, how deadly is the parasite? also, what is the
  meaning of growth relative to a parasite infection?
- national or international economic warfare via failed or corrupt   banks
- examination of pattern of economic warfare in IMF and   World Bank policies, accusations of joseph stiglitz
- mcfadden's, traficant's charges against the federal reserve bank
- possible alternative systems & key themes to focus on
  for money reformists
- proposal of many new research directions to pursue
section summaries

  complexity, computational revolution implication on economics,
  economics as biology, economics as energy system
brief history of money - fiat, receipt, fractional money   defined. counterfeiting, publicly-owned, privately-owned
  money expansion. straight vs expansion borrowing. money   manipulation vs supply & demand.
mathematical analysis - thermodynamics perfect gas law
  as bridge theorem, stock market, counterfeiting vs
  seigniorage, money energy extraction via money manipulation,
  velocity of money, temperature changes, growth, interest,

  optimal money expansion policy, higher verisimilitude models,
  electronics analogy, "blip corruption", scarcity integrity,
  fairness, soundness defined, money vs credit, blips used against
  nations
religion of capitalism - capitalism as taking irrational
  aspects of religion. orwellian doublespeak & false terminology
  and blind dogma. "voodoo economics". terms challenged:
  "money supply, deflation, fighting inflation, free market,
  lassiz fair, growth, market rates"
economic slavery - use of economic system for highly sophisticated,
  invisible slavery system. "21st century sweatshops". luddite
  movement re-examined. technology as a means for making
  slavery more efficient.
economic parasitism - parasite analogy developed in detail
  from latest research into parasitism. central importance
  of the bloodstream. leeches, bloodletting,
  destruction or deception of the host's immune system.
  "baitswitching and frogboiling". cancer metaphor.   "zombiefication". IMF/world bank policies as corrupted   by parasitism. keynesianism as bogus. red-queen dilemmas
  that accelerate rat-race conditions, host stress &   activity due to parasite influence. virulence considered,
  could parasite be beneficial? importance of parasitism
  in real ecosystem, possibly as regulatory mechanism.
  "host psychological complicity", negative psychological
  qualities of populace conducive to parasitism.
economic warfare - silent weapons for quiet wars,   use of bank failures and bailouts for parasite   advancement & immune system sacrifices. phenomenon
  of money leverage at local or global level. invisible
  seizure & invasion of economic territory via the   banking and money system. stiglitz accusation of   money parasitism within IMF and World Bank. use of

further research - better models, like global warming,
  improved econophysics research, fit the parameters,
  study it in terms of science/math/energy, fairness
  and soundness, localized testbest & experimental   laboratories, CPI and other indicator skews or bias.
frequently asked questions - a frivolous, facetious, satirical
  section but that serves as a brief introduction to the material   and some key themes. comedic relief. growth, inflation,
  gold, is there really a conspiracy? "witchhunts, mccarthyism".
  admitted weaknesses of the paper.
comments on references - info to other researchers looking
  to follow up on the material, a little road map. key
  references & brief comments. strengths and weaknesses of
  the references used for this paper. survey of especially
  the more definitive and comprehensive references.
stuff to add
one could spend a whole lifetime on this subject,
and many have. but my goal is only partly research,
another key goal is publicity & activism. you can
return the favor by helping publicize/spread the paper.
I didnt go into the biddle-jackson historical confrontation
much, but its a good or possibly best archetype for seeing how economics & political
power are interrelated. biddle led a team of bankers who
created a depression via money manipulation as a way of
controlling the masses and hopefully manipulating a political
election. it was a clearcut case of a econo-politico
conspiracy insinuated by the paper, where the "money parasite" apparently failed by a narrow miss, but arguably it was just a learning opportunity for later
also I have a section on the mathematics of gresham's law.
there is a slight bit of mathematics to add to show that
individuals gain or lose wealth in the parasitical bank
system based on their current wealth. in other words, there
is a specific threshhold parameter, a critical point, in
which those with wealth above it have "up leverage", i.e.
their wealth increases without action, and those below it
have "down leverage" (so to speak), i.e. their wealth decreases without
action. a gifted reader can easily derive these results.
that is, the modern banking system has a fundamentally
regressive "taxation" system built masquerading in the interest rate structure. "taxation" is a misleading term
because this is just a wealth transfer from the poor
to the rich, without any government services involved!
the paper does not play up the poor vs rich polarity
very much, but its obviously highly implicit in the entire work.
I didnt get into this, but one decoy for a parasite is
to portray "bumbling bureacrats". for example the IMF
& world bank might just take the cover of looking very
foolish & not able to understand the implications of its
policies. e.g. stiglitz seems to fall into this trap. as the
saying goes, "never attribute to malice what can adequately
be described by stupidity". but conversely, "if stupidity is not
adequate to explain it, then the malice must be confronted
and challenged if it is to be stopped!!"

@_subject: Re: signal to noise proposal 
ahem, yes I am aware any simple system is easily
circumvented & defeated, but that doesnt imply
that it will be.
Ive noticed many objections to any new proposal often
take the form, "but that would be different
than what we have now!!!" wow, amazing, no kidding!!!
I can come up with all kinds of objections to my own proposal, basically identical to what
everyone else wrote.
ok, fine, status quo stays the same :p lets just gripe,bitch,moan to the list
for another few years.  wheeeeeeeeeee
I thought things might be different after
a half decade of cyberspace lightning, but
so nice that some things just dont change.
yes, its cypherpunk stalemate as usual. I fully agree with TCM. who writes about it every
few weeks for the last ten years. hahahaha
cypherpunk == grandiose ideas, no execution.
99% inspiration, 1% perspiration hahahaha
q. whats the difference between a group of
cpunks & a group of arbitrary people chosen at random???
a. the arbitrary people OCCASIONALLY AGREE WITH EACH OTHER!! they also OCCASIONALLY WORK TOGETHER!!!
just for my own amusement I may write a quick
perl script to do some of the basic statistics
I suggested over a few weeks & post them. if anyone
knows of .tar.gz cpunk archives somewhere, I could
do it that much faster.
some may object & think this will only add to the noise,
but hey, as I always say, if you cant beat em, join
em :p

@_author: "plonk" 
@_subject: Re: signal to noise proposal 
hi guys, thanks for the feedback.
I have in mind a system that would work from
a few factors, with minimal intervention.
I specifically think that a
system of appointed moderators is **not** an ideal solution for a bazillion reasons.
that is precisely what I have "not" in mind.
the whole moderator thing is a step backward,
imho. cyberspace needs some kind of self-sustaining
all-user-supported system.
yes, I did forget to mention slashdot, they
do have a decent/workable reputation system.
I agree, I dont want the system to run over
the web as a required feature (but as a
supported one, OK).
the basic ideas I am toying with are the following:
- posts to the list are like currency. lurkers
are not really useful to mailing lists as
far as advancing the dialogue. so the mailing list
simply records # of posts written by each poster. call
this "P"
- mailing list records # of times someone wrote
a post that was replied to. posts that get replies
are generally an indicator of interest, useful
posts, etc.. call this "R"
- pseudoreputation is a measure of the above two
parameters. one can experiment with different
metrics/weightings as a combination. e.g. x*P + y*R etc
- mailing list allows anyone to flip a bozo bit on
another poster ("plonk") or "unplonk".
but the plonk is weighted
based on the plonker's "reputation" by above. this
is so anonymous plonks dont have any value, but someone
who has built up some reputation can have an effect
on plonking other users. users can negotiate with
each other behind the scenes or on the list to ask
for "unplonking". the plonk note to a server can include
a "reason for plonking msg" & gets sent to the plonked user.
- mailing list outputs current reputation alongside
peoples posts. I.e. if my reputation value is currently
[x], there's a "reputation-value: x" field output
in outgoing msgs. this is available for filtering
by end users.
- mailing list might also support a filter
such that people can toss out msgs from sources with
too low a reputation by their specification.
- I propose that those with low reputations are not
bounced from the list, only given quotas. say the
lower the reputation goes, the fewer msgs per day
they are allowed to post.
- everyone is subject to the same rules. there are
no moderators or appointed keepers of the sacred
signal-to-noise. however those with greater reputation
have greater effect. as you can see reputation is
based on (a) posts, (b) replies, and (c) avoidance
of plonks. but note the system is workable even
without plonking.
the tweaking would have a lot to do with the weighting of the reputation, etcetera.
none of this requires moderation or a lot of extra
activity, which I think is absolutely crucial in
any workable system. nobody wants it to be any work
at all.

@_author: now over a decade 
@_subject: signal to noise proposal 
hi all. Ive been fascinated with the problem of signal to noise for as long as Ive been dinking
around in internet-cyberspace (now over a decade).
oldtimers may recall that Ive had many various proposals
over the past on the list.
it does seem that cypherpunks has succumbed to
significant entropy lately, surely partly related
to the "official" anarchist policies...
in the spirit of the great cpunk accomplishments such
as remailers, encryption code etc, I would like to
talk to any gifted programmers that would like to
work on a very innovative prototype mailing list system that might
solve the signal-to-noise problem. this would be an outstanding grad student project if you ask me. experiments in collaborative filtering.
the basic idea is related to something I call
a "self regulating network". its never really been
shown but the internet comes close. basically everyone
on the network has some say (vote) as to how it is governed.
this has some related ideas.
I have some ideas that wouldnt be too complicated to
code, basically tweaks to a majordomo system to allow some extra out-of-bandwidth info that gets
passed around, something like a reputation system.
yes, I could code it myself, but I have other
projects, I want to contribute design time.
Id like to run it "extreme programming style", getting
something up as fast as possible & making tweaks
& modifications while it runs.
if it "clicks" I think it could have major implications.
for example there are now tens of thousands of yahoo
groups, its a multimillion dollar company. now imagine
approaching yahoo & selling them proven, tested technology
for egalitarian managing of mailing lists to maximize
signal to noise that doesnt require a moderator to babysit
the mailing list.
on the other hand maybe there are no longer any
serious coders on this list.... a pity/shame if
that were the case. (this is not to imply that
coders would immediately agree to work on this haha)
anyway just out of curiousity I'll post this.
plz email me if you're interested.
