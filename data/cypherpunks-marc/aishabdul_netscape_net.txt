@_subject: lets do this for the world. 
How are you,
   my name is Mrs. Aisha Abdul, widow to late Mr. Ali Abdul,
   fomer owner of AB PETROLEUM,kuwait.
   I am from KUWAIT and i am 68years old,
   suffering from long time cancer of the breast.
   From all indications my condition is really
   deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't
   live more than 2 months according to my doctors.
   This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a
   very bad stage. i dont want your pity but i need your trust.
   My late husband died early last year from
   heart attack, and during the period of our marriage
   we couldn't produce any child. My late husband was
   very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his
   business and wealth.The doctor has advised me that I
   will not live for more than 2 months, so I have now
   decided to spread all my wealth, to contribute mainly
   to the development of charity in Africa, America, Asia
   and Europe.am sorry if you are embarrased by my
   mail.i found your e-mail address in the web
   directory,and i have decided to contact you,but if
   for any reason you find this mail offensive,you can
   ignore it and please accept my appology.
  before my late husband died he was a major oil tycoon,
  in kuwait and deposited the sum of 4 million dollars
  (four million dollars) in a security company in europe some
  years ago,thats all i have left now,i need you to collect this funds   and distribute it yourself to charity  .                                                                        so that when i die my soul can rest in peace.
  the funds will be entirely in hands and management.
  i hope God gives you the wisdom to touch
  very many lives,that is my main concern.
  20% of this money will be for your time and effort,
  while 80% goes to charity.Please reply immediately.
  God bless you.
  Mrs. AISHA ABDUL.
