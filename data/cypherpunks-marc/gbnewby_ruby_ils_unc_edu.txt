I heard back from several people interested in this.
Someone on the ground in NYC please pick a time
& place (or we can meet at the conference site and
adjourn someplace suitable).
The full H2K2 schedule is available, In addition to JYA and I, CP speaker presence will include
Peter Wayner and Declan.
 ** Someone else please pick a time and gathering
 ** location.
A good gathering location will be the info desk/vendor
area on the 2nd floor.  There will be some sort of
bulletin board, so a paper message mentioning the
"CP Meet" could go up there.
My suggestion would be Saturday night late, after
Robert Steele's presentation (starts 10:00 pm, will
probably go until midnight).  If that's too late
for CP kids, I'm not sure what to suggest since
sessions run 10a-12a daily.
See you then!

Sounds like a plan....someone try to remember to put a sign
up on-site for this.  An actual address for the bar would be nice - is this the one on 33rd?
