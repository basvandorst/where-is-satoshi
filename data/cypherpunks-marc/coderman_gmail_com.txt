DWDM certainly makes it more complicated.  Of course, that same
technology allows them to send much more back. (Regarding the single
OC-3 mentioned previously.)
How they process and return the information is indeed the BIG SECRET. The old USSR taps used pods attached to the cables for recording and
were serviced periodically to pick up the collected data.
See also: If you look at the landing sites for various oceanic fiber cables you
will see that a great many of them are on "friendly" territory.  You
can be sure that these lines are tapped.  (Which brings up the issue
someone else mentioned a while ago.  We make a big deal about ECHELON
monitoring satellites, yet no one really cares about the tapping of
landing sites that carry many times more information?  Silly humans)
I presume the fiber tapping submarine is interested mainly in those
cables which don't land on friendly territory or the sections landed
between unfriendly sites. (E.g. not all data goes through all sites)
This would be a reasonable assumption.  But so would a number of other
possible techniques.  The great mystery continues...

@_subject: Fwd: Sampled Traffic Analysis by Internet-Exchange-Level 
Some of you might remember my email to this list in February, where I
asked for help from operators of Tor nodes in the UK [1]. This was for
an experiment to establish how diverse the topology of the Tor network
is -- an important component of how secure it is against traffic
analysis. Thanks to all those who responded to my request; I had a
great response and very interesting results.
I've now finished the draft version of the resulting paper, which is
to be presented at the PET Workshop (Ottawa, Canada, June 20--22 2007)
[2]. The latest version of the paper can be found at this URL:
 There is also an introduction to the area, and a summary of the paper
on my research group's blog "Light Blue Touchpaper":
 My paper, co-authored with Piotr Zielinksi, is a follow-up to Nick
Feamster and Roger Dingledine's paper, "Location Diversity in
Anonymity Networks" [3]. In it, they point out that bouncing anonymity
network traffic around lots of countries might not be as good as it
seems because there are a small number of ISPs which show up on many
of the links to, from and between Tor nodes.
What our paper explores is that even if you deal with this problem,
and choose paths with a diverse collection of ISPs, there are still
Internet exchanges on many of the paths. These do not appear in the
BGP data that Feamster and Dingledine use, which is why I had to
resort to a more limited-scale traceroute-based study.
So not only are Internet Exchanges good places to put traffic analysis
equipment, but some (including LINX [4] and AMS-IX [5]) collect the
necessary data anyway, for performance measurement purposes. They only
record the headers of one in every few thousand packets, but our paper
also shows that, even with such low-quality data, traffic analysis
still works.
There's certainly no reason to panic about these results, as there is
still much more work to be done in this area. For example, the picture
in the US, where Internet exchanges are less popular, will likely be
different. I do hope that the paper will encourage future work on both
establishing more accurate estimates of attack costs and developing

hi Steven; an enjoyable read.  thank you!
i am curious about a few aspects.
you state "an assumption that the global passive adversary is
unrealistic".  is this really true in anonymity research circles?  it
seems the evidence to the contrary is well supported.  i do prefer the
"those who are the target of such adversaries have larger problems
than anonymous Internet access" statement instead.  :)
i am also curious if you had considered lower layer propinquity of
physical paths.  critical infrastructure research has shown how even
seemingly disparate and redundant paths are often inhabiting common
right of way and facilities.  is the assumption that inspection at
OC/WDM layers is too cumbersome/expensive for all but the previously
mentioned TLA/$gov adversaries?
given the surprises looking at network topology from an IX rather than
AS level, i'd expect a similar revelation when viewing from an optical
carrier vantage point.
sadly, the information useful for such study has become a subject of
heated and irrational censorship post 9/11.  i'll stop this tangent

right.  tap all the interesting fibers, feed to narus.
the narus is there specifically so they don't have to backhaul a
mirror of the traffic.  it does all the inspection to isolate
interesting information, then sends back that interesting information
to aggregation points, before that in turn is sent on to NSA.
the bridgeton center att noc is a good example.  there is a room
controlled by multi-factor biometric authentication (print, retinal)
with man trap doors.  this is probably the room used for distributing
configuration to the remote monitoring points (it's unlikely they
store much of interest at the remote sites, since the security is much
lower at these places) as well as aggregation of the feeds for
backhaul to NSA.
see also the new NSA facilities being built in denver, CO.  this is an
ideal place to aggregate traffic across the country...
from the sounds of it, the taps did introduce some problems which were
resolved quickly.  probably not from signal loss, but who knows.
in any case, i don't think powering an optical amplifier is difficult

@_subject: AES broken? 
We describe a new simple but more power-
ful form of linear cryptanalysis. It appears to break AES
(and undoubtably other cryptosystems too, e.g. SKIP-
JACK). The break is "nonconstructive," i.e. we make it
plausible (e.g. prove it in certain approximate probabilis-
tic models) that a small algorithm for quickly determining
AES-256 keys from plaintext-ciphertext pairs exists b but
without constructing the algorithm. The attack's runtime
is comparable to performing 64w encryptions where w is
the (unknown) minimum Hamming weight in certain bi-
nary linear error-correcting codes (BLECCs) associated
with AES-256. If w < 43 then our attack is faster than ex-
haustive key search; probably w < 10. (Also there should
be ciphertext-only attacks if the plaintext is natural En-
AES's current status. In view of both (a) Bernstein's tim-
ing attack, (b) our nonconstructive argument for a cracking
algorithm, (c) the possibility of a "'trapdoor," we believe that
   1. AES should be abandoned
   2. cryptosystems provably immune to these attacks should
      be investigated, and
   3. our argument for crack-existence, since it is nonrigor-
      ous5 , should be investigated more carefully.
3.6    Now get paranoid
Suppose AES-256's designers had evilly arranged matters so
that some "code of the code" (known to them) unexpectedly,
contained a remarkably low-weight word (known to them),
with say, w 10. That would constitute a trapdoor enabling
cracking it with much smaller eo,ort 64w . If w = 10, they
could crack AES with 6410 = 260 pc-pairs. If w = 7 then
AES-256 would be as easy to crack as the cited attacks on
DES (only 242 pc-pairs needed)!
This could be the case even if the random codes approxima-
tion underlying our crude analysis in B'3.3 was invalid.
4 What now?
Obviously, B'2's strengthened form of linear cryptanalysis will
attack a wide variety of secret key cryptosystems, not just
AES-256, and will quite often raise the worry that there might
exist some intentionally or unintentionally inserted "trap-
door." I currently see no feasible way for AES's designers
to disprove the existence of this kind of trapdoor. And Bern-
stein's cache-timing attack [4] seems applicable against es-
sentially any system that employs Sboxes. That's a lot of
In short, almost every secret key cryptosystem yet proposed is
now busted or at least suspect. We need to design new kinds
of cryptosystems immune to both kinds of attack.

the exit wall of sheep (embassy passwds) was lame but the control port
opener was nifty.
sequence for the control port payload injection:
- two vectors for form payload, a third for ip leakage across three
proxies on broadband
- javascript posts form automatically to localhost:9051 using:
 action=" method="post"
enctype="multipart/form-data" target="stylearea"  [that last to keep
the response from the tor control part spewing over the current page -
this puts it in a hidden iframe]
- all existing <FORM's in exit requests modified via proxies to inject
the TEXTAREA with payload into a hidden form element while leaving the
appearance of a legitimate form page (so any submit pwns, too late.
even lynx on openbsd if your control port is on 127.0.0.1:9051 (or any
accessible port if you've got a motivated attacker...))
- IP leakage for all IE on win32 users that aren't using a transparent
proxy (janusvm) via SMB/NetBIOS and WebDAV to external host with
tracking nonce directory name.  even if the control port is not open,
this will leak the origin of the request as webdav is below the
browser, interpreted in the file system / win32 api context. (SMB is
not nearly as useful as webdav since most ISPs filter NetBIOS and
SMB/CIFS traffic even if you explicitly allow at the router.)
- the purpose of the payload was an interesting 150-200k+ command set
for the control port to apply.  among various things this performed
the following:
- redirect the notice log to /dev/null on *nix like systems or to a
webdav path on one of the proxies. (this leaks ip immediately on win32
in addition to routing ongoing notices messages to the proxy directly.
- invalidate all known authentic nodes on the existing Tor network via
ExcludeNodes with digests, configure three new rogue nodes as
authoritative directories and exits, and finally starting a hidden
service and posting the .onion name to the proxy server.
- map local ports to the hidden service onion allowing an anonymous
user on the rogue Tor network to arbitrarily connect to the client
onion and interface with their Tor control port in real time.
- vulnerable Tor clients (not using transparent proxy like janusvm)
start falling by the thousands into the rogue Tor network for the
duration of a few hours while the attack was being tested...

electronics are naturally fast (700+ GHz)
- Extremely low power: In principle reversible (zero heat generation);
in practice power consumption & heat generation drastically reduced
(factors of millions)
- At the limits of physics: Universal quantum computer can't do better
slides 14-21 are nice visualizations of the adiabatic QC implementation and use.
adiabatic quantum computation model:
- Computer initialized in "easy to reach" (convex) ground state
- Answer encoded in final state
- All currents adjusted slowly enough so that system remains in ground
state at all times
- AQC can be universal for QC  [ed: this is the crux, algorithms to
express some problems in AQC model difficult (right now)]
- AQC is exact by definition

- Computer initialized in ground state
- Answer encoded in final state
- All currents adjusted over period of time fixed by user [ed: key

- QA is a heuristic algorithm [ed: key difference wrt AQC]
D-Wave processors can implement either AQC or QA models of computation.

the next revision, the C5P, and all C5/C7 cores since than have
included two of these sources, individually selectable or capable of
working in tandem. (6 oscillators)
the throughput of these devices varies from 200k-2Mbps in a most
paranoid configuration, with whitener enabled and a conservative
sampling, up to more than 100Mbps in dual full throttle configuration
(which should only be used when the on die AES or SHA1 is applied to
obscure TRNG bias).
Toshiba Corp. has claimed a major breakthrough in the field of
security technology: It has devised the world's highest-performance
physical random-number generator (RNG) circuit.
The device generates random numbers at a data rate of 2.0 megabits a
second, according to Toshiba in a paper presented at the International
Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) here.
i must assume they are splitting hairs here, as VIA is not the only
one to outperform such benchmarks, but you do buy the whole chip, not
a stand-alone TRNG IC component.
in any case, it is amusing that they got such mileage from a
masturbatory press release, while things like padlock, integrating
crypto directly into CPU instructions, seems to garner less respect

if one fails you have a backup and combined they can double

it is useful to whiten and/or mask any potential bias of the entropy
source with a run through a cipher or digest.  it's important to note
that you should be verifying entropy before this step (FIPS sanity
checks) otherwise your RNG could be highly biased and you'd not notice
from the whitened, masked output.
there are two schools of hardware entropy harvesting thought:
- use a von Neumann whitener to distill the raw entropy into a high
quality, low (single bit) bias source. this will also cut throughput
by an order of magnitude, perhaps.
- use a block cipher or digest to mask any bias that may be present in
an un-whitened, wide open source.

this is indeed not a huge leap over VIA padlock's dual on core sources

hit 100Mbps with whitening disabled and both sources enabled.  if
you're initializing FDE drives with good entropy this 1.7Gbps might be
useful.  otherwise i have a hard time consuming even a fraction of the

rewarding volunteers with t-shirts makes them feel good about their

them subconsciously start to value their contribution based on the
cash you give them. So they're more likely to stop volunteering, as
they don't feel their effort is properly appreciated. More details

masking possible low entropy. I'd prefer to see raw conditoned stream than
"encrypted" one (even web content looks high-entropy to Diehard when
i have loved the padlock engines on via cores since they hit the
market in C5XL form with a single hw generator available via XSTORE.
unlike many designs this free wheeling resource can provide a torrent
of entropy sufficient to sate even the most gregarious consumption.
as mentioned above, you need a fast user space entropy daemon sanity
checking the raw, (probably) biased stream coming from hardware but it
is still good practice to digest this entropy to obscure any potential
generator state/bias heading into the host entropy pool.
that is to say, of the two common modes for utilizing hw entropy:
a. conservatively sample from a whitened, string filtered entropy
source for a low rate of high quality output (see xstore config words)
b. ramp un-whitened, un-filtered source(s) to maximum rate and AES/SHA
mix for high throughput, high quality output while irreversibly
masking generator bias/state present in the raw source stream.
the latter is more effective in practice and capable of generation
rates > 20Mbps with full FIPS sanity checks. the former tops out
around 1Mbps or less with more transient latency spikes on read (when
successive attempts to read fail to pass whiten+strfilter). note that
padlock engine supports SHA and AES on die as well making these easy
and fast to apply to generator output.
if you are still concerned a more conservative configuration would
estimate entropy density while feeding from raw input stream and add
encrypted/digested product to the host entropy pool with the specified
entropy density estimate adjusted downward to your requirements. (most
OS'es support this)

Since Intel
uh, what? you realize you're comparing a very noisy but very very
small entity against the remaining core of a modern many hundred
million gate processor right?
you can certainly disable / idle the sources when not needed, but
really, left wide open all the time they're a drop in the bucket.
it is the throughput and efficiency that makes it most useful. like
the AES XCRYPT instruction in VIA Padlock cores. you may avoid a
number of cache timing and other timing based side channel attacks on
software cipher implementations using hw as well, since they often
execute one or more rounds in a handful of cycles. there are probably
other advantages.
the crypto cluefull know the value of mixing a high throughput, easily
managed entropy source with host and application true random number
facilities (/dev/random, /dev/urandom, OpenSSL random engine support,
XSTORE instruction in userspace, etc.)
the key to using a hw source properly:
1. initialize, measure, and mix the raw source(s) with a userspace
entropy daemon.
2. continuously sanity check the read data over a large byte span and
remove a hardware entropy source that is not functioning within
comfortable tolerance. FIPS does have a nice suite of checks - again,
this can't prove your source is robust, only that it doesn't suck
horribly and obviously. :)
3. run the hw random data through a block cipher or hash digest to
mask generator bias before adding to host entropy facilities with a
conservative entropy density estimate. while the VIA and other good HW
sources can produce very high density output i prefer at most an 80%
estimation on input for robust distribution into the host pool as
4. periodically save state for use with mixing initialization in step
 on next restart.
5. monitor without writing if anomalies in the hw sources arise during
operation. with VIA XSTORE on C5P or greater (not C5XL with single
source) you have two independent sources which can be enabled or
disabled as needed. on such systems you can fall back to half-rate
throughput on the good source if the other goes bad.
if you mean "raw" as in omitting all of the steps above and just
reading /dev/hwrandom then i agree. otherwise, see above. :)
i can get > 80Mbps of entropy on VIA hw entropy sources. have you ever
tried to use /dev/random on a headless server? a recently booted
workstation? for more than a few keys at a time? etc?
keep secure state, properly mixed, and even a highly biased input
would be whitened and obscured beyond utility. i'd like to see
reasoning otherwise for XSTORE sources and XCRYPT AES mixing before
conservatively mixed into properly seeded /dev/random kernel pool. if
it is too biased (OpenSSL weak keys :) then the FIPS sanity checks
will kick it out and you're denied entropy rather than compromised
it's really a shame crypto isn't standard on every DIE. although if
they do a poor job of it the annoyance outweighs the utility. the SHA
instruction on Padlock borders on unusable without hacks like
interrupting the REP mode instruction with a fault/intr. so you can
grab the un-finalized work-in-progress digest state for large

- extend upon this base to facilitate effective and accountable
municipal administration.
- extend upon this base to achieve robust state governance.
- finally, leverage this outgrowth of competent administration and

---------- Forwarded message ----------
while most were enjoying libations or talks a very interesting event
was taking place at the conference.
we're all familiar with the hostility of WiFi and GSM networks at DEF
CON, however, this year the most hostile network on earth was not
802.11; it was CDMA and 4G!
on Friday some parts of Anon and Lulz made appearance. by early
Saturday morning a weapon was deployed.
some characteristics:
- full active MitM against CDMA and 4G connections from Rio to carriers.
- MitM positioning for remote exploitation to ring0 on Android and PC.
- fall back to userspace only or non-persistent methods when
persistent rootkit unattainable.
- many attack trees and weaponized exploits. escalation from easy pwns
up to specialized techniques and tactics until success is achieved.
- simultaneous attack across CDMA and 4G connections using full power
in these LICENSED bands.
- operated continuously (except for outages :) from early Saturday
until 8am Monday.
- designed with intent: mass exploitation, reconnaissance,
exfiltration, eavesdropping.
how to tell if you met the beast at Rio:
- did you accept an upgrade for Android, Java, or other applications? (oops)
- did you notice 3G/4G signal anomalies, including full signal yet
poor bandwidth or no link?
- did you notice your Android at full charged plugged in, but dropping
to <50% charge once unplugged?
- did you notice 4G download speeds at quarter of usual, yet uploads
over twice as fast?
- did you notice Android services that immediately respawn when
killed? (Voice Search?)
- does your Android no longer connect to USB debugging yet adbd is alive?
- does your PC have an sshd that cannot be kill -9'd?
- did your Android crash - a hard freeze, and then take a long time to
...many other indicators, but for now that's sufficient to express the point.
if you met the beast, it seemed to have a nearly perfect success rate;
your odds not good.  in fact you probably didn't even notice as it
pilfered bytes off your devices and monitored your conversations.
i have waited over six DEF CONs to meet an adversary of this skill.
i was not disappointed.
did the talks suck this year because the good stuff is under NDA?
clearly a lot of you are selling out...
to those who got pwned, i would be interested in your experiences and

my last comment for this sad, confused tangent of a thread;
  it has been accosted via conjecture with too much frequency *grin*
SCTP for congestion control of transparent proxy TCP/UDP traffic.
local classification of traffic allocates by protocol / use fairness
instead of aggregate tcp fairness. like bittorrent or aria2 parallel
traffic treated as distinct low priority unit of traffic, deferring to
higher priority low latency web traffic and messaging.
multi-homing / multi-path endpoints in SCTP would maintain concurrent
connection with distinct endpoints, avoiding predecessor, timing,
denial of service attacks present in reliable, ordered, single stream
edges would be screwed as you mention, unless they were full fledged
participants consistently. using a UDP based transport with LEDBAT or
other technique to keep broadband upstream unsaturated and unclogged
(no deep queues), allowing all broadband endpoints the ability to
contribute to a large shared network.
ORCHID IPv6 addressing with IPsec tunnels is intended to re-use
existing work, including well tested auth+privacy with datagram
padding in IPsec. SCTP+TLS would fit over top of IPv6 ORCHID endpoints
(using IPsec SAs) to transport signalling/keying and encapsulated
client traffic. part of this would also include lowest priority (lossy
reliable) SRMP type delivery of useful, less immediate information to
nodes. to some extent the ORCHID addresses could be thought of as
hidden service names and also circuit endpoints for a given IPsec
this set of:
a. critical signalling and keying traffic
b. high priority, interactive web traffic and messaging
c. lower priority bulk traffic, downloads, streaming media
d. best effort, latent bulk caching and exchange
are the classful shaping groups ordered inside of opaque SFQ outbound
queues at various improved/concurrent stratified dependent link
padding paths of IPsec telescopes carrying intermediate
hop(signalling) and bearer traffic.
combining better prioritization of traffic and consistent consumption
of traffic (deferring low priority packets and using opportunistic
caching strategies for network information respectively) obtains the
best performance out of the SFQ DLP paths with the lowest latency for
priority traffic.
still, so many details left as exercise for the reader ;)
sort of, for only parts; if you want a portable user space
implementation (or port) it's all custom. the joys of wild conjecture
include absurd timelines and technical effort for free...
rump is about as close as i've seen: this is not the least of "how to deploy a thing like this" concerns.

in the order of precedence of security risks, much bigger holes must
be addressed before formal verification provides return on time
if you're building verified compilers, or micro kernels, or core
libraries, this doesn't apply to you. ;)
i want seL4 in a Qubes isolation model, formally verified CryptoBox,
this makes no sense to me; patently absurd on the face of it.
why test code with clusters that are larger than your build systems?
why do we exist? ...
utility of quality measures can not be judged on superficial metrics
like "size in GB" or "processor hours".  anyone using this argument as
a disqualifier is not qualified to make such an assessment.
this is a great approach and fits in well with other security through
isolation defense in depth.  combining the strengths of formal
verification at critical core points within a system, and then
leveraging that robust core to isolate, constrain, mediate between
higher level applications seem most reasonable, tractable, with the
best return on time invested.
if i had a wishlist it would be:
- 64bit CompCert (not just 64bit int support :)
- verified virtualization isolation model (seL4 Qubes like system?)
- verified crypto_sign_edwards25519sha512batch and
crypto_sign_nistp256sha512ecdsa implementations
- verified compression, regexp, and other common libraries that are
useful at the security boundary between isolated domains or
some of the work done for quark might be partially applicable to some

confirmation and analysis[0]; GPA is pretty tame perhaps!
in any case the challenge you mention: thwarting or preventing traffic
analysis without a full mix of constant traffic. if the datagram based
system above existed, combine with:
- stochastic fair queuing and re-ordering of egress traffic. by
"clamping" the outbound rate of randomized, re-ordered datagrams to a
broad "size/chunk" of capacity, you deter traffic confirmation,
anonymity set reduction, and other traffic analysis attacks of various
- client-side classification of application traffic into prioritized
classes[1] for ingress / dgm proxy level active shaping by classful
HTB queues before transiting the first hop and losing all visibility
into the content and priority of message payloads.
- integrate a lowest effort / unreliable background reliable multicast
like bulk transport channel for resource and key pre-caching, network
participant and performance information distribution, secure remote
archives, random performance measurement/tests across peer groups,
other low priority communications suited for this "filler" class of
traffic. (consuming more or less filler traffic helps smooth out the
effective throughput and efficiency when changing the broad
"stochastic traffic capacity range" appropriate for a given peer.)
- provide LEDBAT or AQM management of edge traffic to upstream(s) to
prevent unnecessary latency in upstream buffers. this ensures that
even at full utilization the responsiveness of the broadband link is
- and the multi-path SCTP, IPsec, UDP NAT traversal and encapsulation,
and other user space network stacks communicating across this overlay
network as discussed above for requisite application and control
communication support.
these techniques combined allow you to use still not insignificant
"stochastic traffic capacity ranges" instead of a constant fixed
amount of traffic to protect against these attacks.  these stochastic
ranges can be adjusted up or down as network performance and capacity
dictate. this protocol provides congestion control and TCP
friendliness while greatly reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed
relative to a traditional mix.
at best (in theory), an attacker with local active and global passive
methods on hand could discern anonymity sets for broad categories /
scales of possible communication usage.  E.g. anon set A exhibits
traffic utilization on the order of 1Mbps to 5Mbps, while anon set B
exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 5Mbps to 50Mbps, and anon
set C exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 50Mbps to 1Gbps,
given this drawback, code a kick ass client with participation enabled
by default if sufficient connectivity and resources are available.
you've now made these broad traffic volume sets nearly useless in a
practical / actionable sense.
congratulations! you've now got a traffic analysis resistant low
latency anonymity protocol, implementation, and network that nearly
anyone can participate in and contribute to. for my next magic hand
wave, a directory / route selection method that scales to billions of
peers while leveraging geographic propinquity and social peer groups
to constrain Sybil attacks and impact of bad actors.
next grow network capacity in a way that continually applies implicit
feedback from the network overall and peers directly and your
deterrence to these attacks begins to improve further over time,
perhaps even one day hitting a tipping point of prevalence and
persistence for de-facto victory in most threat models...
we can dream!
perhaps someone should toss up a Bitcoin donation address to support
work on detailed technical specifications, experimental prototypes,
maintaining clouds for continuous builds, regression checks, load
tests, and traffic analysis for quality measurement and security
could also use donations for bounties for identifying or exploiting
security or privacy vulnerabilities in the design and implementation
of this final generation anonymous network.  whoever sets this up
should probably use an onion to coordinate development and distribute
sources, other resources...

0. "From a Trickle to a Flood: Active Attacks on Several Mix Types"
  1. i have mentioned the following classes before, with each in
priority order for the HTB prioritization / shaping before traffic
enters the network and becomes opaque:
 a. control and signalling traffic - always takes precedence.
 b. real-time and interactive communications, but not video.
 c. real-time video communication, if applicable.
 d. low priority bulk communication.  torrents, archives, opportunistic caching
 e. filler / last-tier best effort unreliable traffic as mentioned
above for filling in the remaining capacity at the current stochastic
rx/tx rate center point.
2.  instead of trying to research and author formal proofs of entropy
bounds for various idealized models, cut straight to the chase and
build the most aggressive, best in class developmental learning / deep
learning systems for classification and identification of nodes,
flows, protocols, identities in a test bed setup that provides full
traffic visibility and active client edge MitM capability (E.g.
simulate attack via rogue AP or cell tower for tagging? selective DoS?
others,).  malicious attacks performed by the remote end or injected
by remote's upstream are not in scope for this traffic analysis and
privacy assessment. however, passive capture of all exit
communications and ORCHID hidden endpoint communications is in scope
for analysis.

the best kind of problems!
correct. i mention them as a prerequisite for both protection and usability.
protection for example, with end-to-end SCTP multi-homed endpoints via
userspace stacks would avoid predecessor attacks - if you block one
route there are others which transit traffic, maintaining an
uninterrupted session across otherwise individually volatile paths.
usability for example to support UDP traffic and applications which
are not currently served via TCP and connection oriented services.
sadly, even TCP re-invented in user space is insufficient. you want a
specific protocol implementation of multi-homed SCTP in userspace,
probably on top of other protocol supports like LEDBAT or AQM. perhaps
using ORCHID IPv6 identifiers for endpoint addressing. lot's of
options; and as you said: it's a hard problem!
this is a separate problem. for the core transport encapsulation in
UDP may be sufficient. for censorship avoidance you will likely need
to bounce over a DUST like path first to access such an anonymizing
network. topology is an interesting subject, as the design must be
decentralized but may not need to be homogenous.
you want variable latency at the datagram level (e.g. stochastic
reordering and shaping of traffic, with prioritization done at the
endpoint where flows are visible.) more than the utmost in
performance. as long as it is overall TCP fair of course :)
and this is just the start. we haven't touched on network discovery,
path awareness/selection/weighting, etc.  as you said, hard problems;
the best kind of problems!

it is straightforward to do this, if you enforce hw entropy sources as
a requirement:
1. modify initramfs / init to load and initialize any hwrandom
modules. halt boot if hw source is not present or usable.
2. have early init perform sanity check (1-5s) of hw entropy before
continuing boot. halt is hw source is not viable.
3. modify rng daemon to exit with special value and trigger halt on
trng read failure or out of bounds statistical behavior (e.g.
continually failing trivial FIPS checks).
thus you know that hardware and other entropy sources are active and
running at boot.
thus you know that key generation is always utilizing good entropy
pool state or else host would halt. (excluding active intervention,
which may be in your threat model!)
i first implemented this in a custom kernel+initramfs for the C5/C7
VIA systems with loop-aes FDE of a slackware based system. for any of
the recent ubuntu, knoppix, tails, qubes, fedora and slack distros you
can modify the post-FDE protected init scripts to do this, with a
simple modification to the rngtools daemon and init script. (i still
use mtrngd myself ;)

i am surprised this has not surfaced more often in this thread:
 if you need good entropy: use a hardware entropy generator!
also use a userspace entropy collector like dakarand or haveged, use a
userspace entropy daemon for seeding system entropy pool (/dev/random)
from hardware sources (like /dev/hw[_-]?random, unless you trust
RDRAND ;)
this is true no matter what operating system you use, where on a clean
boot in a headless system you must choose between denial of service or
silent insecurity.
not to mention being under served in unexpected high usage situations,
like initializing full disk crypto volumes with /dev/random or
extremely high volume web server endpoints with high entropy
utilization requirements.
if you are running virtual machines this implies virtio random devices
or VM safe instructions (if you trust RDRAND ;) to provide strong
entropy within the guest systems as well. not to mention proper
administration to ensure you're saving seeds and not sharing pool
state between instances, etc.
over ten years ago i wrote a threaded entropy daemon for the C5XL
XSTORE instruction that provided megabits of entropy from /dev/random
after configuring the MSR for XSTORE, sanity checks in the mtrngd, and
writing to /dev/random when poll indicated users had consumed entropy
from the system, thus ensuring /dev/random never went dry.
ten years later and still the state of the consumer, embedded, and
enterprise markets is totally inadequate, with the one recent ray of
hope (RDRAND) intentionally obfuscated in a way that threatens trust.
in short, if you are not doing one or more of the following:
- hardware rng with userspace daemon for hw rng
- userspace entropy collector (haveged, dakarand, others)
- securely seeded and re-seeded CSRNG (for VMs with boot and runtime
entropy passing)
you are doing it wrong. it is just a matter of risk/cost to exploit
your use of "randomness"!
 (and the above does not mitigate your risk, it merely makes other

in the order of precedence of security risks, much bigger holes must
be addressed before formal verification provides return on time

this is a great approach and fits in well with other security through
isolation defense in depth.  combining the strengths of formal
verification at critical core points within a system, and then
leveraging that robust core to isolate, constrain, mediate between
higher level applications seem most reasonable, tractable, with the
best return on time invested.

- verified virtualization isolation model (seL4 Qubes like system?)
- verified crypto_sign_edwards25519sha512batch and

- verified compression, regexp, and other common libraries that are

one last cautionary tale:
some time back i used the techniques discussed to harden some Android
phones brought with me into a hostile environment. i had kernel level
protections in place, hardened the system configuration and services,
pared down apps to the minimum and constrained their access to the
file system and network. this was months of effort.
the first adversarial encounter went very well in my favor - all of
the attempts to exploit my devices were thwarted at these various
layers and via these protections, with the sole exception of a Google
Voice Search hack that kept voice search active in an "open mic night"
eavesdropping capability.  this was quickly nullified via kill -STOP
(Android won't re-spawn an app that is already running, and a stopped
process proved quite effective at halting this repeated invocation of
search used to capture audio.)
fast forward to round two, and i doubled down on the kernel, system,
and application level protections. even more scrutiny is applied to
applications to avoid the misuse of legitimate functionality for
malicious purpose.  i am feeling confident!
... and then a baseband exploit easily walks under all of my
protections at every layer, completely and fully 0wning my devices,
with the only hint at anything amiss being the elevated thermal
dissipation and power consumption from the radios performing data
transmission, all while the Android OS believed the devices were
silent in airplane mode.
[informative interlude: software defined transceivers should be in
every hacker toolbox; radio level attacks are otherwise invisible to
you. they are also useful for many other purposes, perhaps one day
even providing a solution to the untrustworthy proprietary firmware
and baseband systems crammed into every mobile device these days.]
incidentally, this also demonstrates why IOMMU / VT-d guest isolation
of devices on the host bus is very useful, as a vulnerable NIC could
otherwise provide complete access to privileged memory and interfaces
just like the baseband exploit above...  assuming your CPU itself is
"trusting trust" continues to be a persistent and difficult problem,
leaving us all vulnerable to some degree or another - it's just a
function of cost and skill to compromise.  turtles all the way down!

some questions, some answers, ...
this means rebuild hardened versions of these libraries from source;
  excluding insecure cipher suites in an OpenSSL build for example,
  altering architecture optimizations, supported features, in others,
the goal being that an exploit targeted to a vanilla distribution will
more likely fail with observable error or crash, rather than succeed
many exploits are very brittle in this respect, with any change in
symbol offsets or capabilities rendering them completely ineffective.
virtualization implies chained exploits for full compromise. combined
with the above you've drastically increased the cost of a successful
attack with modest effort. the likelihood of detection (by appearing
vulnerable yet not being so) is also increased.
remember that VMMs and hypervisors are themselves potentially
vulnerable software systems suitable for hardening and customization.
data exfiltration can be very visible via network behavior if you're
paying attention.  cross referencing connection state in your upstream
router vs. local OS view of sockets can identify discrepancies where
compromise has concealed covert connections. malware communicating
directly on an ethernet or wireless adapter outside of the OS is also
visible at this junction.
this is mostly a variant of  at a kernel / system level.  like
notepad.exe connecting to the internet, there are some syscall, file
access, and network requests which are clearly anomalous and
indicators of compromise.
this is a storied tangent unto itself...
last but not least: you must develop a routine of continuous hardening
and improvement. these steps are not done once and finished; they are
elements within a larger strategy of operational rigor defending

i've been contemplating a write up about this, but the problem is once
you advertise your methods they become less effective.
there really is "security through obscurity" in this sense; when at a
resource disadvantage, every little bit counts...
if i were to summarize what i have found effective against dedicated
and resourceful attackers (again, i can't go into details :) this
would be the top 5:
1. use a common distro, but rebuild critical components - bootloader,
initramfs, openssl, openssh, the kernel, gnutls, libgmp, use 64bit,
2. use isolation and RBAC, Qubes, VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels,
remember that VM escapes are available and expected. defense in depth
can never be too deep.
3. use constrained network access - identify anomalies, control
bandwidth, firewall ingress and egress aggressively. this implies
constant monitoring to detect such events. (another exercise left to
the reader)
4. rootkit and backdoor your own systems - use the dirty tricks to
observe and constrain your system before someone else uses dirty
tricks to compromise your system.
5. don't forget physical security - this is the universal oversight
and most effective end run around all other operational and technical
security measures. there is a reason physical access so often implies
"game over" and why black bag jobs are still and will continue to be
effective against all targets.
perhaps more later,

it is a question of private vs. public communication.
email is and will continue to be useful for public communication. this
gmail account indexes 190+ lists, 10,000 news alerts from scores of
filters (everything from "TS//SI//NF" to "Flame OR Gauss OR Duqu OR
Stuxnet" to GoldreichGoldwasserHalevi), a total of 643,132 pieces of
communication. i can search through all of it in seconds and apply new
filters to existing content just as easily as new, and keep an offline
backup just in case.
but there is zero i would consider private; for that use a medium of
communication that is not a usability failure, that is not a metadata
leakage nightmare, that is not an operational security mine field.

and to StealthMonger's point about latest generation mix networks for

that are resistant to traffic analysis and confirmation?
make them datagram based; utilize user space stacks and latest
research.  solving the low latency datagram anonymity problem enables
existing usable private communication with the additional benefit of
endpoint and peer anonymity.
i believe this possible to make useful, even if never infallible.
certainly more possible than the odds of making truly scalable,

metro Ethernet or municipal run fiber networks with peering are the
best option for mesh traffic relaying like this. ATM is too expensive;
IDSN, despite a proud origin story of the first data mix networks, is
also expensive, and super slow.
get rooftop access for radios in a Fresnel friendly internet exchange
where you can simply forward traffic down a few floors over Ethernet
and you're in the best of positions.
consumer fiber to the home would be great, if ToS restrictions didn't
make such forwarding risky.  and the business upgrade for FTTP is
pretty outrageous in almost every case.
you could route through a VPN provider or dedi server of your own in

@_subject: Re: UDP/datagram/cell based networks [was: Why_can't_email_be_secure] 
i should clarify:
the mode of operation for this presumed design and implementation is
to have SOCKS, HTTP, HTTPS, transparent UDP, transparent TCP,
transparent DNS (this is indeed different than just UDP :), and some
subset of transparent ICMP proxy support on the client / node.  you
could configure proxy settings, direct traffic to the trans ports, or
perform queries directly against the DNS port of the running real time
datagram mixer instance.
at the exits for public traffic or at the private ORCHID based
"hidden/overlay" endpoints, you transit these same protocols, per
advertised support in exit policy or overlay service capability
on the wire, you would be sending UDP datagrams that encapsulate the
NAT busting IPsec telescope containing path data, multi-path SCTP in
userspace for reliable TCP stream transport over the datagram overlay.
for all intents and purposes these packets would look like AH/ESP or
CryptoBox wrapped opaque cipher texts in some standard UDP
as for ATM, SONET, satellite data terminals, metro wireless, and all
other unusual or exotic transports: these are likely not useful for
the core network unless directly public UDP IPv4 reachable.
censorship bypass, non-node capable devices like phones, or very poor
network connectivity situations, would require other transports and
protocols for this initial tunnel into the overall real-time datagram
mix-like network.  in this context, the varied physical layers and
logical paths in a given metro region operating beneath IP routing can
play a role in passing traffic from suppressed/blocked users out to
the broader mesh or internet at large.
devices and users communicating via obfuscated links into the dgm
network do not have traffic analysis protections like full
participants.  despite this lack of stronger anonymity, the actors
observing at the edge can only note that you are tunneling into the
public network, and utilizing some stochastic gradient of bandwidth in
aggregate for some period of time.
this is still not much information, especially compared to the current
state of affairs!
there are many complications and constraints around how this would
work - i make it sound so easy ;)
  however, you could provide such services, including wireless metro
area mesh or p-to-mp distribution networks, constrained by propinquity
and referral by reputation, in combination with broadband internet
uplink of a more traditional sort where available.
and in fact, using multiple paths / transports concurrently provides
advantage for data continuity and throughput despite volatile and
changing upstream link availability on an individual basis to
particular gateway or router or access point devices.
metro area mesh benefits nicely from some backhaul ad-hoc or fixed
plant high capacity point-to-point links over distance with short IP
routes; there is a good paper from early 2000's about using atheros
802.11a devices with a custom tertiary firmware and host driver to
bond eight devices into a single point-to-point link with an aggregate
throughput over three or four hundred megabit a second in transport
rate... or so i recall.  IPoATM on a OC12 or bigger to an internet
provider would absolutely be useful as an upstream sink within such a

there are some interesting tidbits in this release:
"The agency had asked for the new power as early as 1999, the

contact chaining and analysis may have been done on Americans

i find it interesting that this request occurred the same time that
core collection on US backbone links at Sprint was under development.
Sprint provided the perfect initial test as their ATM infrastructure,
and IPoATM data networks, were the most challenging environment for
deep packet inspection. (Solve it for Sprint, it can be applied

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Attorney General Michael B.

not constitutionally protected, N.S.A. analysts could use such
information without regard to the nationality or location of the

It is a repository into which vast amounts of data flow daily from the

The documents show that significant amounts of information from the
United States go into Mainway. An internal N.S.A. bulletin, for

A top-secret document titled Better Person Centric Analysis
describes how the agency looks for 94 entity types, including phone

correlates 164 relationship types to build social networks and what
the agency calls community of interest profiles, using queries like

and this is interesting in both scale and technical detail on the

@_subject: Belgacom Hack (EN translation) 
/
 On the brink of catastrophe (2013-09-21)
Ping. It's Friday the 13th. Around 11 o'clock in the morning, the IT
consultants that Belgacom employs at its largest customers in the
private and public sector receive a message. The message doesn't say
much, except for an urgent request to cancel all appointments of that
forenoon. An "emergency conference call" will take place instead.
The news that is brought in that call makes the IT consultants gasp
for breath.  A piece of malicious software has been found on the
network of BICS, a daughter company of Belgacom. It is hard to grasp
even for well-informed insiders. The BICS network is so wide and deep
that it is promptly clear to everybody that this is not just a Belgian
problem. This problem is at least of European proportions. Because
whoever controls BICS, controls the communication of a large part of
the world. "This could have been larger than 9/11", says one source
who closely followed the case. Without a grain of irony.
The pressure on the teams of the Dutch digital defender Fox-IT, that
started cleaning up together with an army of Belgacom employees last
weekend, was enormous.
It was their second attempt, various sources confirm. A first attempt
to remove the villainous software from the infected computers at
Belgacom in the last weekend of August was cancelled. "At the time,
not all conditions were met required to remove everything at once", it
was said. Some computers turned out to run the alternative operating
system Linux, known of the penguin logo, not Windows. "The risk was
too big that we could not remove everything at once.  In that case you
should not touch it. Or the adversary will know that the virus has
been found", states someone politically involved.
Strict conditions
The investigation of the hacking started on July 19th, when Belgacom
went to court. During their work, investigators at the intelligence
services, police and justice were very wary of a leak about the entire
operation. In early September they informed the Belgian cabinet on
strict conditions: the list of attendees of that meeting was kept
closely. If a politician would have wanted to reveal the news before
the malware was dealt with, the investigators would press charges for
breach of confidentiality of the investigation. "We could not risk
everything going wrong due to someone talking", it is said.
Belgacom was not infected with some common viruses, but with very
professional malware that costed lots of money to develop. "We had to
re-invent ourselves to do this", an investigator said. "In other
investigations there is a fixed idea of where you're going, but in in
this case it was continuously starting over because it was so
difficult to get a grasp of the malware".
Gradually it became clear that the hackers are not only interested in
the communications in the Middle-East, where BICS holds a solid
position via South-African minority shareholder MTN. "They have been
looking around and took what they could", state sources involved in
the investigation. They are clear about one thing: the attack
originated from the United States. "We determine that by the signature
of the malware, but especially by where the trails lead.  They
partially run through the UK. We think the US is the main destination.
And the past weeks at the US Embassy, you notice some embarrassment
when you request exchange of information." Yesterday, the German
weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported that the UK intelligence service
GCHQ (Government Communications Headquartes) are responsible for the
attacks. It based that claim on slides disclosed by whistleblower
Edward Snowden. The news that GCHQ is behind the Belgacom attack is a
surprise to at least the services working on the affair.
The malware could do anything
The malware at Belgacom actually consists of a complex system of
complementary viruses. They are all connected. If a problem is
imminent or if they are detected, they can signal each other. "It is
somewhat like a human virus, which also mutates continuously", states
someone involved who monitors the situation for his service.  "For
example, one part is responsible for searching and storing
information, while another part is continuously looks for pathways to
the internet to transfer information. Other pieces of code are
responsible for circumventing firewalls, or carry out surveillance.
If someone detects the hacking or attempts to remove a part of it, the
virus that is acting as a guard promptly signals the other parts.
Because you don't know what the malware is capable of, everything can
go horribly wrong at the last step."
The cost of the entire detection and cleaning operation is
correspondingly high. Fox-IT, the Dutch cyber security/defence company
that is commissioned by Belgacom to first make inventory of the
problems and then solve them, is a familiar name. "For the first two
weeks they estimated the costs to be one million euro", states a
well-placed source. And then adds that the entire operation lasted ten
weeks. Moreover, Fox-IT did not expect that, at a certain point, it
had to allocate all of its employees to this case. A price tag of over
five million euro, then? "It won't be far off."
But what was so terrifying about this cyber attack? And why the panic
that something would go wrong? Telephone data about conversations with
countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria that disappear, how
could that have such an impact? They are 'just' stolen phone data,
right? The involved expert sitting opposite us, looks dead serious.
There is drama in his voice, but considering the contents of what he
says, that is not unjustified. "This was highly performing malware and
it was present in the nerve centre of communications.  Anything that a
highly privileged network operator of Belgacom could do, this system
could do as well. I don't have to make a drawing of it? It had all the
keys, all the passwords and full control. We must dare to classify
this as a big crisis. This could have been a catastrophe. And people
don't seem to realize."
Sensitive customers
Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to make that drawing. BICS calls itself a
"wholesale carrier". Two words, four syllables, but behind it is a
network that spans the entire globe and the beating heart of which is
located in our capital, Brussels. BICS provides the hardware
infrastructure that carries internet traffic, phone conversations,
text messages and mobile data of telecom companies and government
institutions. And the more sensitive the customer, the more likely he
is the end up at BICS. The daughter company of Belgacom markets itself
with the argument that they never ever look at what travels over its
cables. "We provide the cables for you, and you just send whatever you
want over them", is what it basically boils down to.
A glance at the list of BICS' customers makes one dizzy. The financial
transport center Swift, Electrabel, bpost, Belgocontrol, they are all
connected to BICS.  The NATO in Evere, the European Commission and
Parliament, SHAPE, the Supreme Headquerters Allied Powers Europe, in
Bergen; BICS, BICS, BICS. Even the headquarters of the NATO Allied Air
Command, in Ramstein, Germany, from where the 2011 air attacks on
Libya where coordinated, depends on BICS. Among the military, it is
pointed out that military communications has an extra layer of
security; but that pointing-out happens with a degree of humility that
is very unusual to the military.  "Every organisation, not just the
government, must now begin to wonder whether it is dependent of one
single provider, of one single network. And specially how well it is
secured itself", states someone who was at the front row of the
affair. "Belgacom, that is critical infrastructure. How can Belgium
keep running without it? Those are the questions that we must ask now.
 Because the organisation responsible for the attack has in fact the
capability to completely disrupt Belgacom and BICS." A different
source confirms, reluctantly, the doom scenarios: "You can't think of
it. It would be larger than 9/11. The planes would pretty much fall
out of the sky." As a figure of speech?  "Hm, yeah."
A governmental source points out the consequences of even a limited
disruption of phone communications and internet. "If a crisis occurs,
what is the first thing a human does? Grasp their phone. Imagine that
that lifeline is lost.  Not just for you, but also for the emergency
services, hospital, the fire department...? And for the police? At
first glance it isn't, because they use the Astrid network [a Belgian
national radio communications network intended for emergency
services].  But that network only works apart from BICS for local
communications.  For interregional communications it is just as
dependent on BICS as the rest. Hence, it is no coincidence that police
chief Catherine De Bolle started looking for a backup for the
communications system of the federal police on that Friday the 13th,
just before the big cleaning operation would have started.
How long would it take before Belgacom was up and running again after
a destructive cyber attack, is unclear. "But it is clear that we are
not prepared to counter this type of attacks right now", states a
high-ranking source. "That awareness must finally start to grow. I am
very apprehensive for the feeling of relief that I already observe in
some people. 'Ah well, that has been nicely dealt with. It's over.'
It's not, mind you. Whoever doesn't realise, this week, that it is
urgent, will never get it. Playing things down now is dangerous."
After De Standaard brought the news of large-scale hacking at
Belgacom, it turned out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the
cabinet of the prime minister had been hacked. "And this is merely the
top of the iceberg", states a source who was involved in the problems
at Belgacom.  Because telecom is one thing, but there are many other
critical sectors that are the fundament of a country. Transportation,
for example. Trains, trams, busses, highways, airplanes, everything
involves computer networks and everywhere one should be cautious for
cyber attacks. The energy supply is another critical fundament. And
last but not least: the banking sector of a country. Luxembourg has
already contacted the Belgian cyberservices [?] to obtain more
information about the malware that hit Belgacom.
Besides budgets and well-paid IT personnel, the remedy against the
growing cyberthreat will be found in improved awareness. "Belgium
wants to invest in knowledge and innovation, but if one sector is
vulnerable to espionage, it is that one. Just as many computers of the
global diplomatic network of Foreign Affairs have post-its one them
with the passwords, many small companies are slacking in their
security", a cyber specialist states. "And if you dare ask whether
their Chinese interns are thoroughly screened, they look at you as if
you're from another planet." Whether the gravity of the situation is
apparent to everyone, is doubtful. In official communications,
Belgacom states that it currently has no evidence of impact on its
customers or their data.  Understandly, the company does not want to
trigger hysteria, but it sounds like down-playing nonetheless. "What
should we write then?", states spokesman Jan Margot in his response.
"The infection was at dozens of computers in our own system. They have
been cleaned together with the entire network."
BICS too doesn't say much about it. "There are no indications of an
impact on the telecomnetwork of BICS", it states in a press release.
"A number of our IT systems are integrated in the infrastructure of
Belgacom and are affected in that way, but that remained outside the
network that carries customer traffic."
"That's all put rather euphemistically", according to the
investigators involved.  "But you cannot accuse them of lying. A lot
of thought went into every comma of the communication."
Did Belgium become the joke of de European mainland as a result of the
compromise of Belgacom? Intelligence services are continuously in
contact with each other and exchange information. For the image of our
country, the past week has been anything but stellar, but it is
emphasised nonetheless that in such contacts it is often also about
personal relations between people. "Moreover, all countries have
problems and everyone tries to rise above them."
What about ethics? Isn't it schizophrenic that our country, Belgium,
receives information about threats that the US or others have stolen
from us? "That is the eternal paradox", a recipient of such
information states. Diplomatically it is the hardest. But if you
receive information about a serious threat such as terrorism, you
cannot ignore it. Then you have different things on your mind.

orienting yourself in a large code base:

toolkits are common for, the language at hand.
1. filter all the third party components and sources out. these are
not interesting.
2. keyword search for password handling, private keys, hardcoded secrets, etc.
3. keyword search for the public interfaces of interest, or API calls
exposed, etc.
4. keyword search for business specific terms, e.g. where does the
meat of their business logic reside?

robust defense is based on realistic threats,
 and realistic threats are identified via attackers' perspective.
i've been diving down this rabbit hole since before i challenged
covert FLTINFOWARCEN members* to "get as blackhat on this motherfucker

i started down this path when i realized that robust peer to peer
systems must protect each node to the highest degree required by any
participant. it's the opposite of pandering to the "lowest common
on the plus side, once you have addressed security for the "most
stringent requirement" all other systems and peers enjoy the benefit
of this elevated level of protection.
the bad news is that attacks continue to improve, and i'm no where
near satisfied in my ability to protect my own systems against the
capabilities myself and my peers have at their disposal.
the vast majority of infosec is useless bullshit, the vast majority of
infosec conferences are pandering crap; the whole industry

for better or for worse (mostly better) these systems have made their
way into release package builds and production deployment processes.
i'm speaking in generalities here, for various reasons, but common
trajectories include:
- obtaining the private keys or http auth passwords for access to
source code repositories.
- obtaining ssh private keys for access to other systems, e.g. remote
build hosts or even production hosts.
- obtaining kerberos/ldap/http/* auth credentials for bug reporting
systems, release code signing, or other facilities.
- obtaining access to datacenter or operations automation: cfengine,
chef, puppet, etc. these are really useful ;)
- obtaining test automation tools and other "QA" hooks with elevated
access and fewer controls.
- privilege escalation on the CI host which in turn is often
whitelisted and useful as further pivot.
- providing example usage for invocation of and command line
parameters for custom internal software.
- providing excellent watering hole "infection vector" for technical
staff in an org. e.g. taking over engineering workstations.
from here you've got everything you need to infiltrate an entire organization.
the source code provides "hard coded" keys/passwords or pointers to
files where interesting bits lay,
the conduit to engineering systems which grant access to public facing
services and data stores,
the credentials and access for all operational concerns,
the org is your oyster...

if you decide to play this game, the "red teaming"

 you're of sufficient value and legitimacy,

 you see escalation to some very inventive levels...

@_subject: Re: [cryptography] urandom vs random 
this is a good analogy :)
for best effective performance, it seems memory bus(es) constrains the
optimal transmission unit size.
4k extended instructions providing more throughput than repeated
instructions at 512bit chunks.
the worst case scenarios, you're passing entropy directly into AES
native instructions, and/or onward to PCIe lanes...
you keep coming back to this assumption that RDRAND is entirely
trusted and always available.
consider adding additional entropy sources like USB keys, scavengers
like Dakarand or Haveged, and so forth.
conversely to your argument, there is no harm in aggressively mixing a
large pool with a high rate hardware entropy source. if you are one of
the worst case scenarios, like seeding an entire new volume for full
disk encryption with entropy, then you can manage accordingly and cut
out the OS level, kernel pool middle man, system call boundary, and
other overhead accordingly.
but not effectively expensive!
again, i find very few the situations in which my modern processor is
unable to keep a properly refilled aggressively reseeded /dev/random
up to any demanded rate of consumption for high speed network
services, common client side uses, most key generation, and so forth.
if you are one of the worst case scenarios, like seeding an entire new
volume for full disk encryption with entropy, then you can manage
accordingly and cut out the OS level, kernel pool middle man, system
call boundary, and other overhead
fair enough, but consider the inverse, particularly for a skeptical
audience knowing what we do now:
why not mix aggressively with multiple sources if you have the CPU budget?
why not provide access to the raw, un-mixed, un-encrypted,
un-whitened, un-obfuscated state of the raw entropy bits for those so
inclined to use it in such a manner?
efforts to drive RDRAND into direct use instead of the kernel entropy
pool in the linux kernel,
efforts to steadfast refuse access to the raw entropy stream,
are thus viewed with elements of suspicion and provide an air of lack
of credibility.
even with all of these concerns, i have publicly said and will
continue to assert, using RDRAND is better than nothing. the current
state of entropy on most operating systems and especially virtual
machine environments on these operating systems, is very poor.
it is just a shame this resource cannot be used to greater utility and
confidence, as would be provided, were raw access be available.

he can't say much about specifics, remember?
see above regarding technical vs. non-technical.  for the high ups,
getting access to encrypted communication is "breaking encryption".
whether that is breaking by cooperative agreement and new hardware, or
breaking by new attacks on crypto primitives themselves, it is
indistinguishable to them but makes all the difference to us.
to walk through with rough ballpark but by no means representative numbers,
- modern CPU - 1,500 to 9,000 sessions per second
- "typical web 2.0 service provider"
  - SSL ops: 800k/min, 13,333/sec (no keep-alive)
  - Bandwidth: 24kB/s or 200kbps (no CDN)
verdict: medium to large internet sites can offload SSL/TLS to their
front-end load balancers or servers without much effort. crypto
accelerators no longer required (unless used for HSM protection of
server keys). Google proved this.
now do the math for OC48 passive drops feeding the DPI collectors:
- for sake of argument, consider just 5% of channel capacity using
SSL/TLS: 2.5Gb / 20 == 125Mb/sec
- for sake of argument, consider 5k/sec sessions per 200kbps (gloss

- 125Mb/200kb= 625 times more load than our provider example above
with 3.1mm sessions/sec.
verdict: you need a rack of servers at each collection point just to
extract keys for the DPI sniffer.
summary: NSA "breakthrough" at the Multiprogram Research Facility, or
Building 5300, is a system for the real-time recovery of session keys
from public key exchanges, which do not implement forward secrecy, the
session keys then used for DPI of SSL/TLS traffic. (AES faster and

conveniently enough the real-time support can be applied retroactively

systems employed by not only governments around the world but also
many average computer users". That sounds a lot like saying that the

two things,
1) i suspect a system to introduce realistically viable biases
expected with a particular TRNG design is more complicated than you
assume (especially when performing long running analysis over a large
corpus, not trivial / short checks like FIPS.)  it would certainly be
much larger on die, but perhaps that is beside the point.
2) this underscores the need to combine multiple entropy sources, and
not put all your all trust in one built in instruction.
the gist of you argument is correct, however, the microcode itself is
a block box, just as suspect as other instructions, given enough
resources and privileged access.

none of these are compelling reasons to not release raw access to the
entropy stream from hardware noise sources.*
clearly you have done your homework, and the design, _if trusted_, is
a good one. however, denying access to the raw sources prevents any
evaluation that the entropy sources are indeed operating as designed,
and prevents any mode of operation where independent entropy
estimates, mixing, and host/application pool seeding is possible.
and surely you, when considering the point of view of an attacker, can
recognize the immense value of modes (RDRAND, RDSEED) which provide
only the obfuscated output to callers of these instructions.
last but not least, you take these criticisms as personal attack. i
have not seen anyone attack you personally. in fact, you simply do not
have the clearance nor indoctrination to be trusted with such a
backdoor.  as per the leaked documents, early access to these designs
is used to develop backdoors, exploits, and other surreptitious access
available when the product is.
keeping you in the dark, and enjoying your passionate rebuttals to

it is interesting how these fundamentals change across public key

symmetric ciphers are a particular beast... (and combined
authentication and encryption modes even more particular ;)
in a poor implementation or protocol, re-keying can provide an
opportunity for cipher suite downgrade or other privacy destroying
effective frequent re-keying requires the other INFOSEC/OPSEC
dependencies be met!
note that for all intents and purposes, you should use a fresh,
absolutely random key for each re-keying.  key "stretching" or
derivation methods suffer the same types of vulnerabilities over large
enough output that the original cipher does.
instead of spending your time trying to securely "stretch" a few keys,
just generate a large number of perfectly random keys instead!

this also is useful for constraining the duration of an authenticated session.
if you must "attest" to the authenticated status of an entity at a

access to the protected resource within milliseconds of a "panic"
event occurring.

you're wrong.
the key is to re-key so frequently there is never a significant volume
transferred under the same symmetric key.
in the manually keyed IPsec experiment i mentioned in another thread,
we used synchronized key daemons to maintain a rolling pair of
SA/AH+ESP associations that rotated on a per second interval.
as long as you didn't transfer more than some obtuse number of
terabits in a given second the assurance provided by a random key is
intact. (and we used VIA C5P dual RNG processors to provide the manual
keying material that was kept in sync between a pair of communicating
stations over unencrypted 802.11b - there was no IKE or other public
key exchange, just synchronized symmetric ciphers and digests)

"Westward the Course of Empire - Part 1"
A talk given by Eben Moglen at Columbia Law School on October 9th, 2013
  WebM: mp4: Good afternoon.
There is no introduction. After 26 years in this place it feels
ridiculous to me to pretend that anyone is especially honored by my
presence here.
If I am to be frank about it, I invited myself. Not in the way that
Edward Snowden invited himself to Sheremetyevo Airport. Nor in the way
that Julian Assange invited himself to the Ecuadorian embassy in
London. Surely not in the way that Chelsea Manning invited herself to
35 years in Fort Leavenworth. No, law professor-like I have assigned
myself no onerous duties. I undertook nothing more than to come here
and to tell you the truth.
I don't wish to force my ideas on anybody, but the truth is that I
feel forced to speak myself. No one will remember much of what I have
to say, but of the things about which I came here to speakboth those
that have been done and those that remain to be doneI must say that
they will never be forgotten.
In the third chapter of his History of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon gives two reasons why the slavery into
which the Romans tumbled under Augustus and his successors left them
more wretched than any previous human slavery.
In the first place, Gibbon said, the Romans had carried with them into
slavery the culture of a free peopletheir language and their
conception of themselves as human beings presupposed freedom. And
thus, Gibbons says, oppressed as they were by the weight of their
corruption and military violence, the Romans yet preserved for a long
time the sentiments, or at least the ideas, of a freeborn people. In
the second place, the empire of the Romans filled all the world, and
when that empire fell into the hands of a single person, the world was
a safe and dreary prison for his enemies. As Gibbon says, to resist
was fatal, and it was impossible to fly.
The power of that Roman Empire rested in its control of
communications. The Mediterranean Sea, which was the transit hub of
every western civilization, was their lake. And across their European
empire, from Scotland to Syria, they pushed the roadsroads that
fifteen centuries later were still primary arteries of European
transportation. Down those roads which, as Gibbon says, rendered every
corner of the Empire pervious to Roman power, the Emperor marched his
armies. But up those roads he gathered his intelligence. Augustus
invented the posts: first for signals intelligence, to move couriers
and messages at the fastest possible speeds; and then for human
intelligence. He created the post-chaises, so that, as Gibbon says,
those who were present when dispatches were written could be
questioned by the Emperor. Using that infrastructure for control of
communications, with respect to everything that involved the
administration of power, the Emperor of the Romans made himself the
best informed human being in the history of the world.
That power eradicated human freedom. "Remember," says Cicero to
Marcellus in exile, "wherever you are, you are equally within of the
power of conqueror."
The empire of the United States, the global empire that followed from
victory in the Second World War, also depended upon control of
communications. Possibly the greatest military lesson of the Second
World War was that he who has access to his adversaries' military
communications prevails. At every level, from the tactical artillery
duel to the greatest strategic naval confrontations in the Pacific,
the new pace of warfare gave victory to the one who knew the other
side's plans first.
This was all the more obviously crucial in the development of the
power to rule the world when, a mere twenty years later, the empire of
the United States was locked in a confrontation of nuclear
annihilation with the Soviet empirea war of submarines hidden in the
dark below the continents, capable of eradicating human civilization
in less than an hour in an imperial confrontation whose rule of
engagement was "launch on warning." Thus it was that the Empire of the
United States came to have precisely the same view of the effort to
render everywhere pervious to American power that had been the view of
Emperor Augustus. And our listeners aspired to everything.
Now, the structure of listening which came out of the Second World
Warthe spying on signals, the stealing of signals and the breaking of
codesthis was, under everybody's understanding of the new order of
power in the world, the crucial center of it all. And, while it has
been commonplace to recognize since the end of the Cold War that the
United States has spent for decades as much on its military might as
all other powers in the world combined, it has not necessarily
followed in people's consciousness that we applied to the stealing of
signals and the breaking of codes a similar proportion of our
That system of listening, which had at its center the same reality of
power, that system which grew up under the National Security Act and
its successor legislation in the United States, had a particular
systemic form: listening was under military command, controlling large
civilian workforces. That structure, of course, presupposed precisely
the foreign intelligence nature of the activity. Military control was
both a symbol and a guarantee of the nature of the activity being
pursued: everybody understood that if you had put such activity
domestically under military control you would have violated the
fundamental principle of the civilian control of the government of the
United States.
Instead what we had was a foreign intelligence service regarded as the
most important basis of American power, responsible to the chief
executive of the United States as commander-in-chief, and based in
military control and military integrity. Because, of course, integrity
was the other side of this coin. Military control ensured absolute
command deference with respect to the fundamental principle which made
it all "all right," which was: "No Listening Here." The boundary
between home and away was the boundary between absolutely permissible
and absolutely impermissiblebetween the world in which those whose
job it is to kill people and break things instead stole signals and
broke codes, and the constitutional system of ordered liberty.
There's lots to be saidand we will need to say it as our time
together goes byabout the morality of that assumption. But I must ask
you to keep in mind that it also was accompanied by the reality of
communications in the twentieth century, which were hierarchically
organized and very often state-controlled. When the United States
Government chose to listen to other governments abroadto their
militaries, to their diplomatic communications, to their policy-makers
where they couldthey were listening in a world of defined targets. As
to which they were roughly entitled to their favored assumption, which
was that everybody else was listening back at them on those targets
pretty much just as hard as they could, which was of course way less
hard than we, because we were the Empire. On this basis, we formed
fundamental alliances with the other English-speaking societies in the
world for a complete cooperation of signals intelligence, based around
two fundamental predicates: the listeners in each of the English
speaking societies were not listening at home, and they were not
spying on one another. Therefore they and we stood back to back in
their listening against the world. And on that basis, in the era of
the digital computer, we began to be capable of taking everything.
"Everything" was defined as all signals in the electromagnetic
spectrum and its copper wire accessories. The basic principle was:
hack, tap, stealwhere the roof of every US embassy, and every
American naval asset at sea, and every other place that we could cram
antennas held the ones that we wanted to have there. And where every
deal that we could make for exchange of signals intelligence among
parties committed to listening gave us everything. Thus we could get
what we needed, and we felt we needed it all.
In the beginning we listened to militaries and their governments.
Later we monitored the flow of international trade as far as it
engaged American national security interests.
But there is this about the weapons of war: In 1937, bombing civilian
populations from the air was an innovation in the criminality of war,
and Pablo Picasso found it worthy of his work. Less than a decade
later, dozens of the greatest cities in the world lay in rubble and
United States Government had dropped nuclear weapons on cities in
Japan. Now the United States Government considers aerial bombardment
to be the cleanest form of war.
In the beginning we listened to armies, embassies, diplomats,
government officials. Then we listened to the global economy. Now we
are being told that spying on entire societies is normal.
The regime that we built to defend ourselves against nuclear
annihilation, in a world where access to the other fellow's signals is
what makes victory, came at the end of the twentieth century under two
forms of profound social restructuring. In the first place, the Cold
War ended and the Soviet Union dissolved. An entire establishment of
national securitywhich continues to absorb more resources in the
United States than in all the rest of the world put together, and I am
including the listenersan entire national security structure
re-purposed itself, not to spy upon an empire with twenty-five
thousand nuclear weapons pointed down our throats, but at the entire
population of the world in order to locate a few thousand people
minded to various kinds of mass murder.
In the second place, the nature of human communication changed. The
system that they built, with all of its arrangements, was dependent as
I said upon fixed targets: a circuit, a phone number, a license plate,
a locale. The question of capacity was about how many targets you
could simultaneously follow in a world where each of them required
hack, tap, steal. But what happened at the beginning of the
twenty-first century was that we acquired a new way of communicating
in the human racethe beginning of the beginning of the beginning of
the nervous system we are building in which each human being is a
neuron in that great hive-mind called humanity. And from the moment we
began to do that, two things began to fail: the simplicity of "one
target one circuit" went away, and the difference between inside and
outside vanished too.
In particular it vanished in the United States, because so much of the
intelligence of the brain being built for humanity, for better and for
worse, resided here. Therefore the question "do we listen inside?"
came to seem like a question about "are we going to lose the ability
to listen at all?" About which, of course, fundamental doctrine of
national securitywhatever "national security" meanshad only one
acceptable answer.
Into this mixture, of the structures of the twentieth-century imperial
power and the reality of twenty-first century technology, a vastly
imprudent American administration then intervened.
Whatever else, history will record of them that they didn't think long
before acting. Presented with a national calamity which also
constituted a political opportunity, nothing stood between them and
all the mistakes that haste can make for history to repent at leisure.
And what they did, of coursein secret, with the assistance of judges
chosen by a single man operating in secrecy, and with the connivance
of many decent people who believed themselves to be doing the only
thing that would save the societywas to unchain the listeners from
Not only had circumstances destroyed the simplicity of "no listening
inside," not only had fudging with the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act carried them into the land where law no longer
provided them with useful landmarks, but they wanted to do itlet's be
frank, they wanted to do it. Their view of the nature of human power
was Augustan if not august. They wanted what it is forbidden to wise
people to take unto themselves. And so they fell, and we fell with
Our journalists failed. The New York Times allowed the 2004 election
not to be informed by things that it knew, having made a decision
which, no matter how many Pulitzer prizes it goes on to win, will
always be a pain in our recollections (if not elsewhere).
We failed collectively to show any outrage, because we were afraid. We
did not demand the end at the beginning. And now we're a long way in.
We had our Guernica and we paid little attention. And there weren't
any limits anymore. They were living in an evolving net, with
conscriptable digital brains gathering intelligence on all the human
race for mere purposes of bagatelle and capitalism. So they perverted
those places. And to the network operators we gave legal immunity in
the United States for complicity, thus easing the way further.
Then, there began a revolt inside.
In Hong Kong, during his brief career as a public thinker and
speakerwhich I commend to your attention and which we will spend much
time talking about in future times togetherin his career as a public
commentator, Edward Snowden said a very straightforward and useful
thing; he said, analysts are not bad people, and they don't want to
think of themselves that way, but they came to calculate that if a
program produced anything useful, then it was justified.
Because, of course, it was not their job to weigh the fundamental
morality. Which is too bad, because the people whose job it was to
weigh the fundamental morality failed more bitterly than we, and our
journalists, and our everybody else.
They fell, and we fell with them, because they refused to accept that
there is a morality of freedom. And it was the people who worked for
them who felt their failure first. So, from the middle of the first
decade of the twenty-first century, people began to blow whistles all
over the field.
Those courageous people sacrificed their careers, frightened
themselves, sometimes suffered personal destruction, to say that there
was something deeply wrong. Later I shall try and show you both how
they came to those conclusions and what they tried to say. But it is
sufficient for the moment to say that what happened back was: Rule By
Fear. It will be sufficient to say that, in their unwisdom, those who
believed in the importance of the listeners and their activities
sought to deal with those who blew the whistle by the harshest
possible treatment.
It is unfortunate to have to dwell on the extent of the failures, once
the morality of freedom was no longer part of their world. Mr. Snowden
said in Hong Kong that he was sacrificing himselfwhich he knew he was
doingin order to save the world from a system like this one
constrained only by policy documents. Next time we meet we shall think
long and hard about the political ideas of Edward Snowdenthey are
worthy of your respect and your deep consideration. But for now, once
again, it will be sufficient to say that he was not exaggerating the
nature of the difficulty.
Because of Mr. Snowden, we now know that the listeners, in their
aggressive effort to maintain the security of the United States by
breaking anything that stands in the way of listening, undertook to do
what they repeatedly promised respectable opinion in the trade they
would never do.
Systematically, they attempted what they had once and for all promised
many a time in the discreetest but most credible fashion to
respectable opinion, which then carried their water for them
throughout our world. They always said they would not attempt breaking
the crypto which secures the global financial system.
That was false.
When, on September 6th, the New York Times re-entered the pursuit of
journalism in this area so triumphantly, by revealing the existence of
Bull Run, publishing Mr. Snowden's various disclosures concerning both
the substance of Bull Run and the National Security Agency's
discussions of it, we learned that the United States listeners had
been systematically and deliberately trying to subvert the crypto that
holds the international financial system together, for years. And we
learned a good deal morewhich we shall spend more time upon on
another evening, considering carefully what we learned in this
respectwe learned that their efforts had been so far only partially
Within hours they had forfeited respectable opinion around the world,
which had stood solidly in their corner all the way along. The
recklessness of what they had done, and the danger to which it put the
people in the world who don't accept danger from the United States
Government, was breathtaking.
When the morality of freedom is so thoroughly thrown away, it isn't
only the "little people" of the world who suffer, but they do.
The empire of the United States, the one that secured itself by
listening to everything, was the empire of exported liberty. What we
had to offer all around the world was freedomafter colonization,
after European theft, after the forms of twentieth-century horror we
haven't even talked about yetwe offered liberty; we offered freedom.
In the twentieth century we were prepared to sacrifice many of the
world's great cities, and to accept the sacrifice of tens of millions
of human lives, in order to secure our selves against forms of
government we called "totalitarianism," in which the State grew so
powerful and so invasive that it recognized no longer any border of
private life, and brought itself into everything that its subjects
did. Where the State listened to every telephone conversation, and
kept a list of everybody every troublemaker knew.
So let us unfortunately tell the truth as it appeared to the people
who worked in the system: When the morality of freedom was withdrawn,
our State began fastening the procedures of totalitarianism on the
substance of democratic society.
There is no historical precedent for the proposition that the
procedures of totalitarianism are compatible with the system of
enlightened, individual, democratic self-governance. No one has ever
previously in the history of the human race evolved an argumentand as
I will show next time no argument can be evolvedthat would give us
any confidence in the ability of the procedures of totalitarianism to
coexist with those of constitutional democratic self-governance. It is
enough to say for now that omnipresent invasive listening creates
fear. And I need not be Justice Brandeis to tell you that fear is the
enemy of reasoned, ordered liberty.
It is, of course, utterly inconsistent with the American ideal to
attempt to fasten the procedures of totalitarianism on American
constitutional self-governance. And this summer many of my dear
colleagues and comrades in our movement have spent much of time in the
United States pointing out that all of this is deeply is inconsistent
with some important American right not to be listened to. Which right
I too have, with them, and believe in deeply. But which it is not my
point primarily to assert just this moment. Partly, as I shall suggest
next time, because freedom is merely privilege extended unless enjoyed
by one and all. But primarily because there is an even deeper
inconsistency between American ideals and the subjection of every
other society on earth to the procedures of totalitarianism.
Freedom hath been hunted round the globe. Asia and Africa have long
expelled her. Europe has been bullied into treating her like a
stranger and England would take her into detention at Heathrow should
she arrive. The President of the United States has ordered everyone
not to receive the fugitive, and to prepare in time an asylum for
You see how it works when you rewrite Tom Paine without the morality
of freedom. And so our primary problem right now is that we allowed
them to export slavery to the world. All of which, in one form or
another, became clear, in one mind after another, within the bowels of
the empire and its listeners over the last decade.
William Binneywith whom we shall spend some time along the waysaid
in a public speech "I left the NSA because the systems that I built
were turned against you. We had a legitimate charter in foreign
intelligence gathering, but then they went and turned those systems
against youI didn't mean it, but they did it."
People began to understand within the system that it was being
sustained against democratic order, not with it. Because they knew
that what had come unmoored had come unmoored in the dark, and was
sailing without a flag. They were good people, and they began to
break. And when they broke, the system broke them back. In the end, at
least so far, until tomorrow, there was Mr. Snowden, who saw
everything that happened and watched what happened to the others.
He understood, as Chelsea Manning also always understood, that when
you wear the uniform you consent to the power. He knew his business
very well. Young as he was, as he said in Hong Kong, "I've been a spy
all my life," and I believe him. And so he did what you have to have
great courage to do, wherever you are, in the presence of what you
believe to be radical injustice. He wasn't first, he won't be last,
but he sacrificed his life to tell us things we needed to know.
Edward Snowden committed espionage on behalf of the human race.
Knowing the price, knowing the reason, knowing that it wouldn't be up
to him whether sacrificing his life was worth it.
So I would think that our most important effort, first, is to
understand the message: to understand its context, to understand its
purpose, to know its meaning, and to experience the consequences of
having received the communication.
Others will of course regard the first imperative as being to
eliminate the message, and the messenger, and the meaning: to render
everything as invisible as possible. Because invisibility is where
listeners have to live in order to work. But I think we must let them
go about that business. We must let them try to obliterate the message
as best they can, and do our work, which is the work of understanding
It will be difficult to judge, when you come to the moment where you
consider yourself either entitled or obliged to begin doing so. The
reason that it will be difficult to judge is that there is always much
to say on both sides when someone is greatly right too soon.
In the United States, those who were "premature anti-fascists"
suffered later. It was right to be right when all others were right.
And it was wrong to be right when only the people we didn't want to be
were already there.
I need not explain to you that it is possible to consider a man a
terrorist who tried to do too soon what we took four years and 750,000
lives in order to achieve, namely to free the slaves. And I do not
need to explain to you why it is that Gibbon considered the master key
to the tender respect of Augustus for a free constitution, which he
had destroyed, to be his fear.
The death of Caesar was always before his eyes, says Gibbon, and this
shaped his principles in politics. Augustus was sensible, says Gibbon,
that mankind is ruled by names; and he was not deceived in his
expectation that the Senate and the Romans would submit to slavery, so
long as they were respectfully assured that they kept all their
ancient freedom.
So there are some pieces that we need to put together in order to
understand. In the first place we must see the politics of now, both
as Mr. Snowden saw it, thus bringing us the message we must live with,
and as we see it in ourselves.
We shall consider, next time, the politics of our condition. I shall
suggest to you that it lies in this: if we are not doing anything
wrong, we have a right to resist. The nature of our freedom is that we
lose it because we do not exercise it. And the nature of our freedom
is not necessarily the one we find only in the books of law.
We shall consider two constitutional traditions in the United States
next time. One made by European people running away to be free and one
made by African people, forced into slavery, who had to run away, in
the United States, in order to be free. Two constitutional traditions
of resistancedifferently structured and equally in our bones.
Now we must consider the relation that we have to the rest of the
human race in this, and ask ourselves whether we are seeking privilege
or something that belongs to all of humankind. For which it will be
necessary to understand the ideas of those who have risked their lives
to inform us, not because their ideas are necessarily privileged above
our own, but because they have sad experience from which to speak.
We must think about the role of all those working people in the
systems, both private and public, which constitute spying on humanity.
We must ask what they are telling us in their resistance and what our
side in their resistance ought to be. That workers were complaining in
the Gulf last week was making a question for global football. We might
want to be at least equally concerned with what we have learned from
the workers inside the matrix all this while.
We must ask what it meansboth in the private and in the public world
of listening and spying and analyzing and concludingthis thing that
we're now calling "privacy," in relation to the thing that we used to
call freedom.
But of course, in the end, all of this would not be worth talking
about here, much less your coming to listen to me talk here, unless we
were going to talk about what we are actually going to do. If the
problem is that we slept too long, then plainly Mr. Snowden did not
come but to wake us up.
We shall see that there are both legal and political forms of
resistance around the world that we must all engage in. And I shall
show next time as best I can the possibilities down which we may
choose to take ourselves in that regard. But we must also change the
way we communicate, so as to restore the balance between what they can
and what they can't do.
Here lies the secret of Mr. Snowden's enormous sacrifice and their
enormous anger. Because the center of what Mr. Snowden has done is to
tell us what armor still works. He has spent his life now for us, to
tell us what we still have time to do if want to restore to the
technology of our communications the morality of freedom.
He has been quite precise. He has been quite careful. He has been most
thorough. He understands his business. He has spied on injustice for
us and he has told us what we needed to know. Despite the efforts
continuing every instant all around us, in a world becoming a safe and
dreary prison for their enemies, he has told us what we require in
order to do the job and get it right. And if we have a responsibility
at all, then part of our responsibility is to learn, now, before
somebody concludes that learning should be prohibited.
Which never happens in a free society.
I wish we weren't here. I don't wish that I wasn't here more than I
wish you weren't here. I wish us all out of this war. Twelve yearsthe
longest war in history of this society, nowhere concluded, nowhere
near finishing, nowhere capable of being defined as done.
We went from listening to armies and embassies to listening to global
trade and now we are fastening spying on entire societies, with a
skill and energy that only a growing empire can still manage. We shall
talk about the world where a nation of 1.3 billion people gains a
Content Monitoring System in sixteen months, against the ordinary
suppositions of every Indian person who thinks, "they can't do that."
But, thanks to the new Bechtel, Booz Allen Hamiltonerstwhile employer
of one Edward J. Snowdenyes they can.
The proceduresmind you only the proceduresof totalitarianism are a
leading American export these days. I wish we weren't here. I wish
that everything we thought we did in the twentieth century we had
accomplished. I wish we had defeated totalitarianism. I wish we had
eliminated smallpox. I wish that we were growing the Net that we
deserve to have, in which every human brain could learn and every
human being could grow, nourished by the knowledge and the support of
all the others.
There may come a day. But if we have only one more river to cross
before we get to freedom, it's a deep one, and it runs fast the other
way. And those who want to bring us out are going to be called
traitorsthey are. And God forbid that they should lift their hands in
anger, or they will be slaughtered. And those who do it will feel they
have all the right on their side.
It is wrong to be right too soon.
It's wrong to be right too soon, but it is not too soon to be right
now. Because if we're not right now, then they will remember our
failure for fifteen centuries. And they will say of us, oppressed by
the weight of our corruption, and our fear of terrorist violence, that
we were ready to submit so long as we were assured that we possessed
our ancient freedoms. And as for everybody elseif not "Civis romanus
sum," then who are you?
Which is no way for us to be talking. Not now, not ever.
We have wandered so far into the dark that we have lost who we are.
Like many a tragic figure in history, Mr. Snowden went further out
into the dark in the hope that he could lead us back.
We had better do our best to learn from him what we can, as we watch
his light vanish into the darkness.

- Run internal attacks (using one part of protocol to attack itself in same run)
- Classic replay (no contemporaneous or repeated runs needed)
- Interleaving attacks (using concurrent runs of a protocol against
other runs of the same protocol)
provides a foundation for discussing replay attack prevention.

context of key agreement or transport privacy:
- time stamping messages
- sequence numbering messages
- type tagging messages
- identity tagging messages (reflection prevention)
- ensuring full information priciple when using hash functions
- generating session keys without mutual trust

Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia
By JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON - Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency
contractor, said in an extensive interview this month that he did not
take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to Russia when he fled there
in June, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get
access to them.
Mr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had
obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow,
and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to
Russia because it wouldn't serve the public interest," he said.
"What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of
the materials onward?" he added.
He also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from
China's spies because he was familiar with that nation's intelligence
abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese
operations and had taught a course on Chinese
"There's a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received
any documents," he said.
American intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the
files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence
services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had
not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was
publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to
explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to
them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously,
he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.
In a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr.
Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been
leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided
new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and
decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international
debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The
interview took place through encrypted online communications.
Mr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by
government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and
he is facing charges under the Espionage Act for leaking the N.S.A.
documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he
was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nation's best interests by
revealing information about the N.S.A.s surveillance dragnet and huge
collections of communications data, including that of Americans.
He argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a
badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort.
The secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater
danger than their disclosure," he said. He added that he had been more
concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.s reach
than he was about any specific surveillance operation.
So long as there's broad support amongst a people, it can be argued
there's a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally
wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision," he said.
However, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public
oversight, lack that legitimacy, and that's a problem. It also
represents a dangerous normalization of governing in the dark, where
decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.
Mr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong,
nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He
said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from
Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last
target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said,
adding that he had had access to every target, every active
operation mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. Full lists of
them, he said.
If that was compromised, he went on, N.S.A. would have set the
table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage
it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage
from the leaks. They havent said boo about it except we think,
maybe, have to assume from anonymous and former officials. Not
China is going dark. Not the Chinese military has shut us out.
An N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for
comment on Mr. Snowden's assertions.
Mr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed
gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in
the Geneva station of the C.I.A. His experiences there, Mr. Snowden
said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also
convincing him that working through the chain of command would only
lead to retribution.
He disputed an account in The New York Times last week reporting that
a derogatory comment placed in his personnel evaluation while he was
in Geneva was a result of suspicions that he was trying to break in to
classified files to which he was not authorized to have access. (The
C.I.A. later took issue with the description of why he had been
reprimanded.) Mr. Snowden said the comment was placed in his file by a
senior manager seeking to punish him for trying to warn the C.I.A.
about a computer vulnerability.
Mr. Snowden said that in 2008 and 2009, he was working in Geneva as a
telecommunications information systems officer, handling everything
from information technology and computer networks to maintenance of
the heating and air-conditioning systems. He began pushing for a
promotion, but got into what he termed a petty e-mail spat in which
he questioned a senior manager's judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text in a nonmalicious manner=94 to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowden's personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.=92s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowden's account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency theres a lot of dissent
 palpable with some, even. But he said that people were kept in line
through fear and a false image of patriotism, which he described as
obedience to authority.
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts would have been
buried forever, and he would have been discredited and ruined.=94 He
said that the system does not work, adding that you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector generals report on the N.S.A.s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a dirty word search, which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
"It was too highly classified to be where it was," he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, curiosity prevailed, he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. =93If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all, he said, secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. You cant read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have," he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias divorced from the decision-making
of publication, and that technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldn't be interfered with."
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

the recent releases[0] have shown this to be more complicated than expected.
in terms of sharing: other domestic agencies and some of the FVEY

in terms of breaking Tor:
the core Tor protocol and network is described repeatedly as difficult
to compromise. attacking the client, opportunistic de-anonymization,
selective denial of service, and mallory-in-the-middle attacks, all
appear extremely effective when they are pointed at Tor users of
interest. Tor's dependencies are failing in practice, rather than the
network or protocol itself.
Roger says the limited number of users targeted is reassuring, If
those documents actually represent what they can do, they are not as
big an adversary as I thought,[1]
the lack of widespread de-anonymization of Tor users is an interesting
situation.  i do not agree that they don't have the ability. other
sources clearly show their privileged positioning in the IP core for
active attacks as well as the global passive DPI tapping
infrastructure technically capable of linking large numbers of Tor
instead this implies that the other routes to identifying users,
particularly taking advantage of the endpoint and operational risks
above, are cheaper and more effective.
for less effort and resources locate them via side channel tricks,
infect them with spyware, and observe what they do
pre-encryption-and-pre-proxy directly.  it's clear to see why they've
been using this approach. [here is where i plug Qubes Tor VM, Tails,

ACM FORUM ON RISKS TO THE PUBLIC IN COMPUTERS AND RELATED SYSTEMS (comp.risks)
Peter G. Neumann, moderator, chmn ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy
  [Via Dave Farber's IP]
The press has lately been recirculating stories about the dollar damages of
the Snowden disclosures. The repudiation of key cryptography standards - the
ones that underly our electronic currency exchanges and clearinghouses, and
are present in an overwhelming number of products - may in the end cost
billions of dollars of damage. Some of the press would have us believe that
all of this is Snowden's fault. Better, some feel, to focus attention on the
messenger and protect the perpetrator. Or even if not better, easier. It
sells more papers to focus on a "David vs. Goliath" story than to examine
whether Goliath was actually a Philistine.
In compromising these cryptography standards, NSA's alleged goal was to read
the electronic communications of terrorists, arms dealers, and other savory
characters. In a world of open cryptography standards, the only way to do
that was to compromise *everybody*. That includes ordinary citizens,
businesses, governments (ours and others), armed forces command and control,
domestic and global financial systems, and so on. This goes beyond
privacy. Cryptography sits under all of our most essential electronic
communications. Focusing on Snowden has people asking "How safe are my
secrets from the NSA?" when a more pertinent question might be "Is my bank
still safe from the eastern block mafia and the terrorist of the month?"
Banks for the most part don't operate by storing dollar bills; they operate
electronically. Then there is the power delivery infrastructure, or... the
list goes on. *That* is what NSA compromised. And when you understand that,
it becomes clear that the damage to *us* was far worse than any cost to the
terrorists. In fact, the damage is proportional to your dependence on
electronic infrastructure.
That's bad. Because it means that people inside our government, at the
direction of government officials, sworn to protect and defend the
constitution and the country, actively conspired to undermine every segment
of the United States along with our key allies. While the run-of-the-mill
staff may not have understood this, the more senior people at NSA knew what
they were doing. They were certainly told by people on the outside often
enough. Frankly, I think some of them should hang. And I mean that
literally. These decisions by NSA weren't made by extremist muslims. They
were made by people from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (and elsewhere) right
here in America.
But there is something worse. In a certain sense, the NSA's primary mission
is the discovery of secrets. Being in the secret breaking business, one of
the things they know very well is that the best way to break a secret is to
get someone to tell you what it is. And there is *always* someone who will
tell you, either out of conviction or out of fear of compromise. There was
never a question whether the fact that NSA compromised every first world and
second world country would leak. The only questions were *who* would leak it
and *how soon*. It happened to be Snowden, but if not for Snowden it would
have been somebody else.
So setting aside the technical damage, there is the fact that the
U.S. Government is now known - and more importantly, believed - to have
compromised ourselves and our allies. We need to ask what the consequences
are of that. Here are some questions that suggest themselves:
1. Cryptography is clearly too important to entrust to the government. Who
   can we trust?
2. Fragmentation seems likely. Does that help or hinder us?
3. Do the issues differ for communications cryptography vs. long-term
   storage cryptography? Given that communications is recorded and stored
   forever, I suspect not.
4. Can our allies ever again trust an American-originated crypto system?
   Software system? Can we trust one from them?
5. Can our allies ever again afford to trust an American manufacturer of
   communications equipment, given that every one of the major players seems
   to have gotten in bed with NSA when pressured to do so by the
   U.S. Government?
6. What *other* compromised technologies have been promulgated through
   government-influenced standards and/or back room strong arm tactics?
One thing seems clear: we must now choose between the credibility of
American technology businesses and the continuation of export controls on
cryptography and computer security technology. The controls are ineffective
for their alleged purpose; there are too many ways to circumvent them. The
main use of these laws has been to allow government pressure to be brought
to bear on vendors who won't "play ball" with U.S. Government objectives. As
long as the big players in the U.S. computing and networking industries can
be be backdoored by their government (take that either way), only a fool
would buy from them. If the goal is to destroy the American technology
industry, this strategy is even better than software patents. As long as
those laws remain on the books, the American tech sector has a credibility
A second thing seems clear: we need to move to openly *developed* standards
for critical systems, not just open *standards*. And not just openly
developed standards, but standards whose "theory of operation" is explained
and critically examined by the public. No more unexplained magic tables of
numbers. We need fully open public review, and public reference
implementations as part of the standardization process.
A third thing seems clear: fixing the cryptography doesn't solve the
problem. Even with back doors, the best place to break crypto is at the
insecure end points. We need to develop information management methods
(e.g. "zero knowledge" methods, but also others) and software architectures
that let us limit the scope of damage when it occurs. The operating systems
- and consequently the applications - that we are using today simply weren't
designed for this. Fortunately, the hardware environment has converged
enough that we can do a lot better than we have in the past. There will
never be perfect security, but we can largely eliminate the exponential
advantage that is currently enjoyed by the attacker.

there is a significant difference between avoiding a cipher on principle,
 or association, or abundance of caution, or to avoid proving a negative,
and avoiding a cipher because it is "broken".
perhaps i am being pedantic, but the details matter!
the subterfuge and fail associated with Dual_EC_DRBG is a league apart
from the lack of transparency around P-192 to P-521 curves/constants
which in turn is entirely different from the meddling in cryptographic
protocols like IPsec and SSL/TLS which is in turn very different from
secret back|bugdoors in specific vendor cryptographic products and
implementations, and so forth.
this is complex; too often simplified to ingenuous "elliptic curves
are broken" or "NIST approved systems are backdoor'ed" or "AES and
SHA-2 are broken".
please don't propagate mis-information and mis-understanding via
careless terms and qualifiers; we have paid professionals in the
intelligence community for that!

it is simpler than that.  to signal integrity, and provide assurance,
it is common not just to avoid impropriety, but to avoid the
_appearance_ of impropriety.
this change, while not materially affecting security (the weakest link
in SilentCircle was never the crypto) succeeds in conveying the
message of integrity as paramount.
so yes, a marketing message, but a simple one. i have no problem with
this as long as they're not implying that AES or SHA-2 are broken in
some respect.

to be clear, this is true when running Tor and the browser on the same
computer, or having a Tor router / proxy appliance that you connect to
as transparent proxy.
in the latter case, you would still be best served by running a copy
of the Tor Browser in "Transparent Tor" mode[0], which delegates
routing through Tor to another service, while providing a browser
environment with all of the useful protections[1] to avoid this very
problem and many others.

Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia
By JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON  Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency
contractor, said in an extensive interview this month that he did not
take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to Russia when he fled there
in June, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get
access to them.
Mr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had
obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow,
and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to
Russia because it wouldnt serve the public interest, he said.
What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of
the materials onward? he added.
He also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from
Chinas spies because he was familiar with that nations intelligence
abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese
operations and had taught a course on Chinese
Theres a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received
any documents, he said.
American intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the
files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence
services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had
not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was
publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to
explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to
them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously,
he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.
In a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr.
Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been
leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided
new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and
decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international
debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The
interview took place through encrypted online communications.
Mr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by
government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and
he is facing charges under the Espionage Act for leaking the N.S.A.
documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he
was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nations best interests by
revealing information about the N.S.A.s surveillance dragnet and huge
collections of communications data, including that of Americans.
He argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a
badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort.
The secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater
danger than their disclosure, he said. He added that he had been more
concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.s reach
than he was about any specific surveillance operation.
So long as theres broad support amongst a people, it can be argued
theres a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally
wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision, he said.
However, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public
oversight, lack that legitimacy, and thats a problem. It also
represents a dangerous normalization of governing in the dark, where
decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.
Mr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong,
nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He
said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from
Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last
target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said,
adding that he had had access to every target, every active
operation mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. Full lists of
them, he said.
If that was compromised, he went on, N.S.A. would have set the
table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage
it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage
from the leaks. They havent said boo about it except we think,
maybe, have to assume from anonymous and former officials. Not
China is going dark. Not the Chinese military has shut us out. 
An N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for
comment on Mr. Snowdens assertions.
Mr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed
gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in
the Geneva station of the C.I.A. His experiences there, Mr. Snowden
said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also
convincing him that working through the chain of command would only
lead to retribution.
He disputed an account in The New York Times last week reporting that
a derogatory comment placed in his personnel evaluation while he was
in Geneva was a result of suspicions that he was trying to break in to
classified files to which he was not authorized to have access. (The
C.I.A. later took issue with the description of why he had been
reprimanded.) Mr. Snowden said the comment was placed in his file by a
senior manager seeking to punish him for trying to warn the C.I.A.
about a computer vulnerability.
Mr. Snowden said that in 2008 and 2009, he was working in Geneva as a
telecommunications information systems officer, handling everything
from information technology and computer networks to maintenance of
the heating and air-conditioning systems. He began pushing for a
promotion, but got into what he termed a petty e-mail spat in which
he questioned a senior managers judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text in a nonmalicious manner to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager  the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier  was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowdens personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowdens account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency theres a lot of dissent
 palpable with some, even. But he said that people were kept in line
through fear and a false image of patriotism, which he described as
obedience to authority.
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts would have been
buried forever, and he would have been discredited and ruined. He
said that the system does not work, adding that you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector generals report on the N.S.A.s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a dirty word search, which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
It was too highly classified to be where it was, he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, curiosity prevailed, he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all, he said, secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. You cant read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have, he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias divorced from the decision-making
of publication, and that technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldnt be interfered with.
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

some have suggested a rule  don't distribute updates automatically

that is delivered to the client via the server.
i have yet to see a definitive case of a US company forced to include
a backdoor in their software or forced to use their software update
channel to deliver a CALEA/intercept friendly version of code to the
targeted customer.  to date all of these requests appear to be off the
record rather than enforced via judicial motion.
this is a shame, since out of date software itself poses significant
risk, and is best resolved via automatic updates from the vendor.
i'll avoid repeating my "email is for public communication" rant ;)
my reading of this sequence of motions is that at least five different
keys were requested, which seems to imply _all_ SSL/TLS keys,
including those for HTTPS sessions.
e.g. they can request "pen register" information for web traffic!

this is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the LavaBit proceedings. See:
  in short if you have not designed your system to be amenable to
metadata tapping, particularly all the rich metadata requested by a
"pen register", they're going to demand the encryption keys to access
this metadata.

SSL private keys are demanded under the smallest of justifications,
which need not even show probable cause nor reasonable suspicion!!

July 16, 2013
TRANSCRIPT  OF  HEARING
BEFORE  THE  HONORABLE  CLAUDE  M.  HILTON
[ED: James Trump is the fed lawyer, Ladar Levinson the LavaBit operator.]
 THE  COURT:  So  as  I  understand  it,  my  initial  order ordered
nothing  but  that  the  pen  register  be  put  in  place.
MR .  TRUMP :  And  all  technical  assistance,  information, and
facilities  necessary  to  implement  the  pen  register.  And
 it's our  position  t hat  without  the  encryption  keys,  the  data
from  the  pen  register  will  be  meaningless.  So  to  facilitate
the actual  monitoring  required  by  the  pen  register,  the  FBI
also requires  the  encryption  keys .
THE  COURT:  Well,  that  could  be,  but  I  don't  know  that I
need  - - I  don ' t  know  that  I  need  to  reach  that  because
I've issued  a  search  warrant  for  that .
MR.  TRUMP :  Correct,  Your  Honor.  That  the  -- to  avoid
litigating  this  issue,  we  asked  the  Court  to  enter  the
seizure warrant.
THE  COURT :  Well,  what  I ' m  saying  is  if  he  agrees  that the
 pen  register  be  established,  and  that  the  only  thing  he
doesn't  want  to  do  in  connection  with  the  pen  register  is
to give  up  the  encryption  device  or  code
MR.  LEVISON :  I've  always  maintained  that .
THE  COURT :  -- so  we ' ve  got  no  issue  here .  You're ready  to
 do  that?
MR.  LEVISON :  I ' ve  been  ready  to  do  that  since  Agent Howard
 spoke  to  me  the  first  time .
THE  COURT:  All  right .  So  that  ends  our  --
MR .  TRUMP :  Well,  then  we  have  to  inquire  of Mr,  Levison
whether  he  ... Jill  produce  the  encryption  keys  pursuant to
the  search  warrant  that  Your  Honor  just  signed.
THE  COURT :  But  I  can't  deal  with  that  this  morning, can  I?
MR .  TRUMP :  Well ,  it ' s  the  same  issue .  You  could  ask
him,  Your  Honor .  We  can  serve  him  with  the  warrant  and  ask
 him if he' 5  going  to  comply  rather  than  - -
MR.  LEVISON :  Your  Honor I've  also  been  issued  a subpoena
demanding  those  same  keys,  which  I  brought  with  me  in the
event  that  we  would  have  to  address  that  subpoena .
THE  COURT :  I  don't  know,  Mr .  Trump .  I  don't  think  I want
to  get  involved  in  asking  him .  You  can  talk  with  him  and
see  whether  he ' s  going  to  produce  them  or  not  and  let  him
 tell you .  But  I  don ' t  think  I  ought  to  go  asking  what
he's  going  to do  and  what  he's  not  going  to  do  because  I
can ' t  take  any  action about  it  anyway . If he  does  not
comply  with  the  subpoena,  there  are remedies  for  that  one  way
 or  another .
MR .  TRUMP:  Well,  the  original  pen  register  order  was followed
 by  a  compulsion  order  from  Judge  Buchanan .  The compulsion
order  required  the  encr yption  keys  to  be  produced . So ,  yes,
 part  of  the  show  cause  order  is  to  require compliance  both
with  the  pen  register  order  and  the  compulsion order  issued
by  Judge  Buchanan . And  that order,  which  was  attached  to  the
show  cause order,  states,  "To  the  extent  any  information,
facilities,  or technical  assistance  are  under  the  control  of
Lavabit  are  needed to  provide  the  FBI  with  the  encrypted
data,  Lavabit  shall provide  such  information,  facilities,  or
technical  assistance forthwith ."
MR.  LEVISON :  I  would  object  to  that  statement .  I don't  know
 if I'm  wording  this  correctly,  but  what  was  in  that order  to
 compel  was  a  statement  that  was  incorrect . Agent  Howard
seemed  to  believe  that  I  had  the  ability to  encrypt  the
e-mail  content  stored  on  our  servers,  which  is not  the  case .
 I  only  have  the  keys  that  govern  communications into  and  out
 of  the  network ,  and  those  keys  are  used  to secure the
traffic  for  all  users,  not  just  the  user  in  question . So
the  statement  in  that  order  compelling  me  to  decrypt stuff
and  Agent  Howard  stating  that  I  have  the  ability  to  do that
is  technically false  or  incorrect.  There  was  never  an explicit
demand  that  I  turn  over  these  keys .
THE  COURT :  I  don't  know  what  bearing  that  would  have, would
it?  I  mean,  I  don't  have  a  problem  -- Judge  Buchanan issued
an  order  in  addition  to  mine,  and  I'm  not  sure  I  ought  to
be  enforcing  Judge  Buchanan's  order . July  order,  if  he  says
that  he  will  produce  or  allow  the installation  of  the  pen
register,  and  in  addition  I  have  issued a  search  warrant  for
the  codes  that  you  want,  which  I  did  this morning,  that's
been  entered,  it  seems  that  this  issue  is  over as  far  as
I'm  concerned  except  I  need  to  see  that  he  allows  the pen
register  and  complies  with  the  subpoena .
MR .  TRUMP :  Correct .
THE  COURT:  If  he  doesn't  comply  -- if  he  doesn't comply  with
the  subpoena,  then  that  has  -- I  have  to  address that.
MR .  TRUMP :  Right .
THE  COURT:  But  right  now  there's  nothing  for  me  to address
here  unless  he  is  not  telling  me  correctly  about  the  pen
register .
MR.  TRUMP:  Well ,  we  can  -- Your  Honor,  if we  can  talk to  Mr
.  Levison  for  five  minutes,  we  can  ask  him  whether  he  will
honor  the  warrant  that  you  just  issued .
MR.  LEVISON :  Before  we  do  that ,  can  I - -
THE  COURT :  Well,  what  can  I  do  about  it  if  he  doesn't, if
he  tells  you  he's  not  going  to?  You've  got  the  right  to  go
out  and  search  and  get  it .
MR .  TRUMP:  Well,  we  can't  get  the  information  without his
assistance .  He's  the  only  who  knows  and  has  possession  of it
.  We  can't  take  it from  him  involuntarily .
MR .  LEVISON :  If  I  may,  sir,  my  other
THE  COURT :  Wait  just  a  second . You're  trying  to  get  me
ahead .  You're  trying  to  get  me to  deal  with  a  contempt
before  there's  any  contempt ,  and  I  have a  problem  with  that.
MR .  TRUMP:  I'm  trying  to  avoid  contempt  altogether, Your  Honor .
THE  COURT:  I  know  you  are .  And  I'd  love  for  you-all to  get
 together  and  do  that.  I  don't  want  to  deal  with  it either.
But  I  don't  think  we  can  sit  around  and  agree  that there's
going  to  be  a  default  and  I  will  address  it before  it
MR .  TRUMP:  I'm  just  trying  to  figure  out  whether there's
going  to  be  a  default .  We'll  take  care  of  that,  Judge .
THE  COURT :  You  can .  I  think  the  way  we've  got  to  do this
- - and  I'll listen  to  you .  I'm  cutting  you  off,  I  know, but
 I'll listen  to  you  in  a  minute. The  way  we  have  to  do
this,  the  hearing  that's  before me  this  morning  on  this  issue
 of  the  pen  register,  that's  been resolved,  or  so  he's  told
me .  I  don't  know  whether  you  want  to continue  this  one  week
 and  see  if  he  complies  with  that,  which  I guess  would  be
prudent  to  do,  or  a  few  days  for  him  to  comply with  the
pen  register.  Then  we  Hill  wait  and  see  what  happens with
the  SUbpoena . Because  as  far  as  my  pen  register  order  is
concerned, he  says  he's  going  to  comply  with  it .  So  that
issue's  over  and done  with .  The  next  issue  will  be  ...
whether  or  not  he  complies with  the  subpoena .  And  I  don't
know  and  I  don't  want  to presume,  and  I  don't  want  him  to
represent  to  me  what  he  intends to  do  when  he  can  very  well
 go  home  and  decide  he's  going  to  do something  different. When
 that  warrant  is  served,  we'll  know  what  he's  going to  do .
I  think  we've  got  - - I  don't  see  another  way  to  do  it .
MR .  TRUMP :  That's  fine,  Your  Honor.  We  will  serve  the
warrant  on  him  as  soon  as  we  conclude  this  hearing,  and
we'll find  out  whether  he  will  provide  the  keys  or  not .

we can debate the ethics of remote drone kills separately, though
clearly i'm not an unbiased party.
however, this program fits the definition of "extrajudicial killing"
perfectly. having a secret judge issue a secret ruling that "you can
kill in secret without a trial, without due process, as long as
criteria X is met" does not change the nature of the act.
"An extrajudicial killing is the killing of a person by governmental
authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal
process. Extrajudicial punishments are by their nature unlawful, since
they bypass the due process of the legal jurisdiction in which they
occur. Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade
union, dissident, religious, and social figures and may be carried out
by the state government or other state authorities like the armed
forces and police."

risk from malicious peers.
in some few score years there will be zero coins rewarded for mining
blocks - the financial incentive, for what it is currently, merely a
transient part of the bootstrap.
is mining important? sure. but that does not mean a CPU or GPU can
contribute meaningfully to the current network. litecoin, as mentioned

and again, it is just as important to participate in the network, even

take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to Russia when he fled there
in June, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get
access to them.
Mr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had
obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow,
and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to
Russia because it wouldn't serve the public interest," he said.
"What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of
the materials onward?" he added.
He also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from
China's spies because he was familiar with that nation's intelligence
abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese
operations and had taught a course on Chinese
"There's a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received
any documents," he said.
American intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the
files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence
services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had
not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was
publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to
explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to
them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously,
he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.
In a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr.
Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been
leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided
new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and
decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international
debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The
interview took place through encrypted online communications.
Mr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by
government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and
he is facing charges under the Espionage Act for leaking the N.S.A.
documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he
was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nation's best interests by
revealing information about the N.S.A.s surveillance dragnet and huge
collections of communications data, including that of Americans.
He argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a
badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort.
The secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater
danger than their disclosure," he said. He added that he had been more
concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.s reach
than he was about any specific surveillance operation.
So long as there's broad support amongst a people, it can be argued
there's a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally
wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision," he said.
However, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public
oversight, lack that legitimacy, and that's a problem. It also
represents a dangerous normalization of governing in the dark, where
decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.
Mr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong,
nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He
said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from
Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last
target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said,
adding that he had had access to every target, every active
operation mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. Full lists of
them, he said.
If that was compromised, he went on, N.S.A. would have set the
table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage
it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage
from the leaks. They havent said boo about it except we think,
maybe, have to assume from anonymous and former officials. Not
China is going dark. Not the Chinese military has shut us out.
An N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for
comment on Mr. Snowden's assertions.
Mr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed
gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in
the Geneva station of the C.I.A. His experiences there, Mr. Snowden
said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also
convincing him that working through the chain of command would only
lead to retribution.
He disputed an account in The New York Times last week reporting that
a derogatory comment placed in his personnel evaluation while he was
in Geneva was a result of suspicions that he was trying to break in to
classified files to which he was not authorized to have access. (The
C.I.A. later took issue with the description of why he had been
reprimanded.) Mr. Snowden said the comment was placed in his file by a
senior manager seeking to punish him for trying to warn the C.I.A.
about a computer vulnerability.
Mr. Snowden said that in 2008 and 2009, he was working in Geneva as a
telecommunications information systems officer, handling everything
from information technology and computer networks to maintenance of
the heating and air-conditioning systems. He began pushing for a
promotion, but got into what he termed a petty e-mail spat in which
he questioned a senior manager's judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text in a nonmalicious manner=94 to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowden's personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.=92s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowden's account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency theres a lot of dissent
 palpable with some, even. But he said that people were kept in line
through fear and a false image of patriotism, which he described as
obedience to authority.
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts would have been
buried forever, and he would have been discredited and ruined.=94 He
said that the system does not work, adding that you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector generals report on the N.S.A.s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a dirty word search, which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
"It was too highly classified to be where it was," he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, curiosity prevailed, he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. =93If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all, he said, secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. You cant read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have," he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias divorced from the decision-making
of publication, and that technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldn't be interfered with."
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

to run in this mode your entropy daemon would read some bytes from the
kernel pool via /dev/random, mix those bytes with the collected
entropy, then feed back into the pool with the same entropy estimate.
in this way you're not "feeding" entropy from your HWRNG but instead
using it to improve the entropy collected via other sources (like high
res timers, etc.)
to be honest i've never considered running in this mode - the main
benefit of a HWRNG is the improvement in entropy generation and this
approach does not provide any such improvement.
this is what the "mixing" or "blinding" step of an entropy daemon
does: obscure the state of the HWRNG and compress the sampled entropy
via cryptographically secure digests or ciphers. (there are a few
different constructions for this, you should pursue the literature :)

do much more thorough userspace entropy daemon processing on the raw sources,
 mix to obscure state and compress for desired entropy density
adjustments (some consumers are picky)
  among other entropy pool and CSPRNG hygiene,
and you've solved your entropy contention problems!
determining the proper state of a hardware raw source like this is a
longer discussion, and sadly very implementation/architecture
yes, they work great. but they're not readily available, and as an
entropy source they're still low bit rate. you've got at best ~8Mhz of
sample with a low entropy density; effective consumer entropy

no argument here. some people like the ARM TrustZone entropy sources,
which are very accessible in recent gear spanning consumer space... i

Ron Wyden++
Ronald Bailey | Oct. 18, 2013 1:30 pm
Last week the Cato Institute put on a terrific conference about
unconstitutional domestic spying. The Cato conference took place after
a summer of alarming revelations of just how deep and extensive the
feds secret surveillance of our everyday communications had become.
The conference, held at the institutes downtown D.C. headquarters,
brought some of the most knowledgeable Internet luminaries together
with some of the fiercest fighters for Americans Fourth Amendment
Watchdog organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had sought for
years to expose the extent and depth of federal surveillance, but
their efforts were largely stymied by the very walls of secrecy they
were trying to breach. In the 2006 case Hepting v. AT&T, for example,
the EFF sued the giant telco for the privacy violations incurred by
allowing the National Security Agency (NSA) to wiretap and data-mine
all of the companys customers communications. To forestall this
case, Congress in 2008 passed the FISA Amendments Act, conferring
retroactive immunity on the telephone companies and government
agencies for engaging in warrantless wiretapping. Earlier this year,
the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the FISA Amendments Act
by the ACLU and other groups, on the grounds that they had no standing
to sue because they could not actually prove that the NSA was spying
on them. This is Catch-22 logic: The ACLU needs to sue the NSA to get
the evidence that the agency spied on it and its clients, but they
cant sue because they have no evidence that the agency spied on them.
The walls of surveillance secrecy were finally cracked by the June
revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden. Snowdens files
conclusively show that the federal government has been operating a
vast spying program that violates the Fourth Amendment rights of tens
of millions of ordinary Americans. To justify this surveillance, the
government offers tortured legal interpretations of Section 702 of the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Section 215 of the PATRIOT
Section 702 authorizes warrantless surveillance of the communications
of foreigners outside of the United States. As Snowdens documents
reveal, the NSA has interpreted Section 702 as a backdoor loophole
allowing the agency to retain and comb through the call data and
emails of Americans whose communications are about a terror suspect
or have been inadvertently intercepted by the NSAs PRISM monitoring
program. The even more egregious violations of our constitutional
rights, Snowden revealed, occurred under Section 215 of the PATRIOT
Act, which the NSA has used to justify the dragnet collection and
retention of the call metadata of essentially all Americans. (Metadata
includes the numbers called and the location, date, time, and duration
of each call.)
The first keynote at the Cato conference was delivered by Sen. Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), who cited the revelations of June numerous times.
Several speakers used such circumlocutions during the conference,
clearly as a way to avoid actually speaking the name of the man who
finally broke the news that our government has been unconstitutionally
spying on us for years. Despite his reticence with regard to Snowden,
Wyden has been at the lonely forefront of the fight to rein in
Americas growing surveillance state. It was Wyden who asked Director
of National Intelligence James Clapper in a March hearing whether the
agency collected any sort of data on hundreds of millions of
Americans. No, sir, lied Clapper. Not wittingly.
After Snowdens revelations proved that Clapper was a liar, Clapper
attempted to justify himself in a June television interview by
suggesting that collect doesnt mean the same thing to him that it
means to ordinary Americans. Collect, Clapper claimed, doesnt mean
intercepting and storing data about telephone calls; the data are only
collected when the agency goes searching through its vast databases
looking for specific calls. At the Cato conference, New York Times
national security reporter Charlie Savage pointed out that Congress
doesnt know that there is a secret lexicon at the NSA in which words
mean something else at the NSA. He recommended that people might want
to look up the Electronic Frontier Foundations helpful NSA glossary,
which shows how the agency reinterprets normal words in ways that
ordinary people would say amount to lies. Another speaker, Rep.
Justin Amash (R-Mich.), said that Clapper should step down and be
prosecuted for lying to Congress.
During his morning keynote, Wyden outlined the main provisions of a
new bill he introduced with Sens. Mark Udall (D-Utah), Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) two weeks earlier. The
bill would end the mass collection of Americans communication data,
close the backdoor search loophole under FISA Section 702, provide an
advocate to argue against government abuses before the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court, and enable citizens to be heard in
federal courts when they believe that the surveillance agencies have
violated their Fourth Amendment right to privacy. In addition,
telecommunications companies would be enabled to disclose more
information about their cooperation with government surveillance
Wyden warned that the agency heads and their enablers in the Congress,
such as Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), would be striking back against proposals for increased
transparency. Their objective is to fog up the surveillance debate,
he explained, and convince Congress and the public that the real
problem is not unconstitutional surveillance, the real problem is
sensationalistic reporting. Wyden is encouraged, however, by the
broader reaction to the revelations of June. Referring to the Amash
amendment, a July measure that sought to cut funding to the NSAs bulk
collection of Americans phone records, Wyden said, If youd told me
that you could get 200 votes on the floor of the House of
Representative, I would have said youre dreaming. The amendment
failed, but the vote was surprisingly close.
Of course, that vote was only possible because of Snowdens
disclosures. Yet in July, when Wyden was asked whether Snowden is a
hero or a villain, he replied that when there is an individual whos
been charged criminally and he has been charged with espionage, I
dont get into commenting beyond that. Wyden should comment, and his
comment should be: Thank you, Edward Snowden.
Next up at the conference was a panel of national security reporters
moderated by Catos Julian Sanchez. The panelists were Bart Gellman of
the Washington Post, Spencer Ackerman of The Guardian, Siobhan Gorman
of The Wall Street Journal, and Charlie Savage of The New York Times.
Gellman was the first speaker to say the word Snowden, noting that
the whistleblowers greatest fear was that the risks he took would be
all for nothing; that there would be no debate over the extent and
intrusiveness of domestic surveillance. In fact, Gellman declared,
Snowden succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.
Gellman also said that Clapper wasnt the only administration official
to lie to Congress. NSA chief Keith Alexander wasnt telling the truth
when he claimed a year ago that his agency does not hold data on U.S.
citizens at its gigantic new data facility in Bluffdale, Utah. And
the Justice Department had certainly been misleading, even if it
didnt technically lie, when it said the Section 215 authorities had
been used only 20 to 30 times to collect data. Yes, but those 20 to 30
times allowed the NSA to collect trillions of records.
Gorman added that the Snowden revelations had shaken the trees and
prompted other reporting that has forced other government disclosures
about various domestic spying efforts. For example, the NSA has tapped
the Internet backbone through secret agreements with nine major (but
unnamed) U.S. telecommunications companies. This has given the agency
the capacity to monitor 75 percent of all U.S. Internet
communications. Once it was revealed that the big telecommunications
companies were cooperating with the NSA spying program, Gellman noted,
they started agitating to be allowed to disclose more about what they
are being asked and ordered to do.
The luncheon keynote was delivered by Rep. Amash, who described how
spy agencies try to limit congressional access to information about
their activities, making meaningful oversight all but impossible.
Agencies speak in generalities and then engage in a game of 20
questions with legislators who seek deeper knowledge. They might, for
example, answer a query with No, our agency doesnt do that without
mentioning that another agency does.
Amash described one occasion in which he was seeking to review a
particular document and the agency promised to arrange for members of
Congress to do so. The agency did not send a message that the document
was available for scrutiny by emailing members offices directly;
instead it sent the notification through the more general and less
read Dear Colleague email system. Even then, the document was
available for review only between 9 a.m. and noon in a briefing room
on the day just before Congress was scheduled to leave for vacation.
Members who reviewed the document also had to sign a nondisclosure
agreement saying that they would not discuss it with other members who
had not seen it.
After lunch, the conference featured a panel of legal experts, many of
whom have tangled in court with the NSA and the Justice Department.
Georgetown law professor Laura Donohue argued that the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) was solely created to supervise
spying on foreign powers and their agents. Under statute, the FISC is
supposed to review and grant orders under Section 215 only when
agencies supply a statement of fact showing that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that tangible things sought are relevant to an
authorized investigation.
Donohue argues that the FISC and the NSA have now interpreted
relevant to include all data on all telephone calls, and possibly
other records, such as data on all emails, financial records, medical
records, and so forth. As such, Section 215 orders function as general
warrants allowing officials to rifle through the records of any
American without the need to show probable cause as delimited by the
Fourth Amendment.
The ACLUs Jameel Jaffer agreed that the NSAs dragnet collection of
phone records violates the relevance standard of Section 215. He also
argued that it violated Americans reasonable expectations of privacy
under the Fourth Amendment and, less obviously, our right of free
association under the First Amendment. If people think they are
watched by government agents, he explained, they may curtail innocuous
contacts with others out of fear that government functionaries will
misinterpret or abuse information about their relationships. David
Lieber, privacy counsel for Google, struck another First Amendment
note, expressing frustration over the governments prior restraint of
speech when it forbade his company (and others) from disclosing even
summary statistics on how much information on its customers the feds
were requiring it to turn over.
Paul Rosenzweig, a former deputy assistant for policy at the
Department of Homeland Security, is much more sanguine about NSA
domestic surveillance. He offered a very nice demonstration, produced
by journalist Kieran Healy based on David Hackett Fischers biography
of Paul Revere, showing how metadata on various club memberships would
have identified Paul Revere to the British authorities as the center
of terrorist network in late-18th-century Boston. That may sound
alarming to you, but to Rosenzweig the NSAs use of such relational
data-mining is relevant to an investigation.
The second afternoon panel focused on techniques to protect data from
federal surveillance. First, the good news: Jim Burrows of Silent
Circle, a new company offering various encryption services, observed
that TOR, the free open source software that protects users
anonymity, generally stands up to NSA snooping. Less happily, David
Dahl of SpiderOak, a company that offers encrypted file backup,
decried the recent revelations that the NSA had succeeded in
introducing subtle vulnerabilities by influencing the development of
encryption standards. Matt Blaze, an Internet security guru at the
University of Pennsylvania, observed that maintaining vulnerabilities
in computer code doesnt just make it easier for the NSA to spy; it
makes it easier for the Chinese, Russians, and Iranians to spy, and
for Internet criminals to steal data and cause other havoc.
Burrows discussed the case of Lavabit, an encrypted email service
apparently used by Snowden. The NSA ordered Ladar Levison, the owner
of the service, to hand over data that would enable the agency to spy
on his 350,000 customers. Levison instead shut down the service,
saying that he refused to become complicit in crimes against the
American people. Burrows noted that Silent Circle was also an
offering encrypted email service. Within 10 hours of learning what had
happened to Lavabit, Silent Circle shut down and purged its own
service without notice to subscribers. Burrows noted that had Silent
Circle informed its customers in advance the shutdown might have
become illegal. We knew for sure that someday some law enforcement
agency would order us to give them a backdoor, said Burrows.
Burrows noted that there is no email that is currently secure against
metadata collection, although users can securely encrypt the content
of their messages. The ACLUs Chris Soghoian added that the laws of
physics make it impossible to shield the location data emitted by
mobile phones. SpiderOaks Dahl speculated that some peer-to-peer
communications protocols with built-in cryptography might make secure
email possible.
The final panel considered what reforms are necessary to rein in
domestic surveillance. Cato Senior Fellow John Mueller demolished the
claim that the NSAs domestic spying has done much to protect
Americans against terrorism. NSA chief Alexander claimed in June that
mass telephone surveillance program had thwarted 54 terrorist plots.
In October, Alexander admitted in a Senate hearing that the telephone
dragnets effect was much more modest: It may have helped in one or
maybe two cases.
The Obama administration has doubled down on this program and doesnt
believe that it has done anything wrong, despaired Michelle
Richardson, legislative counsel for the ACLU. Center for Democracy and
Technology senior counsel Kevin Bankston remarked that it is insane
that Googles privacy counselor David Lieber had to dance around the
question of receiving requests from the NSA. People are free to say
they havent received such requests, but theyre not allowed to tell
anyone when they have.
The NSA has turned the Internet into a giant surveillance platform,
declared renowned tech guru and Harvard Berkman Center fellow Bruce
Schneier. Metadata collection that tells spies where a person went,
who he spoke to, what he bought, and what he saw equals surveillance.
When the president says, Its just metadata, he means, Dont
worry, youre all under surveillance all of the time. Schneier argued
that we need to make the Internet secure against all attackers. A
secure Internet is in everyones interests, said Schneier. We are
all better off if no one can do this kind of bulk surveillance.
Fundamentally, security is more important than surveillance. The
panel agreed that it is critical to pass legislation preventing the
government from mandating that companies build spy-friendly
insecurities into their systems.
The final keynote speaker, Rep. James Sensenbrenner (RWisc.),
outlined the contours of his Uniting and Strengthening America by
Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-Collection, and
Online Monitoring (USA FREEDOM) Act. His bill would limit the
collection of phone records to known terrorist suspects, force the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts to disclose surveillance
policies, establish a constitutional privacy advocate in that courts
proceedings, and permit companies to disclose NSA information
At the end of conference, the one person whose efforts made it
possible to for new Congressional reform efforts aimed at reining in
the surveillance state went largely unacknowledged. And so, again:
Thank you, Edward Snowden.

as an interesting aside, when i worked at a company providing
directory assistance to cell phone providers, there were some
individuals who would call DA just to be outbound dialed to the
desired number.
our call setup incurred a hairpin route for this outbound leg,
connecting the dialed party side through our switches, to provide
in-band services.
this had the convenient effect of masking the origin of a caller
through our network.  needless to say, we were strongly encouraged to
keep all CDR records for years, precisely because some many months
later a request would come in asking for the calling party information
associated with one of these outbound legs.
this is not even considering the "data analytics" reasons why carriers
keep these detail records indefinitely...

Keeper inner circle, and soldiers in the sycophant army that doltishly
parrot and hype everything these people say. The lesson is as follows:
1. Dont ever just dump your leaks on the internet.
2. Make sure your leaks are properly vetted and mediated by proper
mainstream journalists.
This lesson is often, perhaps even usually, stated as, or with, some
variation of the following:

Oh, Freedom - Part II
Good afternoon.
Since we were last here the press of the world has been full of
information concerning the practices of the US listeners, and
statements from Presidents, Premieres, Chancellors, and Senators on
the subject.
Our purpose this time being to consider the political meaning of Mr.
Snowden and the future he has brought us, we must begin by discarding
for immediate purposes pretty much everything said by the Presidents,
the Premieres, the Chancellors, and the Senators. It has been a
remarkable display of misdirection and misleading, and outright lying.
We'll come back to it, but it will not serve us at the outset.
It is indeed really what doesn't matterall this froth, that we've
been reading since we were last together, from the respondents. We
need to keep our eye on the thinking behind Mr. Snowden's
activitieswhich he has done much more to explain since we were last
togetherand we need to understand the message he has sent us. And so,
for that purpose, I come again before you.
What matters mostand what it has been the goal of the Presidents, the
Chancellors, the Premieres, and the Senators not to sayis how deeply
the whole of the human race has been ensnared in this process of
pervasive surveillance that destroys freedom.
The fastening of the procedures of totalitarianism on the human race
is the political subject about which Mr. Snowden has summoned us to an
urgent inquiry. And it is that inquiry which it has been the goal of
pretty much everybody responding on behalf of any Government or State
not just to ignore but to obscure.
We begin therefore where they are determined not to end, with the
question whether any form of democratic self-government, anywhere, is
consistent with the kind of massive, pervasive, surveillance into
which the Unites States government has led not only us but the world.
This should not actually be a complicated inquiry.
For almost everyone who lived through the 20th centuryat least its
middle halfthe idea that freedom was consistent with the procedures
of totalitarianism was self-evidently false.
Those who fought against it, those who sacrificed their lives to it
and had to begin again as displaced persons and refugees around the
world, and those who suffered under the harrow of it were all
perfectly clear that a society that listens to every telephone call,
spies on every meetings, keeps track of everybody's movements is
incompatible with a scheme of ordered liberty, as Justice Benjamin
Cardozo defined American constitutional freedom.
But at the beginning of the 21st century, what seemed clear and
absolutely unnecessary to inquire into in the 20th is now, apparently,
a question.
So we had better address it directly.
Many millions of people in the United States have in their family
tree, in their genetic material, in their understanding of the world,
visceral awareness of a system that tracked their ancestors'
movements, and for even the most trivial journey required they have a
pass. A system that gave some people the right to scrutinize every
communication of everybody else, that made almost every home subject
to intrusion and disruption at the whim of illegitimate power. For
those who have tasted the bitterness of slavery in their past, it
should not be necessary to explain why powershowever velvet the glove
in which they are contained may be, however invisible the system
within with they are embeddedthat keep track, that listen everywhere,
whose intrusion knows no boundaries, are the powers of masters over
We should therefore not need to inquire, carrying as we do our own
history closest, whether a system of power which listens everywhere,
which can go everywhere, which keeps track of everybody's thoughts,
feelings, and speech, is inconsistent with freedom. We know, because
we have lived on both sides of such a system. And we know its evil.
But let us forget what we have learned by bitter experience, what we
carry in our own breasts, let us forget it, let us put it aside, let
us be law professors, shall we, and political scientists:
For analytical purposes let us take this word "privacy," that we are
growing accustomed to using quite freely, and see what it really is.
Privacyas we use the word in our conversations now all around the
world, and particularly when we talk about the net really means three
The first is secrecy, which our ability to keep messages "private," so
that their content is known only to those who we intend to receive
The second is anonymity, which is our ability to keep our
messageseven when their content is openobscure as to who has
published them and who is receiving them. It is very important that
anonymity is an interest we can have in both our publishing and our
The third is autonomy, which is our ability to make our life decisions
free any force which has violated our secrecy or our anonymity.
These three are the principle components of the mixture that we call
"privacy". With respect to each, further consideration shows that it
is a precondition to the order that we call "democracy", "ordered
liberty", "self-government", to the particular scheme that we call in
the United States "constitutional freedom."
Without secrecy, democratic self-government is impossible. Because
people may not discuss public affairs with those they choose,
excluding those with whom they do not wish to converse. If you have
lived in a society where in every dorm room, every work place, every
public transport vehicle, there was an agent, whose job it was to
listen and inform, once you think about the consequences for political
conversation in that neighborhood, you need go no further. If you are
fortunate enough never to have had that experience, most of your
comrades around the world can enlighten you.
Anonymity is necessary for the conduct of democratic politics. The
United States Supreme Court took until 1995 to recognize it, but it
did, and to Justice Stevens we a owe clear statement of the importance
of anonymous political conversation at the core of the First
Amendment. The cases in which the Court has considered the anonymity
right are precisely cases about political communication, central cases
about the exercise of democracy. It is, as Justice Stevens noted in
McIntyre, not terribly surprising that our greatest artifact of divine
constitutional wisdoma set of political pamphlets penned by three
very slippery characters called Hamilton, Madison, and Jay that we
refer to as The Federalist Paperswere of course published under a
That autonomy is vitiated by the wholesale invasion of secrecy and
privacy, that free decision making is impossible in a society where
every move is monitored, those of you who have friends in North Korea
may enquire into directly, if you please. But equally, any
conversation with those who lived through 20th century
totalitarianisms or any contact with the realities of American slavery
will surely clear it up for you.
In other wordsthough it shouldn't be necessary to demonstrate, though
we ought to have taken the bitter experience of American history in
the 19th century and the history of the West in the 20th for
sufficient demonstrationfor those who really do like ignoring the
facts and working it out abstractly, with chalk, privacy is a
requirement of democratic self-government. The effort to fasten the
procedures of pervasive surveillance on human society is the
antithesis of liberty.
This is the conversation that all the "Don't listen to my mobile
phone!" has been not about for the last two weeks. If it were up to
power, the conversation would remain at that phony level forever.
So we are, at the momentthanks to Mr. Snowden, who has precipitated
what even his adversaries now like to call a "necessary
conversation"we are now in a necessary conversation with parties on
the other side who do not wish to explain exactly what they do. They
have advanced, and will advance, no convincing argument that what they
do is compatible with the morality of freedom, with US constitutional
law, or with the human rights of every person in the world. Indeed,
they will not offer any argument. They will certainly not offer a
defense. They will instead attempt, as much as possible, to change the
subject, and, wherever they cannot change the subject, to blame the
But what you have seen around the world in the last two weeks is the
evidence that this is extremely unlikely to work.
And so we need to consider the political environment created by what
has happened, before we can begin to address the more or less empty
rhetoric that has been assigned to the Presidents, the Chancellors,
and the Premieres.
"Why are they all operating in this way," you may ask nonetheless, "as
though everybody were on the same side?"
Here the history is very clear and remarkably available. One does not
need access to classified documents to seeincluding in records we
will be making public as part of our effort in "Snowden and the
Future" over the next two weekshow the military and strategic
thinkers in the United States adapted to the end of the Cold War by
planning pervasive surveillance of the world's societies.
In the early 1990's, in documents that are in no way secret, the US
strategic and military planners made clear in a range of forafrom the
think tanks, the Pentagon, in research reports and conference
proceedingsthat they foresaw, as indeed we now observe, a world in
which the United States had no significant state adversary, and would
be instead engaged in a series of "asymmetric conflicts." That was the
phrase, meaning "guerrilla wars."
In the course of that redefinition of the US threat assessments and
strategic posture after the end of the cold war, the American military
strategists and their intelligence community colleagues came to regard
American rights in communications privacy as the equivalent of
sanctuary for guerrillas.
The documents from 1992, 1993 are very clear in describing precisely
that relationship. It was understood that in future asymmetric
conflicts the adversariesthat means people, you understand, bad
people committed to bad activity but small groups of individuals
affiliated with and possessing the power of no statewould use
communications facilities that benefited from American civil liberties
as sanctuary, and that it would be necessary for the US military, the
listeners, to go after the "sanctuaries."
Of course, this was the position of military strategists and their
listener colleagues. It was not national policy. But it was an
important albeit relatively quiet part of the policy formation
discussion. There were, however, political adults in the room. And
while the United States government considered various efforts at
improving its ability to listen to encrypted communications in the
mid-90'sthe Clinton administration had the Clipper Chip initiative
for example. There were also significant efforts to ensure that
domestic law enforcement would not be disadvantaged by the movement to
digital communications. These lead in 1995 to the CALEA statute
mandating the availability of "wiretapping" technical facilities in
digital telephone systems that didn't natively offer thema compromise
which split the young Electronic Frontier Foundation into two camps,
one of which became CDT.
Although there were these steps taken to facilitate not only the work
of the domestic law enforcement agencies but also the listeners within
the United Statesthis we now know, as we see the evolution of the
FISA statute in the FISA court, secret judicature we couldn't see
beforestill and all there was a clear understanding. This idea of
denying "sanctuary" by breaching American civil liberties in US-based
communications was not part of the senior policy-making outlookit was
part of what one team constantly pushed for.
This they did after the first World Trade Center bombing, after the
Africa embassy bombings, after the Cole. The whole pervasive
surveillance system, not just the Patriot Act but all the pieces that
we now understand surrounded it in the secret world's understanding,
were constantly advocated for at the end of the 20th century, and as
constantly rebuffed.
And then, as we saw last time, at the opening of the 21st century a US
Administration which will go down in history infamous for its tendency
to think last and shoot first boughthook, line, and sinkerthe entire
"denying sanctuary," pervasive surveillance, "total information
awareness" scheme. Within a very short time after January 2002, mostly
in secret, they put it all together.
The consequences around the world were remarkably uncontroversial. By
and large, states approved or accepted. Some of this happened because
the United Stated government was even then using quite extraordinary
muscle around the worldafter September of 2001 you were either with
us or you were against us. But it also happened because so many other
governments had come to base their national security systems crucially
on cooperation with American listening. And after the declaration of
the new Global War on Terror, that became only more true.
By the time the present Administration had settled into office in the
United States, as one senior official with relevant responsibility
described it to me half-way through the first term, in our government
to government relationships about the Net, "all of us-the Chinese,
the Europeans, and Us," that was 'all of us' at the table, "we all
agree about one thing, about exfiltration." (This is the listeners'
word for spying: "exfiltration." They "exfiltrate" data off our
networks into theirwarehouses.) "We all agree," this official said,
"about exfiltration: everybody agrees that it can't be stopped and it
shouldn't be limited. We disagree about what kinds of intervention,"
that is, breaking things in the Net, "should be allowed."
The important point for present purposes in this one conversation
(which could be drawn just as well from many other unclassified
sources) was that senior US policy makers thought there was general
consensus around the world that everybody could listen to everybody's
societies; it could not be stopped it shouldn't be limited. The
Chinese agreed. The US agreed. The Europeans agreed, which really
meant of course that they were dependent on US listening and hadn't a
lot of power to object.
Nobody told the people of the world.
What was common understanding among the policy-making elitewho
governed among them still only about a third of the world's
populationwas that global civil society was a free fire zone for
everybody's listeners, and there wasn't anything to be said about
itparticularly not to all those people, who were supposed to not
This is the condition upon which the whistles started to blow all over
the field, as I said last time. Throughout the distressingly
situational ethics of this, a few peopleall of them in the English
speaking world, all of the, people who came from societies with strong
traditions of the rule of law, protection for whistle-blowers, some
form of civilian political control over domestic security
intelligencecourageous and indignant whistle-blowers began to speak
Mr. Snowden saw what happened to precedent whistle-blowers, and
behaved accordingly.
What had opened by the end of the first decade of the 21st century was
a gap between what the people of the world thought their rights were
and what their governments had given away in return for intelligence
useful only to thy have adopted a misleading metric; they think if a
program produces anything it is justified.
Because of course the very essence of democracy is that it is for the
people to judge what is justified with respect to invasions of their
entrenched and fortified rights.
And I think that Mr. Snowden meansas certainly I and my comrades
meanthat in the exercise of the democratic discretion to determine
whether we wish to fasten these procedures of totalitarianism on other
people in the world, that we should consider our values as extending
beyond our borders.
We meanand I think Mr Snowden means with usthat we should make those
decisions not in the narrow, selfish self-interest that is raison
d'etat, but with some heightened moral sense of what it is appropriate
for a beacon of liberty to humanity to do.
We will speak, of course, about American constitutional law and about
the importance of American legal phenomenarules, protections, rights,
dutieswith respect to all of this. But we should be clear that, when
we talk about the American constitutional tradition with respect to
freedom and slavery, we're talking about more than what is written in
the law books.
We face now a global system in which the States have, almost without
exception, agreed complicitiously to deliver over their people to a
form of pervasive spying which we know is incompatible with our own
liberty and with the liberty that we have frequently postured in the
world as bringing to the human race as a whole. We know this. As
individual citizens we are now aware. Mr. Snowden has made it
impossible for us to ignore this fact unless we bury our heads so deep
in the sand that we are likely to suffocate.
But we face two claimsyou meet them everywhere you turnwhich
summarize the politics against which we are working. One argument
says, "It's hopeless, privacy is gone, why struggle?" The other says,
"I'm not doing anything wrong, why should I care?"
And theseneither one of them a brilliant argument from a political
point of viewthese are actually the most significant forms of
opposition that we face in doing what we know we ought to do.
In the first place, the premise of my being here before you is that it
is far from hopeless. Mr. Snowden has described to us, as I told you
last time, what armor still works. Mr. Snowden's purpose was to
explain to us how to distinguish between those forms of network
communication that are hopelessly corrupted and no longer usable,
those that are endangered by a continuing assault on the part of an
agency gone rogue, and those which even with their vast power, all
their wealth, and all their misplaced ambition, conscientious, and
effort, they still cannot break.
Hopelessness is merely what you are supposed to get, not what you have to have.
And so far as the other argument is concerned, we owe it to ourselves
to be quite clear in response. My own personal position I recommend to
my comrades around the world: If we are not doing anything wrong. then
we have a right to resist.
If we are not doing anything wrong, then we have a right to do
everything we can to maintain the traditional balance between us and
power that is listening. We have a right to be obscure. We have a
right to mumble. We have a right to speak languages they do not get.
We have a right to meet when and where and how we please so as to
evade the paddy rollers.
We have an American constitutional tradition against general warrants.
It was formed in the 18th century for good reason. It puts the limit
of the State's ability to search and seize at what you can convince a
neutral magistrate, in a particular situationabout one place, one
time, one thingis a reasonable use of governmental power.
That principle was dear to the First Congress which put it in the Bill
of Rights, because it was dear to British North Americans, because in
the course of the 18th centuAnd so the constitutional tradition we
should be defending, now, as Americans, is a tradition which extends
far beyond whatever boundary the Fourth Amendment has in space, place,
or time. We should be defending not merely a right to be free from the
oppressive attentions of the national government, not merely fighting
for something embodied in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment
after 1961, because of a trunk of smut left behind by a departing
lodger in Mrs. Mapp's boarding house in Ohio. We should be rather be
fighting against the procedures of totalitarianism because slavery is
wrong; because fastening it on the human race is wrong; because
providing the energy, the money, the technology, the system for
subduing everybody's privacy around the worldfor destroying sanctuary
in American freedom of speechis wrong.
And if we're going to exercise our democratic rights in the United
States as Mr. Snowden wishes us to doand has given us the most
valuable thing that democratic self-governing people can have, namely
information about what is going onif we are to do all that, then we
should have clear in our mind the political ideas upon which we ought
to be acting. They are not parochial, or national, or found in the
U.S. Reports alone.
A nation conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal, enslaved millions of people. It washed away
that sin in a terrible war We should learn from that, as we are called
upon now to do.
The politics that we have as Americans are slightly more complicated,
but they are fundamentally the same as the lines upon which our
colleagues and comrades around the world must also move. Everywhere
citizens must demand two things of their governments:
In the first place, you have a responsibility, a duty, to protect our
rights by guarding us against the spying of outsiders. Every
government has that responsibility. Every government has the
responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens to be free from
the intrusive spying of outsiders. No government can pretend to
sovereignty and responsibility with respect to its citizens unless it
makes every effort within its power and its means to ensure that
In the second place, every government around the world must subject
its domestic listening to the rule of law.
Now this is the tragedy, where the overwhelming arrogance of the
listeners has left the American government. The government of the
United States could have held up its head until the day before
yesterday and said that its listeners, unlike all the other listeners
in the world, were subject to the rule of law. It would have been an
accurate boast.
To be sure the rule of law even in the last generation was somewhat
corrupted by secret judicature, and a court appointed by a single
decision maker, and so on and so on. But the truth is that American
listening was subject to the rule of law as no one else's was in the
world or is now.
For nothing, history will record, they threw that away. For nothing
they threw that away.
But it is true everywherewhether we are here, or we are in China or
we are in Germany, or we are in Spain, or wherever we arethose two
basic principles of our politics are uniformly applicable: our
government must defend us against pervasive spying by outsiders, and
our government must subject listening to the rule of law at home.
To the citizens of the United States a greater responsibility is given
because we must act to subject our government to control in the
listening it is doing to hundreds of millions and ultimately billions
of people around the world. Ours is the government that is projecting
immensities of power into the destruction in the world's societies and
ours is the government which must be put under democratic control with
respect to that listening. It is our principles in favorem libertatis
which must be the dominant principles in that story.
Freedom has been hunted round the glob war, a Net which no longer uses
surveillance to destroy the privacy that founds democracy.
This is a matter of international public law. In the end this is about
something like prohibiting chemical weapons, or land mines. A matter
of disarmament treaties. A matter of peace enforcement.
Pervasive surveillance of other peoples' societies is wrong and we
must not do it. Our politics, everywhere around the world, are going
to have to be based in the restoration of the morality of freedom,
which it is the job of democracy to do.
The difficulty is that we have not only our good and patriotic fellow
citizens to deal with, for whom an election is a sufficient remedy,
but we have also an immense structure of private surveillance that has
come into existence. a structure which has every right to exist in a
free market but which is now creating ecological disaster from which
governments alone have benefited. From which people have been rendered
far less well off than they think they are, and than they should have
You don't need today's Washington Post on the subject of the massive
interception of information flowing in and out of Google and Yahooand
soon it will be Facebook and Microsoft's cloudas we begin to
understand what government is doing with "the cloud." You don't need
any of that to understand that at the end of the day, we have to
assess not only what the States have done, but also what unregulated
enterprise has done, to the ecology of privacy
We have to consider not only, therefore, what our politics are with
respect to the States but also with respect to the enterprises. This
is the subject of our talk next time.
But for now we are left attending a puppet show in which the people
who are the legitimate objects of international surveillancenamely
politicians, heads of state, military officers, and diplomatsare
yelling and screaming about how they should not be listened to. As
though they were us and had a right to be left alone.
And that, of course, is what they want. They want to confuse us. They
want us to think that they are usthat they're not the people who
allowed this to happen, who cheered it on, who went into to business
with it.
The literature of our time has not been deceptive about this. If one
reads John le Carre's views about the security industry in Germany
under the Global War on Terror (he, as you recall, had his actual
experiences as an intelligence officer on behalf of the British
government in Germany), if you look at what A Most Wanted Man says
about the nature of the cooperation between the Germans and the
Americans, and its effect on freedom, you will discover that after all
everybody really did knowexcept you.
The purpose of secrecy was to keep you in the dark. The purpose of
secrecy was not to prevent the States from knowing what they were
doing: their left hands and their right hands knew perfectly well what
they were up to.
We're going to have to cope with the problems their deceptions
created. Because among the things that our listeners have destroyed is
the Internet freedom policy of the United States government. They had
a good game that they were playing both sides of. But now we have
comrades and colleagues around the worldworking for the freedom of
the Net in dangerous societieswho have depended upon material support
and assistance from the United States government, and who now have
every reason to be worried and to be frightened.
What if the underground railroad had been constantly under efforts of
penetration by the United States government on behalf of slavery?
What if every book for the last five hundred years had been reporting
its readers at headquarters?
People talk about this as though it were a matter of the publicity of
what we publish rather than the destruction of the anonymity of what
we read. We will have to look next time very closely at what
commercial surveillance really does and how it really does it in order
to understand what our politics have to be. Because there, as here,
deception, misdirectionwaving the handkerchief over here so you do
not see what the other hand is doingis the whole secret to how it
The bad news for the people of the world is you were lied to
thoroughly by everybody for nearly twenty years. The good news is that
Mr. Snowden has told you the truth.
But if we really believe that the truth will set us free, we had
better do it now.

"Keeping Secrets: Pierre Omidyar, Glenn Greenwald and the
privatization of Snowdens leaks"
 - BY MARK AMES, NOVEMBER 27, 2013
Who owns the NSA secrets leaked by Edward Snowden to reporters Glenn
Greenwald and Laura Poitras?
Given that eBay founder Pierre Omidyar just invested a quarter of a
billion dollars to
personally hire Greenwald and Poitras for his new for-profit media
venture, its a question worth asking.
Its especially worth asking since it became clear that Greenwald and
Poitras are now the only two people with full access to the complete
cache of NSA files, which are said to number anywhere from 50,000 to
as many as 200,000 files. Thats right: Snowden doesnt have the files
any more, the Guardian doesnt have them, the Washington Post doesnt
have them just Glenn and Laura at the for-profit journalism company
created by the founder of eBay.
Edward Snowden has popularly been compared to major whistleblowers
such as Daniel Ellsberg,Chelsea Manning and Jeffrey Wigand. However,
there is an important difference in the Snowden files that has so far
gone largely unnoticed. Whistleblowing has traditionally served the
public interest. In this case, it is about to serve the interests of a
billionaire starting a for-profit media business venture. This is
truly unprecedented. Never before has such a vast trove of public
secrets been sold wholesale to a single billionaire as the foundation
of a for-profit company.
Think about other famous leakers: Daniel Ellsberg neither monetized
nor monopolized the Pentagon Papers. Instead, he leaked them to well
over a dozen different newspapers and media outlets such as the New
York Times and Washington Post, and to a handful of sitting senators 
one of whom, Mike Gravel, read over 4,000 of the 7,000 pages into the
Congressional record before collapsing from exhaustion. The Papers
were published in book form by a small nonprofit run by the Unitarian
Church, Beacon House Press.
Chelsea Manning, responsible for the largest mass leaks of government
secrets ever, leaked everything to WikiLeaks, a nonprofit venture that
has largely struggled to make ends meet in its seven years of
existence. Julian Assange, for all of his flaws, cannot be accused of
crudely enriching himself from his privileged access to Mannings
leaks; instead, he shared his entire trove with a number of
established media outlets including the Guardian, New York Times, Le
Monde and El Pais. Today, Chelsea Manning is serving a 35-year
sentence in a military prison, while the Private Manning Support
Network constantly struggles to raise funds from donations; Assange
has spent the last year and a half inside Ecuadors embassy in London,
also struggling to raise funds to run the WikiLeaks operation.
A similar story emerges in the biggest private sector analogy  the
tobacco industry leaks by whistleblowers Merrell Williams and Jeffrey
Wigand. After suffering lawsuits, harassment and attempts to destroy
their livelihoods, both eventually won awards as part of the massive
multibillion dollar settlements  but the millions of confidential
tobacco documents now belong to the public, maintained by a nonprofit,
the American Legacy Project, whose purpose is to help scholars and
reporters and scientists fight tobacco propaganda and power. Every
year, over 400,000 Americans die from tobacco-related illnesses.
The point is this: In the most successful whistleblower cases, the
public has sided with the selfless whistleblower against the power- or
profit-driven entity whose secrets were leaked. The Snowden case
represents a new twist to the heroic whistleblower story arc: After
successfully convincing a large part of the public and the American
Establishment that Snowdens leaks serve a higher public interest,
Greenwald promptly sold those secrets to a billionaire.
He justified this purely on grounds of self-interest, calling
Omidyars offer a once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity.
Speaking to the Washington Post, Greenwald used crude careerist
terminology to justify his decision to privatize the Snowden secrets:
It would be impossible for any journalist, let alone me, to decline
this opportunity.
Let alone me.
News about Greenwald-Poitras decision to privatize the NSA cache came
just days after the New York Times reported on Greenwalds
negotiations with major movie studios to sell a Snowden film. This
past summer, Greenwald sold a book to Metropolitan Books for a
reportedly hefty sum, promising that some of the most sensational
revelations from Snowdens leaks would be saved for the book.
Indeed what makes the NSA secrets so valuable to Greenwald and Poitras
is that the two of them have exclusive access to the entire cache.
Essentially they have a monopoly over secrets that belong to the
public. For a time, it was assumed that Snowden had kept copies of the
leaked documents, possibly on a number of laptops he was carting
around the world. Greenwald and Poitras were simply conduits between
Snowdens cache and the public. In late August, Greenwald disclosed
for the first time in a statement to BuzzFeed:
Only Laura and I have access to the full set of documents which
Snowden provided to journalists.
Later, from his hideout in Russia, Snowden released a statement
claiming he had left all the NSA files behind in Hong Kong for
Greenwald and Poitras to take. A third Guardian journalist in Hong
Kong at the time, Ewen MacAskill, confirmed to me on Twitter that only
Greenwald and Poitras took with them the full cache. Even the Guardian
was not allowed access to the motherlode.
Clearly, in a story as sensational and global and alluring as
Snowdens Secrets, exclusive access equals value. And for the first
time in whistleblower history, that value has been extracted in full
through privatization.
It is one thing for Greenwald to maintain that exclusivity  or
monopoly  while working with the Guardian, a nonprofit with
institutional experience in investigative journalism. It is quite
another for him to sell them to a guy with a history of putting
profits before public interest. As Yasha Levine and I wrote at
NSFWCORP, Omidyar invested in a third-world micro-loans company whose
savage bullying of debtors resulted in mass suicides. Rather than
acknowledge this tragedy, Omidyar Network simply deleted reference to
the company from his website when the shit hit the fan.
This  this?  is the guy were supposed to trust with the as-yet
unpublished NSA files? Hes the one were relying on to reveal any
dark secrets about the tech industrys collusion with the NSA? Lets
hope theres nothing in there about eBay. Whoops! Deleted!
Since we first raised our concerns, Yasha and I have been swamped with
responses from Greenwalds followers. The weird thing is, not all of
those responses have been negative: even Wikileaks Wikileaks! 
responded that, We have not [fallen out with Greenwald] but is seriously compromised by Paypals attacks on our organisation and
Greenwalds leftist and anarchist fans have always had an almost
cult-like faith in his judgment, seeing him as little less than a
digital-age Noam Chomsky. But now theyre reeling from cognitive
dissonance, trying to understand why their hero would privatize the
most important secrets of our generation to a billionaire
free-marketeer like Omidyar, whose millions have, in some cases,
brought market-based misery into some of the poorest and most
desperate corners of the planet.
A Greenwald-Omidyar partnership is as hard to swallow as if Chomsky
proudly announced a new major venture with Sheldon Adelson, on grounds
that its a once-in-a-career dream academic opportunity.
WikiLeaks concern about Omidyar can be traced back to PayPals
decision in December 2010 to blockade users from sending money to
WikiLeaks. PayPal (founded by Pando investor, Peter Thiel  more on
that below) is owned by eBay, where Omidyar has served as the chairman
of the board since 2002. Before the blockade, PayPal was the principal
medium for WikiLeaks donations, according to the Washington Post.
More troubling for fans is that Greenwald has repeatedly provided
cover for Omidyar, claiming that he had nothing to do with [the
blockade] despite his board status. Whether or not eBays chairman
really was ignorant of his companys most controversial decision in
years, theres no denying that Omidyar is also eBays largest
shareholder. At nearly 10%, his stake is worth billions and is more
than twice as large as that of the next largest shareholder.
By Greenwalds reasoning, even though Omidyar is the founder, largest
shareholder, and chairman of the body responsible for eBay/PayPal
management oversight, he had nothing to do with its policy towards
Wikileaks. Zero. None. He was as helpless as you, me, Batkid, or
Grumpy Cat.
Fortunately, as the single investor, founder and CEO of NewCo,
Omidyars self-professed helplessness at eBay doesnt extend to his
new journalistic venture. With that level of autonomy, no one  not
even Glenn Greenwald, who has admitted that Omidyars money is
irresistibly persuasive  can tell him which secrets to publish on his
new site, and which should remain hidden forever.
We can all rest easy in our beds, then, knowing that Omidyar is in
charge of our secrets. Information of national importance, such as

Robbing Peter to Pay Paul (and Mark). An important footnote about
Peter Thiel and Pando, by Paul Carr
When NSFWCORPs acquisition by Pando was announced, Greenwald raced to
Twitter to accuse us of hypocrisy because Peter Thiel (another
billionaire whose previous business dealings could fill a book, and
who sold PayPal to eBay in the first place) once invested $200,000 in
PandoDaily, through his Founders Fund.
Thats absolutely true. Founders Funds investment is disclosed here
on Pandos main about page, along with the names of the other
investors who collectively invested the remaining $2.8m raised by
The difference between us selling our company to a media outlet that
once received a minority investment from Founders Fund and Greenwald
being personally hired by Omidyar should be obvious to anyone with a
brain. But at the risk that category excludes Glenns most ardent
supporters, were happy to spell out the difference (apart from the
monetary difference of $249,800,000 between Thiels $200k and
Omidyars $250 million, of course):
Peter Thiel has no involvement with the running of Pando. Zero. He
doesnt make hiring or firing or any other kind of decisions (nor do
any other investors), Founders Fund isnt Pandos only (or even
closest largest) investor and no one from Founders Fund has a board
seat, voting rights or any other input in business or editorial
policy. In other words, Thiel has less ability to dictate editorial
policy here, in fact, than the guy who cleans the coffee cups (at
least that guy has a key to the office).
Pierre Omidyar is personally hiring the journalists for his new
project, starting with Greenwald himself. He is the ventures sole
backer. But, you know what? All of that would still be OK if Greenwald
would make a simple, unequivocal, public pledge: to cover any bad
behavior by Pierre Omidyar in the same way that he would cover someone
who wasnt backing him with millions of dollars.
Should be a simple thing to promise, right?
Heres our absolute, unequivocal pledge: we will cover Peter Thiel and
Pandos other investors just as fiercely as we cover Pierre Omidyar or
anyone else. In fact, its likely due to proximity that we will cover
Pandos investors even more fiercely. Thats how we always worked at
NSFWCORP  and its how well work here. Our past coverage of Thiel
can be found all over the web, including here, hereand even right here
on Pando. Or see how weve covered NSFWCORP/Pando investors
CrunchFundand Vegas Tech Fund.
When we asked Glenn to make that same pledge about his single
investor, in light of our coverage of Omidyar, he responded simply: I
cant speak for Omidyar Network, adding he had no idea about
Omidyars involvement in micro loans.

@_subject: Fwd: the new 2014 Add-Only Sets 
(This is a copy of
 .)
Here's my rendition of our discussion of add-only sets at the
Tahoe-LAFS Summit today. (As usual, I altered and embellished this
story significantly while writing it down, and people who were present
to witness the original discussion are invited to chime in.)
An add-only cap doesn't have to also be a write-only cap. It might be
good for some use cases that you can give someone a cap that lets them
read the whole set, and add elements into the set, without letting
them remove elements or change previously-added elements. It might be
good in some other use cases to have an "add-only&write-only" cap,
which allows you to add elements into the set but doesn't let you read
elements of the set, nor remove nor change previously-added elements.
We agreed to focus on the former case for now, because it is easier to
design and implement a solution to it. (See  for discussion of
write-only caps.)
We agreed to forget about erasure-coding, which makes an
already-confusing problem (how to implement add-only sets without
allowing a few malicious servers, adders, or set-repairers to perform
rollback attack or selection attack), into a very-confusing problem
that exceeded my brain's ability to grapple with it.
So, for now, assume that add-only sets don't use erasure-coding at all.
Now, the basic design we came up with is like this. I'll explain it in
multiple passes of successive refinement of the design.
FIRST PASS: DESIGN "0"
An authorized adder (someone who holds an add-cap) can generate
"elements", which are bytestrings that can be added into the set. (I
mispronounced "elements" as "elephants" at one point, and from that
point forward the design was expressed in terms of a circus act
involving elephants.)
Elephants have an identity as well as a value (bytestring), so:
    aos = DistributedSecureAddOnlySet()
    aos.add_elephant(b"\xFF"*100)
    aos.add_elephant(b"\xFF"*100)
results in aos containing two elephants, not one, even though each
elephant has the same value (the bytestring with one hundred 0xFF
bytes in it).
aos.add_elephant() generates a random 256-bit nonce to make this
elephant different from any other elephant with the same value. I call
this "putting a tag on the elephant's ear"  a "tagged elephant" is a
value plus a nonce. Even if two elephants are identical twins, they
can be distinguished by the unique nonce written on their ear-tags.
aos.add_elephant() then puts a digital signature on the
tagged-elephant (using the add-only-cap, which contains an Ed25519
private key), and sends a copy of the tagged-elephant to every one of
N different servers. Putting a digital signature on a tagged-elephant
is called "wrapping a net around it".
A reader downloads all the tagged-elephants from all the servers,
checks all the signatures, takes the union of the results, and returns
the resulting set of elephants.
Design "A" relies on at least one of the servers that you reach to
save you from rollback or selection attacks. Such a server does this
by knowing, and honestly serving up to you, a fresh and complete set
of tagged-elephants. Rollback is serving you a version of the set
that existed at some previous time, so the honest server giving you a
copy of the most recent set protects you from rollback attack.
Selection is omitting some elephants from the set, so the honest
server giving you a complete copy of the set protects you from
selection attack.
SECOND PASS: DESIGN "1"
We can extend Design "0" to make it harder for malicious servers to
perform selection attacks on readers, even when the reader doesn't
reach an honest server who has a complete copy of the most recent set.
The unnecessary vulnerability in Design "0" is that each
tagged-elephant is signed independently of the other tagged-elephants,
so malicious servers can deliver some tagged-elephants to a reader and
withhold other tagged-elephants, and the reader will accept the
resulting set, thus falling for a selection attack. To reduce this
vulnerability, adders will sign all of the current tagged-elephants
along with their new tagged-elephant with a single signature. More
precisely, let the "identity" of a tagged-elephant be the secure hash
of the tagged-elephant (i.e. the secure hash of the nonce concatenated
with the value). The signature on a new tagged-elephant covers the
identity of that tagged-elephant, concatenated with the identities of
all extant tagged-elephants, under a single signature. In circus
terms, you add the new tagged-elephant into a pile of tagged-elephants
and throw a net over the entire pile, including the new
Now, malicious servers can't omit any of the older tagged-elephants
without also omitting the new tagged-elephant. Readers will not accept
the new tagged-elephant unless they also have a copy of all of the
other tagged-elephants that were signed with the same signature. This
limits the servers's options for selection attacks.
THIRD PASS: DESIGN "2"
We can refine Design "1" to make it cleaner and more CPU-efficient and
network-efficient. This will also lay the groundwork for an efficient
network protocol.
The unnecessary "dirtiness" in Design "1" is that the digital
signatures on older tagged-elephants become extraneous once you add a
new digital signature. We have a mass of tagged-elephants, we throw a
net over the whole mass, then later when we add a new tagged-elephant
to the pile, we throw a new net on top of the new (slightly larger)
pile. Now the underlying net has become redundant: once you've
verified the signature of the outermost net, there is no need to check
the signature of the inner net. In fact, if one implementation checks
the signature of the inner net and another implementation does not
check it, then a malicious adder colluding with a malicious server
could cause the implementations to differ in their results, by putting
an invalid net (an invalid signature) topped by a new tagged-elephant
with a valid net. (Daira was the one who noticed that issue.)
To make this cleaner and more efficient, we will never put a net
around a net, and instead we'll keep each tagged-elephant in a box.
When you want to add a new tagged-elephant to a set, you rip off and
throw away any extant nets, then you put the new tagged-elephant in a
box which is nailed on top of the previous topmost box. Then you wrap
a net around the new topmost box. "Nailing" box Y on top of box X
means taking the secure hash of box X and appending that to box Y
(before signing box Y). A "box" is a tagged-elephant concatenated with
any number of "nails", each of which is the secure hash of a previous
(Note that you can sometimes have two or more boxes precariously
perched at the top of a stack, when two adders have simultaneously
added a box before each saw the other's new box. That's okay  the
next time an adder adds a box on top of this stack, he'll nail his new
box to each of the previous topmost boxes.)
Boxes are a lot more CPU-efficient than nets, and more importantly
nobody (neither readers, adders, nor servers) needs to revisit a
lower-down box in order to add a new top-most box. Once you nail box Y
on top of box X, then you can later add box Z just by taking the hash
of box Y, without revisiting box X.
Note that we need two different secure hashes here: one is the
identity of a tagged-elephant, which is the secure hash of: the nonce
concatenated with the value. The other is the hash of the box, which
is the secure hash of: the identity of a tagged-elephant concatenated
with the hashes of any previous boxes. We need the identity of a
tagged-elephant for finding out whether a certain tagged-elephant
already exists in a stack (regardless of what position it occupies
within that stack), and we need the hash of the box for efficiently
verifying that all the tagged-elephants in a stack were approved by an
authorized adder.
This also leads to the efficient network protocol: an adder can
remember (cache) the Directed Acyclic Graph of boxes which a given
server previously told the adder about. When the adder wants to add a
new tagged-elephant or a set of new tagged-elephants to that server,
he can send just the boxes which would be new to that server, assuming
that the server hasn't learned anything new since the last time they
talked. Readers can do likewise, remembering what each server
previously told them about, and asking the server to just tell them
about things that are not already covered the topmost box(es) that the
reader already knows about.
Okay, that's it! I think Design "2" is a good one. It has good
security against rollback or selection attacks by malicious servers
(assuming some kind of whitelisting of servers! Which is ticket and is not yet implemented.) And, it doesn't go too far over the top
in terms of complexity; it seems more intuitive to me than (my vague
memories of) previous attempts to design add-only sets for LAFS.
(By the way, there are a few other possible ways to strengthen
defenses against rollback attack, which we've previously considered in
the context of mutable files, but they probably also apply to add-only
I'm excited about this design being feasible, because I think add-only
sets could be a critical building block in valuable use-cases such as
secure logging, secure email, secure backup, and more.
P.S. Thanks to Isis and Mike for showing up today and, when asked what
Tahoe-LAFS improvements they were interested in, suggesting add-only

Inside TAO
Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit
By SPIEGEL Staff
The NSA's TAO hacking unit is considered to be the intelligence
agency's top secret weapon. It maintains its own covert network,
infiltrates computers around the world and even intercepts shipping
deliveries to plant back doors in electronics ordered by those it is
In January 2010, numerous homeowners in San Antonio, Texas, stood
baffled in front of their closed garage doors. They wanted to drive to
work or head off to do their grocery shopping, but their garage door
openers had gone dead, leaving them stranded. No matter how many times
they pressed the buttons, the doors didn't budge. The problem
primarily affected residents in the western part of the city, around
Military Drive and the interstate highway known as Loop 410.
In the United States, a country of cars and commuters, the mysterious
garage door problem quickly became an issue for local politicians.
Ultimately, the municipal government solved the riddle. Fault for the
error lay with the United States' foreign intelligence service, the
National Security Agency, which has offices in San Antonio. Officials
at the agency were forced to admit that one of the NSA's radio
antennas was broadcasting at the same frequency as the garage door
openers. Embarrassed officials at the intelligence agency promised to
resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and soon the doors began
opening again.
It was thanks to the garage door opener episode that Texans learned
just how far the NSA's work had encroached upon their daily lives. For
quite some time now, the intelligence agency has maintained a branch
with around 2,000 employees at Lackland Air Force Base, also in San
Antonio. In 2005, the agency took over a former Sony computer chip
plant in the western part of the city. A brisk pace of construction
commenced inside this enormous compound. The acquisition of the former
chip factory at Sony Place was part of a massive expansion the agency
began after the events of Sept. 11, 2001.
On-Call Digital Plumbers
One of the two main buildings at the former plant has since housed a
sophisticated NSA unit, one that has benefited the most from this
expansion and has grown the fastest in recent years -- the Office of
Tailored Access Operations, or TAO. This is the NSA's top operative
unit -- something like a squad of plumbers that can be called in when
normal access to a target is blocked.
According to internal NSA documents viewed by SPIEGEL, these on-call
digital plumbers are involved in many sensitive operations conducted
by American intelligence agencies. TAO's area of operations ranges
from counterterrorism to cyber attacks to traditional espionage. The
documents reveal just how diversified the tools at TAO's disposal have
become -- and also how it exploits the technical weaknesses of the IT
industry, from Microsoft to Cisco and Huawei, to carry out its
discreet and efficient attacks.
The unit is "akin to the wunderkind of the US intelligence community,"
says Matthew Aid, a historian who specializes in the history of the
NSA. "Getting the ungettable" is the NSA's own description of its
duties. "It is not about the quantity produced but the quality of
intelligence that is important," one former TAO chief wrote,
describing her work in a document. The paper seen by SPIEGEL quotes
the former unit head stating that TAO has contributed "some of the
most significant intelligence our country has ever seen." The unit, it
goes on, has "access to our very hardest targets."
A Unit Born of the Internet
Defining the future of her unit at the time, she wrote that TAO "needs
to continue to grow and must lay the foundation for integrated
Computer Network Operations," and that it must "support Computer
Network Attacks as an integrated part of military operations." To
succeed in this, she wrote, TAO would have to acquire "pervasive,
persistent access on the global network." An internal description of
TAO's responsibilities makes clear that aggressive attacks are an
explicit part of the unit's tasks. In other words, the NSA's hackers
have been given a government mandate for their work. During the middle
part of the last decade, the special unit succeeded in gaining access
to 258 targets in 89 countries -- nearly everywhere in the world. In
2010, it conducted 279 operations worldwide.
Indeed, TAO specialists have directly accessed the protected networks
of democratically elected leaders of countries. They infiltrated
networks of European telecommunications companies and gained access to
and read mails sent over Blackberry's BES email servers, which until
then were believed to be securely encrypted. Achieving this last goal
required a "sustained TAO operation," one document states.
This TAO unit is born of the Internet -- created in 1997, a time when
not even 2 percent of the world's population had Internet access and
no one had yet thought of Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. From the time
the first TAO employees moved into offices at NSA headquarters in Fort
Meade, Maryland, the unit was housed in a separate wing, set apart
from the rest of the agency. Their task was clear from the beginning

"IETF PKIX meeting minutes from the 56th IETF"
We were somewhere in San Francisco on the edge of the 56th IETF when
the drugs began to take hold.  I remember saying something like "I
feel a bit
lightheaded; maybe you should take notes...."  And suddenly there was a
terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge
OIDs, all swooping and screeching and diving around the RFC, which was about a
hundred pages long.  And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus!  Where are these
goddamn business cases?"
Then it was quiet again.  My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring
beer into his mouth, to facilitate the PKI standards-creation process.  "What

with his eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses.  "Never

We had two bags of X.509 standards, seventy-five pages of PKIX mailing list

vendor hype, and a whole galaxy of requirements, restrictions, promises,
threats...  Also, a quart of OSI, a quart of LDAP, a case of XML, a pint of
raw X.500, and two dozen PGPs.  Not that we needed all that for the trip, but
once you get into a serious PKI RFC binge, the tendency is to push it as far
as you can.  The only thing that really worried me was the X.500.  There is
nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man
in the depths of an X.500 binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff
pretty soon.

Edward Snowden can be kidnapped from Russia?
10.12.2013 14:57
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of NSA's total control systems can
be kidnapped from Russia. This is a priority for the British MI-6 and
the British Embassy, former NSA agent Wayne Madsen said, referring to
his colleagues.
Of course, nothing is known whether the CIA received the task, and
whether the U.S. Embassy is going to be involved in the activities to
try to kidnap Snowden. However, the British Embassy has already
tracked calls and letters of Snowden's "inner circle" and begun to
"dig up" their contacts in Moscow.
According to The Guardian, Snowden has the information, the disclosure
of which could become a nightmare for the U.S., even though the
fugitive NSA specialist decided not to disclose some of his data. In
addition, The Guardianadmitted that the media have so far published
"only 1%" of available information about NSA's total control over
billions of people in different countries.
Nevertheless, even this one percent has already made the UK
authorities introduce outright censorship against those who reveal
secrets of "global surveillance."
In particular, Wayne Madsen said that his girlfriend, who previously
worked for the National Security Agency as an expert on the Russian
language, tried to contact Snowden's acquaintances. Afterwards, she
was invited to come to the British Embassy and undergo special
training. She was also asked to report of FSB's interest in her
persons and communications.
The press quoted a former NSA expert, who said that the job to find
Snowden was of the highest priority for the embassy. Moreover, it was
said that the future operation to kidnap him involved number one MI-6
officer at the embassy, who worked under diplomatic cover as the
director for regional security.
The Center for the Study of Globalization has previously reported that
should the operation be successful, Snowden would be delivered to the
UK or the U.S. For the time being, the flywheel of total wiretapping
that Snowden launched was working against him to the utmost. "MI-6
intelligence agencies have begun to analyze the information they were
able to obtain through intelligence," the statement from the center
A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence, whom Politonline.ru
confidentially managed to talk to, said: "Although the Federal
Security Bureau does not do anything about human rights activist
Snowden, the service has been active in counterintelligence. I am
pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be
dramatically challenging." He also thanked "former NSA employees and
journalists for publishing such information, but added that
operational, technical and other measures to counter intelligence and
other illegal activities of foreign secret services on the territory
of Russia were  constantly maintained.
It only remains to add that the CIA has recently created a special
section in Russian on its official website, in which the department
offered Russian citizens (!) to join American intelligence. To choose
from, for example, the CIA offers engineering and technical
directions, a linguistic job, a secret agent with the knowledge of
Russian language and experts in business and analysts. The CIA
reportedly hopes to obtain classified information from newcomers in
the above areas to establish a new database of agents.

Certivox Asked That We Share Their Side of the Story on the PrivateSky Takedown.
The real story on the PrivateSky takedown.
Posted by Brian Spector on Thu, Dec 12, 2013
With the story about our PrivateSky takedown now public, I want to
take the opportunity to clarify a few points in various articles that
have appeared since yesterday covering the story.
Some headlines strongly infer our friends at GCHQ "forced" us to take
PrivateSky down. That's not the case.
Secondly, a very important point wasn't printed. GCHQ couldn't, by
law, request a blanket back door on the system. There are a very rigid
set of controls that mean only specific individuals can come under
surveillance. The legal request for such surveillance has a due
process that must be stridently followed. At no time did I or anyone
at CertiVox talk about CertiVox in relation to any RIPA warrant, only
the generic process by which these warrants are served.
By saying "our friends at GCHQ", there is no facetiousness intended.
The team at CertiVox have the upmost respect for the folks we
interacted with at GCHQ. They took the due process I outlined in the
previous point very seriously. We found that as an organisation, and
every individual involved there, were as worried about a breach of
public trust as much as we are.
Finally, I believe very strongly the following should be a larger part
of the public discourse of these subjects. What everyone needs to
understand is that every developed democracy in the world, even where
privacy rights are enshrined to the maximum efficacy by statute, has
laws on the books that mandate that Internet Service Providers have
facilities to work with law enforcement for the purposes of legal
intercept, to enforce public safety and security.
Being L.I. capable is a very important set features and functions that
must be in place for any credible, commercial service on the Internet.
In endeavouring to make PrivateSky as secure as possible, we
overlooked this critical requirement when we built PrivateSky.
When CertiVox positioned PrivateSky as the easiest to use and most
secure encrypted messaging service, we really had two significant
points of differentiation. First, even though we held the root
encryption keys to the system, it was architected in such as way that
it would have been all but impossible for our internal staff to snoop
on our customer's communications, or for the service to leak any of
our customer¹s data. Secondly, our possession of the root keys, and
our use of identity based encryption, made the system incredibly easy
to use. For the user, there were no private or public keys to manage,
every workflow was handled for the user in an easy to grasp pure HTML5
interface, no hardware or software required, just an HTML5 browser.
We boxed ourselves into a feature set and market position that when
called upon to comply with legal statues, we simply had no alternative
but to shut the service down. We built it, but we couldn't host it.
Why? Because as you can probably surmise, there is an inherent
impedance mismatch between being able to host a commercial
communications service that gives the upmost in privacy to its users,
against any breach, whilst at the same time being able to operate
safely within the confines of the law as it is on the books in most
countries on the planet.
In summary, it's the abuse of the communications interception in the
Snowden revelations that has everyone up in arms, as so it should. But
that¹s not what happened with PrivateSky.
What is our next move?

this is worth posting whole, particularly this observation:
... polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
i do have one comment, per:
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.
instead of having a "cyber security" profession, all aspects of
"information security", "software security", or "cyber security" as a
specialization should not exist.  competence and experience with these
subjects should be considered part of routine software and systems
development practice. (right now this is mostly impractical, however,
it need not always be so...)

.Trends in Cyber Security
.Dan Geer, 6 November 13, NRO
Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today, which, let
me be clear, is me speaking as myself and not for anybody or anything
else.  As you know, I work the cyber security trade, that is to say
that my occupation is cyber security.  Note that I said "occupation"
rather than "profession."  On 18 September, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences, on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security,
concluded that cyber security should be seen as an occupation and
not a profession because the rate of change is too great to consider
professionalization.[1]  You may well agree that that rate of change
is paramount and thus why cyber security is the most intellectually
demanding occupation on the planet.  In writing this essay, I will
keep my comments to trends rather than point estimates, just as you
asked in your invitation, but let me emphasize the wisdom of your
request by noting that the faster the rate of change, the more it
is trends that matter and not the value of any given variable at
any given time.  With luck, each of these trends will not be something
that you would argue with as a trend.  Argument, if any, will be
in their interpretation.
Note also that these trends do not constitute a set of mutually
exclusive, collectively exhaustive characterizations of the space
in which we live and work.  Some of them are correlated with others.
Some of them are newly emergent, some not.  Some of them are
reversible to a degree; some not reversible at all.  I am not, today
anyway, looking for causality.
Trend  Polarization
Much has been written about the increasing polarization of American
life.[2]  The middle is getting smaller whether we are noting that
only the middle class is shrinking, that it is the middle of the
country that is depopulating, that the political middle is lonelier
and lonelier, that both farms and banks are now only too small to
matter or too big to fail, that almost all journalism is now advocacy
journalism, that middle tier college education is a ticket to debt
and nothing else.
I submit that this trend towards polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
I'll come back to this first bullet at the end, but I mention it
first as polarization is becoming structural and of all the trends
the most telling.  You can confirm this by asking the best cyber
security people what they do on the Internet and what they won't
do on the Internet.  You will find it sharply different than what
the public at large does or will do.  The best people know the most,
and they are withdrawing, they are rejecting technologies.  To use
the words and style of the Intelligence Community, they are
Trend  Trends themselves
The idea that under the pressure of constant change about all you
can measure is the slope of the curve has gone from
don't-bother-me-with-math to everybody's-doing-it.  A Google search
for the phrase "information security trends" turns up 13,400 hits
and no two of the top ten are from the same source.  Consultancies
talk about what they are seeing in the back room, product vendors
talk about evolving needs, and reporters talk about what they are
seeing out on the street.
I am one of those folks.  A Wall Street colleague and I run the
Index of Cyber Security.[3]  The ICS is what is called a sentiment-based
index; if you are familiar with the US Consumer Confidence Index,[4]
then you already know what a sentiment-based index is.  Respondents
to the ICS are top drawer cyber security practitioners with direct
operational responsibility who share, each month, how their view
of security in several areas has changed since the month before.
Because there are no absolutes in cyber security, not even widely
agreed upon definitions of the core terms that make up cyber security
practice, a sentiment-based Index is, in fact, the best decision
support that can be done.
The Index asks the respondents monthly whether each of two dozen
different risks has gotten better, gotten worse, gotten a lot better,
gotten a lot worse, or stayed the same since the month before.  Out
of this, the Index of Cyber Security is calculated and released at
6pm on the last calendar day of the month, in further similarity
to the Consumer Confidence Index.  We write an analytic annual
report that I have given to the organizers for your further reading.
As an index of risk, a higher ICS number means higher risk.  That
risk number has risen, and seems likely to continue to rise.  It
is a composite trend line, but what is more interesting is that the
components of the risk are much more varied, i.e., what is the
dominating risk one month may not be the next.  We think that this
captures, in part, the dynamic nature of cyber security and does
so in a way not otherwise being done.  Respondents seem to agree
that the ICS does offer decision support to front-line people such
as themselves.
Trend  then, is that there is increasingly wide acceptance that
absolute measures are not worth seeking and a kind of confirmation
that cyber security is a practice, not a device.
Trend  Physics and its impact on data
As you well know, more and more data is collected and more and more
of that data is in play.  The general, round-numbers dynamic of
this trend are these: Moore's Law continues to give us two orders
of magnitude in compute power per dollar per decade while storage
grows at three orders of magnitude and bandwidth at four.  These
are top-down economic drivers and they relentlessly warp what is
the economically optimum computing model.  The trend is clear; the
future is increasingly dense with stored data but, paradoxically,
despite the massive growth of data volume, that data becomes more
mobile with time.
As is obvious, this bears on cyber security as data is what cyber
security is all about.  In 2007, Jim Gray gave a seminal talk[5]
about the transformation of science, coining the term "fourth
paradigm."  By that he meant that the history of science is that
science began as an endeavor organized around empirical observation.
After that came the age of theory -- theorizing as the paradigm of
what science did.  Then science became computational, again meaning
that the paradigm of what science did was to calculate.  His argument
for a fourth era was that of a paradigm shift from computational
science to data intensive science.  You here at NRO need no primer
on the power of that shift in paradigm, but I am here to tell you
that cyber security is embracing that fourth paradigm and it is
doing it now.
Ecology professor Philip Greear would challenge his graduate students
to catalog all the life in a cubic yard of forest floor.  Computer
science professor Donald Knuth would challenge his graduate students
to catalog everything their computers had done in the last ten
seconds.  It is hard to say which is more difficult, but everywhere
you look, cyber security practitioners are trying to get a handle
on "What is normal?" so that that which is abnormal can be identified
early in the game.  Behavioral approaches leading towards intrusion
detection are exactly the search for anomaly, and they are data
based.  The now-famous attack on RSA Data Security that led to RSA
buying Net Witness is an example of wanting to know everything so
as to recognize something.  I'm on the record at book length [6]
that the central organizing principle behind a competent security
program is to instrument your data sufficiently well that nothing
moves without it being noticed.  Physics has made it possible to
put computers everywhere.  Physics has made it possible to fill
them all with data.
Cyber security is barely keeping up, and not just because of two,
three, or four orders of magnitude in the physics upstream of the
Trend  Need for prediction
We all know that knowledge is power.  We all know that there is a
subtle yet important distinction between information and knowledge.
We all know that a negative declaration like "X did not happen" can
be only proven if you have the enumeration of *everything* that did
happen and can show that X is not in it.  We all know that a stitch
in time saves nine, but only if we know where to put the stitch.
We all know that without security metrics, the outcome is either
overspending or under protecting.
The more technologic the society becomes, the greater the dynamic
range of possible failures.  When you live in a cave, starvation,
predators, disease, and lightning are about the full range of
failures that end life as you know it and you are well familiar
with all of them.  When you live in a technologic society where
everybody and everything is optimized in some way akin to just-in-time
delivery, the dynamic range of failures is incomprehensibly larger
and largely incomprehensible.  The wider the dynamic range of
failure, the more prevention is the watchword.  As technologic
society grows more interdependent within itself, the more it must
rely on prediction based on data collected in broad ways, not
targeted ways.
Some define risk as the probability of a failure times the cost of
that failure.  To be clear, a trend in favor of making predictions
is a trend subsidiary to a trend in the cost of failure.  I've
written at length elsewhere about how an increasing downside cost
of failure requires that we find ways to be resilient, but not
resilient in the sense of rich redundancy, not resilient in the
sense of having quick recovery mechanisms, but resilient in the
sense of having alternate primary means that do not share common
mode risks.  As such, I strongly recommend that manual means be
preserved wherever possible because whatever those manual means
are, they are already fully capitalized and they do not share common
mode risk with digital means.
There is now more information security risk sloshing around the
economy than could actually be accepted were it exposed.  The
tournament now turns to who can minimize their risk the best, which,
in the civilian economy at large, means who can most completely
externalize their downside information security costs.  The weapons
here are perhaps as simple as the wisdom of Delphi, "Know thyself"
and "Nothing to excess" -- know thyself in the sense of quantitative
rigor and a perpetual propensity to design information systems with
failure in mind; nothing to excess in the sense of mimicking the
biologic world's proof by demonstration that species diversity is
the greatest bulwark against loss of an ecosystem.
Trend  Abandonment
If I abandon a car on the street, then eventually someone will be
able to claim title.  If I abandon a bank account, then the State
will eventually seize it.  If I abandon real estate by failing to
remedy a trespass, then in the fullness of time adverse possession
takes over.  If I don't use my trademark, then my rights go over
to those who use what was and could have remained mine.  If I abandon
my spouse and/or children, then everyone is taxed to remedy my
actions.  If I abandon a patent application, then after a date
certain the teaching that it proposes passes over to the rest of
you.  If I abandon my hold on the confidentiality of data such as
by publishing it, then that data passes over to the commonweal not
to return.  If I abandon my storage locker, then it will be lost
to me and may end up on reality TV.  The list goes on.
Apple computers running 10.5 or less get no updates (comprising
about half the installed base).  Any Microsoft computer running XP
gets no updates (comprising about half the installed base).  The
end of security updates follows abandonment.  It is certainly ironic
that freshly pirated copies of Windows get security updates when
older versions bought legitimately do not.
Stating the obvious, if Company X abandons a code base, then that
code base should be open sourced.  Irrespective of security issues,
many is the time that a bit of software I use has gone missing
because its maker went missing.  But with respect to security, some
constellation of {I,we,they,you} are willing and able to provide
security patches or workarounds as time and evil require.
Would the public interest not be served, then, by a conversion to
open source for abandoned code bases?  But wait, you say, isn't
purchased software on a general purpose computer a thing of the
past?  Isn't the future auto-updated smartphone clients transacting
over armored private (carrier) networks to auto-updated cloud
services?  Maybe; maybe not.  If the two major desktop suppliers
update only half of today's desktops, then what percentage will
they update tomorrow?
If you say "Make them try harder!," then the legalistic, regulatory
position is your position, and the ACLU is already trying that
route.  If smartphone auto-update becomes a condition of merchantability
and your smartphone holds the keying material that undeniably says
that its user is you, then how long before a FISA court orders a
special auto-update to *your* phone for evidence gathering?
If you say "But we already know what they're going to do, don't
we?," then the question is what about the abandoned code bases.
Open-sourcing abandoned code bases is the worst option, except for
all the others.  But if seizing an abandoned code base is too big
a stretch for you before breakfast, then start with a Public Key
Infrastructure Certifying Authority that goes bankrupt and ask "Who
gets the keys?"
Trend  Interdependence
The essential character of a free society is this: That which is
not forbidden is permitted.  The essential character of an unfree
society is the inverse, that which is not permitted is forbidden.
The U.S. began as a free society without question; the weight of
regulation, whether open or implicit, can only push it toward being
unfree.  Under the pressure to defend against offenders with a
permanent structural advantage, defenders who opt for forbidding
anything that is not expressly permitted are cultivating a computing
environment that does not embody the freedom with which we are
heretofore familiar.
Put concretely, the central expression of a free society is a free
market, and the cardinal measure of a free market is the breadth
of real choice -- choice that goes beyond color and trim and body
style to choices that optimize discordant, antithetical goal states.
The level of choice on the Internet is draining down.  You may revel
in the hundreds of thousands of supposedly new voices that have
found a way to chatter in full view.  You may note that new "apps"
for Android plus iPhone are appearing at over a thousand per day.
You may rightly remind us all that technology is democratizing in
the sense that powers once reserved for the few are now irretrievably
in the hands of the many.  What stands against that, and why I say
that it stands against that, is increasing interdependence.
We humans can design systems more complex than we can then operate.
The financial sector's "flash crashes" are an example of that;
perhaps the fifty interlocked insurance exchanges for Obamacare
will soon be another.  Above some threshold of system complexity,
it is no longer possible to test, it is only possible to react to
emergent behavior.  The lowliest Internet user is entirely in the
game of interdependence -- one web page can easily touch scores of
different domains.  While writing this, the top level page from
cnn.com had 400 out-references to 85 unique domains each of which
is likely to be similarly constructed and all of which move data
one way or another.  If you leave those pages up and they have an
auto-refresh, then moving to a new network signals to every one of
those ad networks that you have so moved.
The wellspring of risk is dependence, especially dependence on
shared expectations of shared system state, i.e., interdependence
on the ground.  If you would accept that you are most at risk from
the things you most depend upon, then damping dependence is the
cheapest, most straightforward, lowest latency way to damp risk,
just as the fastest and most reliable way to put more money on a
business's bottom line is through cost control.
Trend  Automation
Shoshana Zuboff of the Harvard Business School notably described
three laws of the digital age,
. Everything that can be automated will be automated.
. Everything that can be informated will be informated.
. Every digital application that can be used for surveillance and
.    control will be used for surveillance and control.
It is irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent to argue otherwise.
For security technology, Zuboff's Laws are almost the goal state,
that is to say that the attempt to automate information assurance
is in full swing everywhere, the ability to extract information
from the observable is in full swing everywhere, and every digital
application is being instrumented.
Before In-Q-Tel, I worked for a data protection company.  Our product
was, and I believe still is, the most thorough on the market.  By
"thorough" I mean the dictionary definition, "careful about doing
something in an accurate and exact way."  To this end, installing
our product instrumented every system call on the target machine.
Data did not and could not move in any sense of the word "move"
without detection.  Every data operation was caught and monitored.
It was total surveillance data protection.  What made this product
stick out was that very thoroughness, but here is the point: Unless
you fully instrument your data handling, it is not possible for you
to say what did not happen.  With total surveillance, and total
surveillance alone, it is possible to treat the absence of evidence
as the evidence of absence.  Only when you know everything that
*did* happen with your data can you say what did *not* happen with
your data.
But this trend of automating is now leaving the purely defensive
position behind.  In a press release two weeks ago today,[7] DARPA
signaled exactly that, and I quote
   [T]he Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency intends to hold
   the Cyber Grand Challenge -- the first-ever tournament for fully
   automatic network defense systems.  DARPA envisions teams creating
   automated systems that would compete against each other to
   evaluate software, test for vulnerabilities, generate security
   patches and apply them to protected computers on a network.  The
   growth trends ... in cyber attacks and malware point to a future
   where automation must be developed...
The automation trend is irreversible, but it begs a question that
I fear no one will answer in a way that doesn't merely reflect their
corporate or institutional interest, namely are people in the loop
a failsafe or a liability?[8]
Trend  Dual use
I've become convinced that all security technology is dual use.
While I am not sure whether dual use is a trend or a realization
of an unchanging fact of nature, the obviousness of dual use seems
greatest in the latest technologies, so I am calling it a trend in
the sense that the straightforward accessibility of dual use
characteristics of new technology is a growing trend.
There are a lot of examples, but in the physical world any weapon
usable for defense can be repurposed for offense.  Every security
researcher looking for exploitable flaws is deep in the dual use
debate because once discovered, those flaws can be patched or they
can be sold.  The cyber security products that promise total
surveillance over the enterprise are, to my mind, an offensive
strategy used for defensive purposes.
There was a time when flaws were predominantly found by adventurers
and braggarts.  Ten plus years of good work by the operating system
vendors elbowed the flaw finders out of the operating system and,
as a result, our principal opponents changed over from adventurers
and braggarts to being professionals.  Finding vulnerabilities and
exploiting them is now hard enough that it has moved out of the
realm of being a hobby and into the realm of being a job.  This
changed several things, notably that braggarts share their findings
because they are paid in bragging rights.  By contrast, professionals
do not share and are paid in something more substantial than fame.
The side effect has been a continued rise in the percentage of all
vulnerabilities that are previously unknown.  The trend, in other
words, is that by crushing hobbyists we've raised the market price
of working exploits to where now our opponents pay for research and
development out of revenue.
Simulating what the opponent can do thus remains the central task
of defensive research.  Much of that research is in crafting proofs
of concept that such and such a flaw can be taken advantage of.
Corman's neologism of "HD Moore's Law" says that the trend in the
power of the casual attacker grows as does the trend of the power
in Metasploit.[9] It is hard to think of a better description of
dual use.
Trend  The blurring of end-to-end
To my mind, the most important technical decision ever made was
that the security of the Internet was to be "end-to-end."[10]
"End-to-end" is a generic technical term yet simple to explain: the
Internet was built on the premise that two entities could connect
themselves to each other and decide what they wanted to do.  The
network was a delivery vehicle, but the form, content, and security
of the connection between the two ends was to be their own choice.
End-to-end is a model where the terminal entities are smart and the
network is dumb.  This is completely (completely) different than a
smart network with dumb terminal entities at the end of the wire.
No other design decision of the Internet comes close to the importance
of it's being an end-to-end design.  With end-to-end, security is
the choice of the terminal end-points, not something built into the
fabric of the Internet itself.  That is American values personified.
It is the idea that accountability, not permission seeking, is the
way a government curbs the misuse of freedoms, and, as accountability
scales but permission seeking does not, accountability wins.
End-to-end security is the digital manifestation of the right of
association and, in any case, is what enabled the Internet to become
relevant in the first place.  End-to-end does precisely what Peter
Drucker told us to do: "Don't solve problems, create opportunities."
The provision of content from anywhere to anywhere, which is the
very purpose of an internetwork, is a challenge to sovereignty.
America's Founders wanted no sovereign at all, and they devised a
government that made the center all but powerless and the periphery
fully able to thumb its nose at whatever it felt like.  Much ink
has been spilled on the frontier ethic versus the wishful policies
favored by the comfortable urbanity of the welfare state, but the
Internet's protocols have everything in common with the former and
nothing in common with the latter.
The free man requires the choice of with what degree of vigor to
defend himself.  That is a universal; America's Founders laid that
down in the Second Amendment, just as did George Orwell in the
English democratic socialist weekly "Tribune" when he said, "That
rifle on the wall of the laborer's cottage or working class flat
is the symbol of democracy.  It is our job to see that it stays
there."  Were George Washington or George Orwell still among us,
they would know that smart end-points and dumb networks are what
freedom requires, that smart networks protecting dumb end-points
breed compliant dependency.
But the trend is otherwise, and not just because of the fatuous
fashionability of entitlement, but rather because of a blurring of
what the term "end" means.  So very many people have adopted automatic
synchronization of multiple devices they own that one has to ask
whether their tablet is an end or their collection of mutually
synchronized devices is an end.  So many Internet-dependent functions
are spread silently across numerous entities and applications that
what is the end may well be more dynamic than can be described.  If
an end implies unitary control on the part of an owner, then set
theory says that mutually synchronized devices are a unitary end.
That blurring of "end" makes end-to-end provisioning problematic
as a set of devices cannot be assumed to be equally on and equally
participating in any given transaction.  Quoting Clark & Blumenthal[11]
   There is a risk that the range of new requirements now emerging
   could have the consequence of compromising the Internet's original
   design principles.  Were this to happen, the Internet might lose
   some of its key features, in particular its ability to support
   new and unanticipated applications.  We link this possible outcome
   to a number of trends: the rise of new stakeholders in the
   Internet,...  new government interests, the changing motivations
   of the growing user base, and the tension between the demand for
   trustworthy overall operation and the inability to trust the
   behavior of individual users.
This is nowhere so evident as in security, that is to say in the
application of the end-to-end principle to cyber security.  What
does end-to-end secure transport mean when travelocity.com is showing
you a page dynamically constructed from a dozen other entities?
Trend  Complexity in the supply chain
Even without resorting to classified information, it is now clear
that supply chain attacks have occurred.  Whether reading journalistic
accounts or Richard Clarke's novel _Breakpoint_, the finding is
that the supply chain creates opportunities for badness.  None of
the things I've yet read, however, blames the supply chain risk on
its complexity, per se, but that is the trend that matters.
Security is non-composable -- we can get insecure results even when
our systems are assembled from secure components.  The more components,
the less likely a secure result.  This applies to supply chains
that are growing ever more complex under the pressure of just-in-time,
spot market sourcing of, say, memory chips and so forth and so on.
Because the attacker has only to find one component of that chain
to be vulnerable while the defender has to assure that all components
are invulnerable, rising supply chain complexity guarantees increased
opportunity for effective attack.  It cannot do otherwise, and the
trend is clear.
Trend  Monoculture(s)
Beginning with Forrest in 1997,[12] regular attention has been paid
to the questions of monoculture in the network environment.  There
is no point belaboring the fundamental question, but let me state
it for the record: cascade failure is so very much easier to detonate
in a monoculture -- so very much easier when the attacker has only
to write one bit of malware, not ten million.  The idea is obvious;
believing in it is easy; acting on its implications is, evidently,
rather hard.
I am entirely sympathetic to the actual reason we continue to deploy
computing monocultures -- making everything almost entirely alike
is, and remains, our only hope for being able to centrally manage
it in a consistent manner.  Put differently, when you deploy a
computing monoculture you are making a fundamental risk management
decision: That the downside risk of a black swan event is more
tolerable than the downside risk of perpetual inconsistency.  This
is a hard question, as all risk management is about changing the
future, not explaining the past.  Which would you rather have, the
unlikely event of a severe impact, or the day-to-day burden of
perpetual inconsistency?
When we opt for monocultures we had better opt for tight central
control.  This supposes that we are willing to face the risks that
come with tight central control, of course, including the maximum
risk of all auto-update schemes, namely the hostile takeover of the
auto-update mechanism itself.  Computer desktops are not the point;
embedded systems are.  The trendline in the number of critical
monocultures seems to be rising and many of these are embedded
systems both without a remote management interface and long lived.
That combination -- long lived and not reachable -- is the trend
that must be reversed.  Whether to insist that embedded devices
self destruct at some age or that remote management of them be a
condition of deployment is the question.  In either case, the
Internet of Things and the appearance of microcontrollers in seemingly
every computing device should raise hackles on every neck.[13]
Trend  Attack surface growth versus skill growth
Everyone here knows the terminology "attack surface" and knows that
one of the defender's highest goals is to minimize the attack surface
wherever possible.  Every coder adhering to a security-cognizant
software lifecycle program does this.  Every company or research
group engaged in static analysis of binaries does this.  Every
agency enforcing a need-to-know regime for data access does this.
Every individual who reserves one low-limit credit card for their
Internet purchases does this.  I might otherwise say that any person
who encrypts their e-mail to their closest counterparties does this,
but because consistent e-mail encryption is so rare, encrypting
one's e-mail marks it for collection and indefinite retention by
those entities in a position to do so, regardless of what country
you live in.
In cyber security practice, the trend is that we practitioners as
a class are getting better and better.  We have better tools, we
have better understood practices, and we have more colleagues.
That's the plus side.  But I'm interested in the ratio of skill to
challenge, and as far as I can estimate, we are expanding the
society-wide attack surface faster than we are expanding our
collection of tools, practices, and colleagues.  If you are growing
more food, that's great.  If your population is growing faster than
your improvements in food production can keep up, that's bad.
In the days of radio, there was Sarnoff's Law, namely that the value
of a broadcast network was proportional to N, the number of listeners.
Then came packetized network communications and Metcalfe's Law,
that the value of a network was proportional to N squared, the
number of possible two-way conversations.  We are now in the era
of Reed's Law where the value of a network is proportional to the
number of groups that can form in it, that is to say 2 to the power
N.  Reed's Law is the new reality because it fits the age of social
networks.  In each of these three laws as publicly stated, the sign
bit is positive, but in parallel with the claim that everything is
dual use, the sign bit can also be negative because interconnections
are a contributor to the net attack surface.  If an Internet of
Things is indeed imminent, then the upward bend in the curve of the
global attack surface will grow steeper regardless of what level
of risk there is for any one thing so long as that level of risk
is always non-zero.
Trend  Specialization
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.  Statisticians, civil engineers, and
lawyers alike can contribute.  But the increasing quality of prepatory
education, the increasing breadth of affairs for which cyber security
is needful, and the increasing demand for skill of the highest sort
means the humans in the game are specializing.
While some people like to say "Specialization is for insects," tell
me that the security field itself is not specializing.  We have
people who are expert in forensics on specific operating system
localizations, expert in setting up intrusion response, expert in
analyzing large sets of firewall rules using non-trivial set theory,
expert in designing egress filters for universities that have no
ingress filters, expert in steganographically watermarking binaries,
and so forth.  Generalists are becoming rare, and they are being
replaced by specialists.  This is biologic speciation in action,
and the narrowing of ecologic niches.  In rough numbers, there are
somewhere close to 5,000 various technical certifications you can
get in the computer field, and the number of them is growing thus
proving the conjecture of specialization and speciation is not just
for insects and it will not stop.

of course; the complete details will be slow to arrive, not least
because detailed description requires a demonstration in a
reproduction test setup, rather than reporting of actual traffic. :/
that said, useful aspects i'll certainly provide on whim or request.
the defining characteristics of the two types of attacks:
DC19 with DRT:
- "high power on-site", less descriminant attacks. target by and
limited to location.
- MitM for system, application, and protocol level attacks. Evilgrade,
MasterKey vulns, etc.  mostly known and a few 0day escalated attacks.
- favorite attack: "Google Voice Search" always-on eavesdropper
payload; Speex voice from all audible participants.
DC20 with Alexander's toys:
- "in the towers", highly targeted to specific devices, active over
wide metro area.
- baseband exploit vector for device key retrieval, memory and storage
forensics, exfiltration.
- PDoS attacks (bricked secondary devices used as fall back once
identified by call graph; ~20 hours)
- favorite attack: baseband pwn in airplane mode, with ex-filtration
over custom channel.
DC21: no appearance (observed).  speculation ongoing...
reversing attacker capabilities, toolkits, TTPs, humanpower/hours, a
much longer tangent.  but this assertion is based on correlation of
the observed power, capacity, and protocols in specific bands
implemented by the attacker with the capabilities of the DRT system.
multiple locations, terabytes of captured spectrum, patience and
as for who was operating it - unknown beyond the usual suspects, which
is a small set due to the restricted distribution of both the hardware
platform and the exploit kit atop it :)
i'll send more details once available.  the details and distribution
to be part of a separate FOIPA effort for US citizen security
enthusiasts that might be of interest to those following this thread.

this does bring up an interesting point:
while it may be more efficient to use the same "key" for the DRBG
output across all processor lines, it would be more secure to use a
different key per line.  this implies that each iteration of Sandy
Bridge -> Ivy Bridge -> Haswell needs to be "enabled" by CCP, with
Xeon E5 debut in 2013 as discussed.
for Sandy Bridge, this would have shown in 2010? and unless in network
equipment described simply as "enabling decryption for Sandy Bridge
used by $operating systems and $applications."
sadly we'll have to wait a while to confirm this conjecture for
Haswell.  and we'll have to wait forever for more leaks apparently, as
the continuing decline of details demonstrates...

the bulk of 2012 was consume user hardware.  the endpoint is a totally

only server Ivy Bridge: Xeon E3 in mid-2012.
the cores pushed in the SDN initiatives above came out not so many months ago...
high capacity crypto aggregation points like this are an ideal target,
with backdoor keying of VPN/SSL the ideal (passive) attack with their

but not released, and "enabling" means tied into X-KEYSCORE,
TRAFFICTHIEF, whatever else gets draped off UPSTREAM...
the backdoors for all the other vendor hardware happened in years
prior.  HSMs and crypto accelerator gear is not exactly a vibrant or
competitive market.  in fact, these companies never seem to die, just
carry on with decent margins riding on incremental design upgrades
until they're bought out by a larger/growing competitor. ;)
of course, this could be because companies like Sun charge $9,999 for
an HSM/accelerator that is at best a reasonable cost at $1,499...

i even have a list of candidates you can experiment with to confirm
Intel Ivy Bridge as best fit. [0]
plus a few more things, e.g. your ~250-300million $USD/year budget goes toward:
"actively engag[ing] the US and foreign IT industries to covertly
influence and/or overtly leverage their commercial products' designs
[... to] make the systems in question exploitable through SIGINT
collection (e.g., Endpoint, MidPoint, etc.) with foreknowledge of the

systems, IT systems, networks and endpoint communications devices used
by targets.
only with "foreknowledge of the modification" are you able to utilize
this backdoor. (NSA does not like to share)
also, this year by end of year, in 2013 you expect to:
- Make gains in enabling decryption and Computer Network Exploitation
(CNE) access to fourth generation/Long Term Evolution (4GL/LTE)
networks by inserting vulnerabilities.
- Complete enabling for [well recognized name] encryption chips used
in Virtual Private Network and Web encryption devices.
and last but not least,
- Shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace to make it

Ok, given those requirements. Who fits the bill?
High end platform:
Intel targets what it believes is a significant growth opportunity to
bring the Intel Architecture into a rapidly evolving networking space.
Intel added to its portfolio with the introduction of the Highland
Forest platform, which combines the vendors Xeon E5-2600 v2 CPU with
its new Coleto Creek chipset. Price said Highland Forest  which can
pack up to 20 2.4GHz Ivy Bridge CPU cores  will offer two to six
times the performance of the previous Crystal Forest platform, which
was launched in October 2012.
Highland Forest, with Intels Data Plane Development Kit, can deliver
up to 255 million packets per second (p/s)  more than the 140 million
p/s from Crystal Forest  as well as security capabilities of 110
Gigabits per second of IPsec and 200 Gb/s SSL security for encrypted
IPsec (VPN) and SSL (Web crypto) and lots of it!  sounds interesting.
tell me more!
other market points of note:
- "Intel currently has over 15 SDN/NFV qualification trials underway
with carriers in all major regions.  Schooler emphasized that Intel
has no intention to sell directly to service providers and is fully
committed to launching an Intel Network Builders Ecosystem of industry
players supporting the Intel Architecture."

hey Wind River, how are you using RDRAND?
now what about Intel themselves, are they also pushing the chip?
Intel officials are making aggressive moves to expand the reach of its
silicon beyond servers and into other parts of the data centre.
Schooler said the company has been making products for networking gear
for about a decade, and has made significant strides in recent years.
Its also made several acquisitions  such as of Sensory Networks,
Ethernet chip maker Fulcrum Microsystems and networking software maker
Aepona, whose technology enables telecoms and cloud service providers
to offer more services on their networks.
Intel is looking to take advantage of the growth opportunity
networking represents, Schooler said. The market Intel is targeting is
about $16 billion (£9.7bn), and the chip maker currently has about 5
percent of it. Along with its x86 architecture, Intel also is
developing accelerator chips for such jobs as packet inspection and
whew.  that's a lot of context and circumstance.  let's look back over
your goals for 2013:

i will admit that i am continually impressed by NSA/SCS achievements.

my reading between the lines: it is not a special chip, it is a

encryption, which is an excellent point to aggregate a vulnerability
in keying ciphers. (ignore public key for now, since we can just focus

"used in Virtual Private Network" == PPTP,IPsec,OpenVPN,etc.
"Web encryption devices" == in my interpretation, this is any targeted

and rack mount server...  any of these platforms could speak VPN or
Web crypto.  TAO/SCS do like to get into the switches though ;)
mostly "cloud infrastructure", "software defined data center", and the like:
back in the day, Sun got tired of the (relatively) slow performance
and latency of crypto offloading via bus and simply threw it into the
core.  you were still offloading crypto, but within the CPU.
also note that endpoint compromises sufficient to decrypt VPN or
secure web traffic is already present in TAO/CNE's tasking.  this
effort [CCP_00009] may focus on VPN concentrator / secure web proxy
deployments specifically to handle the RDRAND lookup per their private
starting counter.
previous back doors have also used entropy leakage sufficient to bring
a brute force attack into reasonable effort, while still denying third
parties a class break of the entropy / keys used.  this type of key
space search is not done on the ground with portable CNE but instead
back at SCS...
on a related tangent, the lack of additional disclosures is quite

also note that they use frequencies >10kHz.  as discussed in the high
frequency audio covert channel, this range is fairly contention free
and easily accessible to microphones in consumer electronics of
various types.
Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack,
applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can
extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of
various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the
computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We
experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using
either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more
sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.
Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack
can be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer
chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target
computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information
from the ground wires remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet

NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show
By Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani, Wednesday, December 4, 12:18 PM
The National Security Agency is gathering nearly 5 billion records a
day on the whereabouts of cellphones around the world, according to
top-secret documents and interviews with U.S. intelligence officials,
enabling the agency to track the movements of individuals  and map
their relationships  in ways that would have been previously
The records feed a vast database that stores information about the
locations of at least hundreds of millions of devices, according to
the officials and the documents, which were provided by former NSA
contractorEdward Snowden. New projects created to analyze that data
have provided the intelligence community with what amounts to a mass
surveillance tool.
(Video: How the NSA uses cellphone tracking to find and develop targets)
The NSA does not target Americans location data by design, but the
agency acquires a substantial amount of information on the whereabouts
of domestic cellphones incidentally, a legal term that connotes a
foreseeable but not deliberate result.
One senior collection manager, speaking on condition of anonymity but
with permission from the NSA, said we are getting vast volumes of
location data from around the world by tapping into the cables that
connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as
well as foreign ones. Additionally, data is often collected from the
tens of millions of Americans who travel abroad with their cellphones
every year.
In scale, scope and potential impact on privacy, the efforts to
collect and analyze location data may be unsurpassed among the NSA
surveillance programsthat have been disclosed since June. Analysts can
find cellphones anywhere in the world, retrace their movements and
expose hidden relationships among individuals using them.
(Graphic: How the NSA is tracking people right now)
U.S. officials said the programs that collect and analyze location
data are lawful and intended strictly to develop intelligence about
foreign targets.
Robert Litt, general counsel for the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, said there is no
element of the intelligence community that under any authority is
intentionally collecting bulk cellphone location information about
cellphones in the United States.
The NSA has no reason to suspect that the movements of the
overwhelming majority of cellphone users would be relevant to national
security. Rather, it collects locations in bulk because its most
powerful analytic tools  known collectively as CO-TRAVELER  allow it
to look for unknown associates of known intelligence targets by
tracking people whose movements intersect.
Still, location data, especially when aggregated over time, is widely
regarded among privacy advocates as uniquely sensitive. Sophisticated
mathematical techniques enable NSA analysts to map cellphone owners
relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with
thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.
Cellphones broadcast their locations even when they are not being used
to place a call or send a text.
(Video: Reporter Ashkan Soltani explains NSA collection of cellphone data)
CO-TRAVELER and related tools require the methodical collection and
storage of location data on what amounts to a planetary scale. The
government is tracking people from afar into confidential business
meetings or personal visits to medical facilities, hotel rooms,
private homes and other traditionally protected spaces.
One of the key components of location data, and why its so
sensitive, is that the laws of physics dont let you keep it private,
said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil
Liberties Union. People who value their privacy can encrypt their
e-mails and disguise their online identities, but the only way to
hide your location is to disconnect from our modern communication
system and live in a cave.
The NSA cannot know in advance which tiny fraction of 1 percent of the
records it may need, so it collects and keeps as many as it can  27
terabytes, by one account, or more than double the text content of the
Library of Congresss print collection.
The location programs have brought in such volumes of information,
according to a May 2012 internal NSA briefing, that they are
outpacing our ability to ingest, process and store data. In the
ensuing year and a half, the NSA has been transitioning to a
processing system that provided it with greater capacity.
The possibility that the intelligence community has been collecting
location data, particularly of Americans, has long concerned privacy
advocates and some lawmakers. Three Democratic senators  Ron Wyden
(Ore.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Barbara Mikulski (Md.)  have
introduced an amendment to the 2014 defense spending bill that would
require U.S. intelligence agencies to say whether they have ever
collected or made plans to collect location data for a large number
of United States persons with no known connection to suspicious
NSA Director Keith Alexander disclosed in Senate testimony in October
that the NSA had run a pilot project in 2010 and 2011 to collect
samples of U.S. cellphone location data. The data collected were
never available for intelligence analysis purposes, and the project
was discontinued because it had no operational value, he said.
Alexander allowed that a broader collection of such data may be
something that is a future requirement for the country, but it is not
right now.
The number of Americans whose locations are tracked as part of the
NSAs collection of data overseas is impossible to determine from the
Snowden documents alone, and senior intelligence officials declined to
offer an estimate.
Its awkward for us to try to provide any specific numbers, one
intelligence official said in a telephone interview. An NSA
spokeswoman who took part in the call cut in to say the agency has no
way to calculate such a figure.
An intelligence lawyer, speaking with his agencys permission, said
location data are obtained by methods tuned to be looking outside the
United States, a formulation he repeated three times. When U.S.
cellphone data are collected, he said, the data are not covered by the
Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
According to top-secret briefing slides, the NSA pulls in location
data around the world from 10 major sigads, or signals intelligence
activity designators.
A sigad known as STORMBREW, for example, relies on two unnamed
corporate partners described only as ARTIFICE and WOLFPOINT. According
to an NSA site inventory, the companies administer the NSAs physical
systems, or interception equipment, and NSA asks nicely for
STORMBREW collects data from 27 telephone links known as OPC/DPC
pairs, which refer to originating and destination points and which
typically transfer traffic from one providers internal network to
anothers. That data include cell tower identifiers, which can be used
to locate a phones location.
The agencys access to carriers networks appears to be vast.
Many shared databases, such as those used for roaming, are available
in their complete form to any carrier who requires access to any part
of it, said Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and
information science at the University of Pennsylvania. This flat
trust model means that a surprisingly large number of entities have
access to data about customers that they never actually do business
with, and an intelligence agency  hostile or friendly  can get one
stop shopping to an expansive range of subscriber data just by
compromising a few carriers.
Some documents in the Snowden archive suggest that acquisition of U.S.
location data is routine enough to be cited as an example in training
materials. In an October 2012 white paper on analytic techniques, for
example, the NSAs counterterrorism analysis unit cites two U.S.-based
carriers to illustrate the challenge of correlating the travels of
phone users on different mobile networks. Asked about that, a U.S.
intelligence official said the example was poorly chosen and did not
represent the programs foreign focus.
The NSAs capabilities to track location are staggering, based on the
Snowden documents, and indicate that the agency is able to render most
efforts at communications security effectively futile.
Like encryption and anonymity tools online, which are used by
dissidents, journalists and terrorists alike, security-minded behavior
 using disposable cellphones and switching them on only long enough
to make brief calls  marks a user for special scrutiny. CO-TRAVELER
takes note, for example, when a new telephone connects to a cell tower
soon after another nearby device is used for the last time.
Side-by-side security efforts  when nearby devices power off and on
together over time  assist in determining whether co-travelers are
associated  through behaviorally relevant relationships, according
to the 24-page white paper, which was developed by the NSA in
partnership with the National Geospatial Agency, the Australian
Signals Directorate and private contractors.
A central feature of each of these tools is that they do not rely on
knowing a particular target in advance, or even suspecting one. They
operate on the full universe of data in the NSAs FASCIA repository,
which stores trillions of metadata records, of which a large but
unknown fraction include locations.
The most basic analytic tools map the date, time, and location of
cellphones to look for patterns or significant moments of overlap.
Other tools compute speed and trajectory for large numbers of mobile
devices, overlaying the electronic data on transportation maps to
compute the likely travel time and determine which devices might have
To solve the problem of undetectable surveillance against CIA officers
stationed overseas, one contractor designed an analytic model that
would carefully record the case officers path and look for other
mobile devices in steady proximity.
Results have not been validated by operational analysts, the report said.

@_subject: NSA morale down 
the portrayals from the brass and insiders is, "the administration is
not showing enough support!".
i have to wonder: how many rank and file are feeling betrayed by the
NSA administration instead?   they're now getting a look into all the
SCI bits they were compartmented from before; able to see a bigger
picture full of invasive technical excesses and legal abuses...
A second former official said NSA workers are polishing up their
rÃ©sumÃ©s and asking that they be cleared â removing any material linked
to classified programs â so they can be sent out to potential
employers. He noted that one employee who processes the rÃ©sumÃ©s said,
âIâve never seen so many rÃ©sumÃ©s that people want to have cleared in
my life.â
it remains to be seen if they simply jump to private sector who are
just as bad, or pursue less offensive careers entirely.
NSA morale down after Edward Snowden revelations, former U.S. officials say
By Ellen Nakashima, Published: December 7
Morale has taken a hit at the National Security Agency in the wake of
controversy over the agencyâs surveillance activities, according to
former officials who say they are dismayed that President Obama has
not visited the agency to show his support.
A White House spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, noted that top White House
officials have been to the agency to âexpress the presidentâs support
and appreciation for all that NSA does to keep us safe.â
It is not clear whether or when Obama might travel the 23 miles up the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway to visit Fort Meade, the NSAâs
headquarters in Maryland, but agency employees are privately voicing
frustration at what they perceive as White House ambivalence amid the
pounding the agency has taken from critics.
An NSA spokeswoman had no comment.
Obama in June defended the NSAâs surveillance as lawful and said he
welcomed the public debate prompted by revelations from former
contractor Edward Snowden beginning that month.
Though Obama has asserted, for instance, that the NSAâs collection of
virtually all Americansâ phone records is lawful and has saved lives,
the administration has not endorsed legislation that would codify it.
And his recent statements suggest he thinks some of the NSAâs
activities should be constrained.
A senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on
the record said that the White House would normally not endorse
legislation so early in the process but that âitâs been clear .â.â.
that we prefer legislationâ that preserves the phone records program
âwhile making some changes .â.â. to potentially strengthen oversight
and transparency.â
Said Hayden: âThe president has the highest respect for and pride in
the men and women of the intelligence community who work tirelessly to
protect our nation. Heâs expressed that directly to NSAâs leadership
and has praised their work in public. As he said: âThe men and women
of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe
because they love this country and believe in our values. Theyâre
She noted that in recent weeks, Lisa Monaco, assistant to the
president for homeland security and counterterrorism, and Denis
McDonough, the White House chief of staff, visited Fort Meade âto
express the presidentâs support and appreciation for all that NSA does
to keep us safe.ââ
Supporters of the NSA say staffers are not feeling the love.
âThe agency, from top to bottom, leadership to rank and file, feels
that it is had no support from the White House even though itâs been
carrying out publicly approved intelligence missions,â said Joel
Brenner, NSA inspector general from 2002 to 2006. âThey feel theyâve
been hung out to dry, and theyâre right.â
A former U.S. official â who like several other former officials
interviewed for this story requested anonymity because he still has
dealings with the agency â said: âThe president has multiple
constituencies â I get it. But he must agree that the signals
intelligence NSA is providing is one of the most important sources of
intelligence today.
âSo if thatâs the case, why isnât the president taking care of one of
the most important elements of the national security apparatus?â
The White House, observers say, is caught between competing desires to
preserve what it has said are valuable national security programs and
to shield the president from criticism from allies abroad and
civil-liberties advocates at home.
Some observers said it is not surprising that Obama would not travel
to Fort Meade before internal and external reviews of surveillance
activities have been completed. The reviews are expected to be done
The NSAâs director, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is retiring in the
spring after 81 / 2 years, has been the most vocal defender of the
agencyâs 35,000 employees. In speeches he has noted that more than
6,000 of them went to Iraq and Afghanistan to support the military. He
has spoken of how 22 cryptologists were killed. âTheyâre the heroes â
not the media leaker,â he said in a September speech, in a reference
to Snowden.
NSA counterterrorism analysts have worked âevery weekend for eight
years since Iâve been here. .â.â. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days
a week, theyâre there to defend us,â he said then.
On Thursday, Obama said on MSNBC that he would be proposing âsome
self-restraint on the NSAâ and âsome reforms that can give people more
In an interview with NBC last month, he said: âIn some ways, the
technology and the budgets and the capacity [at NSA] have outstripped
the constraints. And weâve got to rebuild those in the same way that
weâre having to do on a whole series of capacities .â.â. [such as]
drone operations.â
Civil-liberties advocates generally agree with that sentiment, but
they would go further and say that the NSAâs bulk collection of
domestic phone records is unlawful and ought to be ended.
Former officials note how President George W. Bush paid a visit to the
NSA in January 2006, in the wake of revelations by the New York Times
that the agency engaged in a counterterrorism program of warrantless
surveillance on U.S. soil beginning after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. âBush came out and spoke to the workforce, and the
effect on morale was tremendous,â Brenner said. âThereâs been nothing
like that from this White House.â
A second former official said NSA workers are polishing up their
rÃ©sumÃ©s and asking that they be cleared â removing any material linked
to classified programs â so they can be sent out to potential
employers. He noted that one employee who processes the rÃ©sumÃ©s said,
âIâve never seen so many rÃ©sumÃ©s that people want to have cleared in
my life.â
Morale is âbad overall,â a third former official said. âThe news â the
Snowden disclosures â it questions the integrity of the NSA
workforce,â he said. âItâs become very public and very personal.
Literally, neighbors are asking people, âWhy are you spying on
Grandma?â And we arenât. People are feeling bad, beaten down.â

@_subject: Re: Android IMSI Catcher detection 
see also this section on the OPEC hacks:
Heres how the NSA and GCHQ go after an organization like OPEC step by
step, based on an analysis of the NSA and GCHQ documents exposed by
Step 1: Identify. Using the NSA-built packet capture and inspection
system called TURMOIL, the agencies filter through Internet traffic at
a network choke point looking for specific "fingerprints" in traffic
that identify users with the organization being targeted. Data from
TURMOIL gets pulled into a number of traffic analysis tools, such as
XKeyscore and TRAFFICTHIEF, which do different sorts of packet
XKeyscore is the NSA's distributed search engine, catching a large
chunk of international Internet traffic for analysis. It helps find
things deep in the clutter of the Internet that analysts might miss by
allowing them to use search terms to find things in both live and
cached Internet traffic.
TRAFFICTHIEF, on the other hand, is much more focused. It filters for
very "strong" indicators, like known sets of IP addresses, addresses
within e-mail traffic, or user names in logins to social networks or
other services. It provides less depth of analysis than XKeyscore, but
it can handle much larger loads of data because it is more selective
about what it processes.
Together, the tools can be used to identify the systems used by an
individual or organization, including ranges of addresses that they
may use from work or home.
Step 2: Target. Using the profiles built using the surveillance tools,
the agencies can then identify potential points of attack. XKeyscore,
for example, can be used to search for patterns that identify known
security vulnerabilities within a range of addresses. Web visit
histories, e-mail traffic, and other data are analyzed looking for the
most likely (and least detectable) approach to gain access, and a
specific attack plan is crafted, including the identification of where
to launch the attack from.
At the NSA, this sort of thing is the work of Tailored Access
Operations. In the case of OPEC, the targeting process apparently went
on for several years as the NSA sought openings for an attack.
Step 3: Attack. Depending on who the target is, the NSA and GCHQ have
a variety of options. The least costly is to use access provided by
one of the intelligence agencies' telecommunications "partners" who
own network equipment at an exchange or other choke point that the
target's Internet traffic passes through. The agency running the
attack can use that access to introduce changes to Internet routing
tables that detour the targeted individual's traffic. But in some
cases, the NSA and GCHQ may have to perform "unilateral" taps on
network backbones to gain that level of accesstargeting a piece of
network hardware to take over or splicing directly into the target's
own connection to the Internet.
It's not clear which attack the NSA used to gain access to OPEC's
systems, though the GCHQ used a Quantum attack two years later to gain
its own very special access to the cartel's network. In the case of
the Belgacom hack, the GCHQ used a Quantum insert attackrouting the
Web requests for LinkedIn and Slashdot from the engineer being
targeted to a server posing as those sites. The NSA has used the same
approach to intercept traffic to sites such as Google.
The man-in-the-middle server can present content from the actual sites
the target intended to visit, but it can also add content to the
traffic, using what's called packet injectionmodifying the contents
of the data as it passes throughand intercept the user's credentials.
And by using a forged certificate, the NSA can intercept encrypted
traffic intended for the destination site.
Once the user has connected to the fake server, the intelligence
agencies can use the connection to launch attacks against the target's
Web browser to install monitoring software or other malware, using
similar techniques to those used by hackers. They can also use
credentials exposed via the man-in-the-middle attack to gain access to
other accounts owned by the target and to troll through connections in
those services that might be potential targets.
Step 4: Exploit. Once the target's computer has been successfully
attacked, the effort begins to look much like that of the Chinese
cyber warriors' attack of the New York Times or what cyber criminals
typically do when they score access to high-value targets. The
agencies' hackers work to stealthily expand their level of access,
using customized remote administration tools to grab user privileges
and gain access to other network resourcesmail servers, file servers,
and other network systems. They then start to "exfiltrate" data from
these systems and deliver them to analysts.

the partnership with NGA to deploy them gives a hint: this is putting
USRPs up close and personal to target for exploitation.
(the USRP's are definitely more portable than my favorite SDR, the Noctar[0]!)
given the obtained bits mentioned (WLLids, DSL accounts, Cookies,
GooglePREFIDs) gathered and then handed off to TAO for further QUANTUM
INSERT fucking of target systems it is likely they are doing GSM/cell
MitM to observe identifiers, along with WiFi attacks, and other egress
rather than deploying baseband exploits or deep active attacks
directly against the devices or other networks they're communicating
thus CNE in this case is cell MitM/WiFi pwn with a USRP rogue tower to
get identifiers for TAO.  and TAO is where they get dirty with "remote
exploitation" of the device itself and other targets on networks it
we've seen how they have a smorgasbord of weaponized exploits to cover
the gamut of target hardware and technical acumen in the QUANTUM
INSERT / TURMOIL / TRAFFICTHIEF / MUTANT BROTH / etc, etc. style
efforts.  it appears they're using this same infrastructure where
possible for mobile; restricting CNE on the ground only to target.

I have to take back my criticism of Intel's RNG.  I got my sims
working for a version of their architecture in .35u CMOS, and it's
simply better than my "Infinite Noise Multiplier".  It's probably the
best true random noise generator ever.  I still don't like how their
schematic is seems highly sensitive to supply noise, but we don't know
what the actual circuit looks like.  Intel hasn't told us.
So, I'm going to modify it a bit to use the resistors available on my
chip and reduce the caps, fix the supply sensitivity, and I think I
can run 16 of these things in parallel at 100-200MHz on the tiny .35u
CMOS chip I'm designing.  I'll spit out the raw waveforms from the
inverters, buffered once, through 16 "analog" pins, so there wont be
any fear (hopefully) that I'm cooking the data on-chip, before you can
see it, and I'll open-source the schematics.  If there's a circuit
that can consume all 1.6Gbit/sec of this raw data, have fun with it!
On the digital side, I'll XOR bits together to get the bandwidth down
to something reasonable, which I can send over USB, and provide a
simple Linux driver.
This thing will definitely put out RF, but since I'm making the raw
data available at the pins, should I care?  By the way, this is just a
for-fun project at work.  I get to do a free chip design :-)

I think there may be weaknesses in Intel's hardware RNG.  I took a
good look at Intel's hardware random number generator source. There's
a paper analyzing it here:
The basic idea is that back-to-back inverters, when powered on, flip
one way or the other randomly, sort of like DRAM memory when our
computer's power on.  By powering on a single pair of back-to-back
inverters over and over, they can generate a random bit per cycle, at
about 3 Giga-bits/second, which is amazing!  Here's my concerns about
the the paper:
- I saw no mathematical analysis of how much noise exists in the
system and how strongly it will influence the result each cycle. There
were generalities about how the noise could cause the output to be
random, but no numbers at all.
- There is an assumption that the capacitors are charged/discharged by
10% of the standard deviation of the noise.  I saw no justification
for this.  It seems they simply assumed best case.
- The paper is about as objective as a mother talking about her
children.  For example: "Overall, the Ivy Bridge RNG is a robust
design with a large margin of safety that ensures good random data is
generated even if the ES is not operating as well as predicted." Based
on what?
- I am not convinced they have the right model for the entropy source.
 They add noise to the bias on the capacitors, and compare that to 0
to determine the next output bit in their model.  I think the main
source of noise may be the randomness in number of electrons
added/subtracted each cycle, and that the back-to-back inverters in
the absence of other noise may be acting almost as an ideal
comparator.  However, if this were the case, even if there were 10%
noise in the number of electrons, there would be considerable
correlation between bits.
I also have questions about the design itself.  My main concern is
that noise on the VDD rail could easily determine the output.  For
example, if the transistors are mismatched, which of course they will
be, and the bias is set exactly right on the caps so there's a 50-50
chance of a 0 or 1, and suddenly VDD drops 10% due to a rising edge of
the the main system clock, then the inverter with higher gate
thresholds will become weak faster than the other one, thus
determining which one wins.  Since this circuit runs asynchronously
from the main system clock, I could easily see the 3MHz system clock
phase relative to the entropy generator clock determining most of the
results from the entropy source, while looking fairly random. Any
weakness in the raw random data stream is hidden from us by the AES
encryption done as a post-process.
I simulated back-to-back inverters in my .35u low power CMOS process
in SPICE to see if I could figure out how to make a practical circuit
using Intel's topology.  If it works, it would be fantastic.  I think
I can get rid of most of the supply noise issues.  I had a similar
problem in my "Infinite Noise Multiplier", so I switched to powering
the circuit with nothing but large W and L constant current sources,
and using the range from 0V to Vref, rather than 0V to VDD, because
Vref is stable relative to AVSS. However, I wasn't able to get enough
noise to make Intel's ciruit work, though that may be due to
limitations in the SPICE simulator.
Has anyone else had success using Intel's RNG topology?

on a more serious note, regarding the assumption:

NSA has stated that many of their BULLRUN techniques are incredibly
fragile.  a number of them now burned in leaks, many yet to get
stuffed. if they "did it risky"[0], perhaps feeling emboldened by the
seeming success of Dual_EC_DRBG and friends, a common key / reduction
hidden behind AES-128 rounds could be discovered, independently
confirmed, and properly attributed.
so not only can the backdoors be broken up, replacements which are
resistant to compromise will take their stead.  "everything" becomes
"much" becomes "very little" until ideally such invasive tactics are
reserved for HUMINT tasked "good ol'e detective work" with legal

an interesting read on the state of things.
Wyden does Oregon proud,
[only excerpted, whole thing is huge. waiting for cryptome to mirror... ]
Wyden estimates that he gets about fifteen minutes a year to ask
questions of top intelligence officials at open hearings. With the
help of his intelligence staffer, John Dickas, a thirty-five-year-old
from Beaverton, Oregon, whom Wyden calls the hero of the
intelligence-reform movement, Wyden often spends weeks preparing his
questions. He and Dickas look for opportunities to interrogate
officials on the gaps between what they say in public and what they
say in classified briefings. At a technology conference in Nevada the
previous summer, General Keith Alexander, the director of the N.S.A.,
had said that the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions
of dossiers on people is absolutely false. Wyden told me recently,
It sure didnt sound like the world I heard about in private. For
months, he tried to get a clarification from the N.S.A. about exactly
what Alexander had meant. Now he had the opportunity to ask Clapper in
public. As a courtesy, he had sent him the question the day before.
Wyden leaned forward and read Alexanders comment. Then he asked,
What I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to
the question Does the N.S.A. collect any type of data at all on
millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? 
Clapper slouched in his chair. He touched the fingertips of his right
hand to his forehead and made a fist with his left hand.
No, sir, he said. He gave a quick shake of his head and looked down
at the table.
It does not? Wyden asked, with exaggerated surprise.
Not wittingly, Clapper replied. He started scratching his forehead
and looked away from Wyden. There are cases where they could
inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.
Wyden told me, The answer was obviously misleading, false.

Towards Efficient Traffic-analysis Resistant Anonymity Networks
Stevens LeBlond, David Choffnes, Wenxuan Zhou, Peter Druschel, Hitesh
Ballani, and Paul Francis
August 2013
Existing IP anonymity systems tend to sacrifice one of low latency,
high bandwidth, or resistance to traffic-analysis. High-latency
mix-nets like Mixminion batch messages to resist traffic-analysis at
the expense of low latency. Onion routing schemes like Tor deliver low
latency and high bandwidth, but are not designed to withstand traffic
analysis. Designs based on DC-nets or broadcast channels resist
traffic analysis and provide low latency, but are limited to low
bandwidth communication.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
of Aqua, a high bandwidth anonymity system that resists traffic
analysis. We focus on providing strong anonymity for BitTorrent, and
evaluate the performance of Aqua using traces from hundreds of
thousands of actual Bit-Torrent users. We show that Aqua achieves
latency low enough for efficient bulk TCP flows, bandwidth sufficient
to carry BitTorrent traffic with reasonable efficiency, and resistance
to traffic analysis within anonymity sets of hundreds of clients. We
conclude that Aqua represents an interesting new point in the space of
anonymity network designs.

the NSA and others have great success around Tor by opportunistically
watching users fuck up (see other usability thread), by pwning their
horribly insecure systems (0days as far as the eye can see..), and by
actively manipulating user paths to the Tor network or destination
"forget your global passive adversary threats, active denial and
manipulation of service attacks are _really_ scary!"
said another way, breaking Tor at protocol level is currently too
expensive a solution to the same ends provided by much cheaper means.

as per the FreeBSD announcement[0] and others[1][2] direct use of
RDRAND as sole entropy source is not recommended.
from Westmere onward you could use AES-NI to make crypto fast in
OpenSSL.  a common theme is to initialize OpenSSL via
ENGINE_load_builtin_engines() which lets OpenSSL take advantage of
this acceleration.
with Sandy Bridge you also got RDRAND. now load_builtin_engines
results in the application using RDRAND directly for all entropy, in
addition to accelerating AES.
if you are using an application linked with openssl-1.0.1-beta1
through openssl-1.0.1e you should do one of the following:
a.) rebuild your OpenSSL with OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND defined.
b.) call RAND_set_rand_engine(NULL) after ENGINE_load_builtin_engines().
c.) git pull latest openssl with commit: "Don't use rdrand engine as
default unless explicitly requested." - Dr. Stephen Henson
the OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND option is recommended; an inadvertent call to
load engines elsewhere could re-enable this bad rng behavior.

decentralized search (not just not-corporate search) persists as one
of the great
practical challenges in peer to peer networking.
i have more to say later, but one effort from back in early 2000 is alpine:
   inside the 2004 snapshot there is also docs and implementation of
feedbackfs which is used to gather implicit feedback on recommendation
alpine is explicitly highly connected, flatter than not network
topology to improve robustness in the face of failure and active
attacks, and to avoid limitations inherent in many connection oriented
operating system facilities/sockets.
i am not quite an impartial party ;)
 but other approaches which are not a feasible replacement include:
 - the old skewl (mostly)flooding broadcasts like gnutella
 - fragile, hard to defend constructs like DHTs as keyword indexes
 - aggressive caching with local search (110% useful, but not sufficient alone)
 - distributed (but better somehow) search engines on darknets, etc.
these are more about search privacy or deep search more than
decentralized search.
the longer discussion is how to make decentralized search useful.
"Google style" search has a terrific performance advantage over
decentralized designs by brute force.
however, take advantage of massive endpoint / peer processing and
resources combined with implicit observational metrics for reputation
and recommendation, inside a well integrated framework for resource
discovery in usable software, and you have something more robust and
more effective than "Google style" could ever provide.
this is quite the trick, however!  despite an inter-operable component
model interface, and dynamic runtime module support to extend
discovery and wire protocol extensions, and other intentional efforts
at encouraging adoption and integration, alpine failed to bootstrap.

so sad/funny. a screw amuck, replacement drive significantly different

yanked for offline attack)
in a round about manner this was all instigated in part by wifi
research done at the time which put various powerful entities into a
tiff.  here's what the pacNW sample looked like back in early 2003:
"Cleartext Nodes: 8755 (62.59%)
  , WEP Nodes: 5232 (37.40%)"

vulnerable router/CPE, and present a sufficiently compelling target,
you may encounter a clever "just outside the property line" isolation
and active attack on DOCSIS uplink. (a broadcast medium is hard to

@_subject: Fwd: [Dailydave] Understanding BIOS & SMM 
Our research team at MITRE has been looking into BIOS security for the
past couple years and starting to publish our results in the last
year. We described BIOS exploits and an in-BIOS defensive system
called BIOS Chronomancy at venues like BlackHat and ACM CCS. We also
released a free tool called Copernicus[1] which lets you detect if a
BIOS is writable, and dump the contents of the BIOS from a Windows
system (which makes enterprise-wide configuration and integrity
checking possible.)
But the question is, let's say you have a BIOS dump and it shows
differences. How are you going to interpret those differences? How do
you distinguish natural changes from malicious ones? We wanted to get
a basic inspection capability out there, but we recognized that people
were going to need to know a lot more about system internals, hardware
quirks, and UEFI before they'd be able to make full use of it. So we
made a class to help bootstrap people faster. Currently the class is
scheduled for CanSecWest[2] and Syscan[3] (and the prices are going up
starting Feb 1).
It would be nice if people wanted to understand how the deep system
architecture worked for it's own sake, because we of course think it's
super interesting and fulfilling to know things others don't. But
hopefully the news of the past couple months has made people realize
that "out of sight, out of mind" isn't a great strategy for BIOS
security. First there was  (which was kicked off by Dragos
experimenting with Copernicus[4]). Then there was NSA's defensive side
saying they had caught the Chinese making BIOS bricking attacks[5].
Then there was NSA's offensive side being caught having their own BIOS
backdoor capabilities[6]. And of course there were a whole lot of
people letting their FUD flags fly around all of it.
So if you'd like to get a more technical and quantitative view of what
the BIOS/SMM security landscape looks like, you should check out our
classes and watch for talks by Corey Kallenberg, John Butterworth, and
myself over the next 6 months where we'll be describing 2 new BIOS
memory-corruption-to-reflash exploits, 2 new SecureBoot-breaking
tricks, and trustworthy computing extensions to Copernicus that will
counter many classes of attacks against BIOS dumping software that
would let an attacker hide his BIOS presence.

entropy right.
in 2008 various "expert install" console only options began to support
a suitable FDE solution with luks and boot by volume GUID (rather than
device file).
many years we've had full blown easy (for some degree of easy) FDE
solutions in graphical installers out of the gate. progress!
and yet entropy, the most critical component of any crypto system, is
so horribly and woefully inadequate today. will no indications this
will change soon...
this is not an accident.  :/
yup.  for fun, check out how this setup seeds itself:
srand() and rand() from stdlib (64 bits)
gettid() or pthread_self() (32 bits)
getpid() (32 bits)
Linux-type systems are a little strange in that /dev/random only keeps
about 20 bytes of entropy in reserve. And it takes roughly 20 seconds
for a VPS to collect 8 bytes of entropy, which means asking for 32
bytes of entropy takes an unreasonably long time. By asking for only
20 bytes, most of the requests by this library will complete
immediately. And the remaining 12 bytes are satisfied by
amazingly effective!  BULLRUN FTW

physical entropy sources as native instructions in processors.  this
should be a baseline mandatory requirement!  i am also lamenting the
lack of user space entropy daemons and collectors being enabled by
default in most distributions.  i am also lamenting the lack of proper
boot time / VM pass through entropy support in most distributions.  i
am lamenting the lack of any failure handling for entropy in any
distribution, such that a failed RNG condition leads to service halt
rather than blindly carrying on, perhaps for years, unaware that
you're broken. i am also lamenting the lack of serious attention and
thoroughness applied to entropy sources in nearly every computing

i should have better clarified intent:
- long term keys are offline, otherwise better protected (for
arbitrary degrees of "beyond the everyday level").  thwarting active
attacks or chosen input attacks is explicitly intended.
- long term keys can be large, or slow, or demand elevated protections
and blinding, or other mechanisms which aggravate to point of
disabling or calling to costly with respect to the working / short
term keys.  applying all reasonable protections is specifically
- long term keys may be M of N threshold schemes for group or ceremony
based attestations for other long term keys, working keys, or secure
identifiers in general.  said another way, long term keys are
specifically intended as trust anchors in public key systems of
various types.

@_subject: Fwd: [liberationtech] 15 years later, why can Johnny still not encrypt? 
As one anecdote, when I TAed the MIT Network and Computer security
course, we assigned "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt" as the first reading.
We asked the students to send us a PGP encrypted & signed message and
tell us how long it took.
If I recall correctly, it took an average of 30 minutes for
non-existing users to figure out how to use PGP. Think about that.
These were graduate & upperclass undergraduate computer science
students enrolled in a network security course. Everyone had accounts
on the same university system and were mostly using standalone email
Best of all, someone decided it would be funny to generate a fake key
for me and post it to pgp.mit.edu. Several students fell for the
trick, didn't verify the key, and encrypted their homework with the
wrong key. It was a great way to drive home the lesson, but we asked
the jokers to kindly revoke their key, which they did.
Long story short, PGP was still hard to figure out for an experienced
cohort of users, who didn't have the issues of webmail and
proliferation of mobile platforms we have today. I don't think
anything has improved to make it viable for a wider audience.

     How the NSA Threatens National Security
Secret NSA eavesdropping is still in the news. Details about once
secret programs continue to leak. The Director of National
Intelligence has recently declassified additional information, and the
President's Review Group has just released its report and
With all this going on, it's easy to become inured to the breadth and
depth of the NSA's activities. But through the disclosures, we've
learned an enormous amount about the agency's capabilities, how it is
failing to protect us, and what we need to do to regain security in
the Information Age.
First and foremost, the surveillance state is robust. It is robust
politically, legally, and technically. I can name three different NSA
programs to collect Gmail user data. These programs are based on three
different technical eavesdropping capabilities. They rely on three
different legal authorities. They involve collaborations with three
different companies. And this is just Gmail. The same is true for cell
phone call records, Internet chats, cell-phone location data.
Second, the NSA continues to lie about its capabilities. It hides
behind tortured interpretations of words like "collect,"
"incidentally," "target," and "directed." It cloaks programs in
multiple code names to obscure their full extent and capabilities.
Officials testify that a particular surveillance activity is not done
under one particular program or authority, conveniently omitting that
it is done under some other program or authority.
Third, US government surveillance is not just about the NSA. The
Snowden documents have given us extraordinary details about the NSA's
activities, but we now know that the CIA, NRO, FBI, DEA, and local
police all engage in ubiquitous surveillance using the same sorts of
eavesdropping tools, and that they regularly share information with
each other.
The NSA's collect-everything mentality is largely a hold-over from the
Cold War, when a voyeuristic interest in the Soviet Union was the
norm. Still, it is unclear how effective targeted surveillance against
"enemy" countries really is. Even when we learn actual secrets, as we
did regarding Syria's use of chemical weapons earlier this year, we
often can't do anything with the information.
Ubiquitous surveillance should have died with the fall of Communism,
but it got a new -- and even more dangerous -- life with the
intelligence community's post-9/11 "never again" terrorism mission.
This quixotic goal of preventing something from happening forces us to
try to know everything that does happen. This pushes the NSA to
eavesdrop on online gaming worlds and on every cell phone in the
world. But it's a fool's errand; there are simply too many ways to
We have no evidence that any of this surveillance makes us safer. NSA
Director General Keith Alexander responded to these stories in June by
claiming that he disrupted 54 terrorist plots. In October, he revised
that number downward to 13, and then to "one or two." At this point,
the only "plot" prevented was that of a San Diego man sending $8,500
to support a Somali militant group. We have been repeatedly told that
these surveillance programs would have been able to stop 9/11, yet the
NSA didn't detect the Boston bombings -- even though one of the two
terrorists was on the watch list and the other had a sloppy social
media trail. Bulk collection of data and metadata is an ineffective
counterterrorism tool.
Not only is ubiquitous surveillance ineffective, it is extraordinarily
costly. I don't mean just the budgets, which will continue to
skyrocket. Or the diplomatic costs, as country after country learns of
our surveillance programs against their citizens. I'm also talking
about the cost to our society. It breaks so much of what our society
has built. It breaks our political systems, as Congress is unable to
provide any meaningful oversight and citizens are kept in the dark
about what government does. It breaks our legal systems, as laws are
ignored or reinterpreted, and people are unable to challenge
government actions in court. It breaks our commercial systems, as US
computer products and services are no longer trusted worldwide. It
breaks our technical systems, as the very protocols of the Internet
become untrusted. And it breaks our social systems; the loss of
privacy, freedom, and liberty is much more damaging to our society
than the occasional act of random violence.
And finally, these systems are susceptible to abuse. This is not just
a hypothetical problem. Recent history illustrates many episodes where
this information was, or would have been, abused: Hoover and his FBI
spying, McCarthy, Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights
movement, anti-war Vietnam protesters, and -- more recently -- the
Occupy movement. Outside the US, there are even more extreme examples.
Building the surveillance state makes it too easy for people and
organizations to slip over the line into abuse.
It's not just domestic abuse we have to worry about; it's the rest of
the world, too. The more we choose to eavesdrop on the Internet and
other communications technologies, the less we are secure from
eavesdropping by others. Our choice isn't between a digital world
where the NSA can eavesdrop and one where the NSA is prevented from
eavesdropping; it's between a digital world that is vulnerable to all
attackers, and one that is secure for all users.
Fixing this problem is going to be hard. We are long past the point
where simple legal interventions can help. The bill in Congress to
limit NSA surveillance won't actually do much to limit NSA
surveillance. Maybe the NSA will figure out an interpretation of the
law that will allow it to do what it wants anyway. Maybe it'll do it
another way, using another justification. Maybe the FBI will do it and
give it a copy. And when asked, it'll lie about it.
NSA-level surveillance is like the Maginot Line was in the years
before World War II: ineffective and wasteful. We need to openly
disclose what surveillance we have been doing, and the known
insecurities that make it possible. We need to work toward security,
even if other countries like China continue to use the Internet as a
giant surveillance platform. We need to build a coalition of
free-world nations dedicated to a secure global Internet, and we need
to continually push back against bad actors -- both state and
non-state -- that work against that goal.
Securing the Internet requires both laws and technology. It requires
Internet technology that secures data wherever it is and however it
travels. It requires broad laws that put security ahead of both
domestic and international surveillance. It requires additional
technology to enforce those laws, and a worldwide enforcement regime
to deal with bad actors. It's not easy, and has all the problems that
other international issues have: nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapon non-proliferation; small arms trafficking; human trafficking;
money laundering; intellectual property. Global information security
and anti-surveillance needs to join those difficult global problems,
so we can start making progress.
The President's Review Group recommendations are largely positive, but
they don't go nearly far enough. We need to recognize that security is
more important than surveillance, and work towards that goal.

     NSA Exploit of the Day
One of the top secret NSA documents published by Der Spiegel is a
50-page catalog of "implants" from the NSA's Tailored Access Group.
Because the individual implants are so varied and we saw so many at
once, most of them were never discussed in the security community.
(Also, the pages were images, which makes them harder to index and
search.)  To rectify this, I am publishing an exploit a day on my
In the blog comments, feel free to discuss how the exploit works, how
we might detect it, how it has probably been improved since the
catalog entry in 2008, and so on.
"DEITYBOUNCE provides software application persistence on Dell
PowerEdge servers by exploiting the motherboard BIOS and utilizing
System Management Mode (SMM) to gain periodic execution while the
Operating System loads."
"IRONCHEF provides access persistence to target systems by exploiting
the motherboard BIOS and utilizing System  Management Mode (SMM) to
communicate with a hardware implany that provides two-way RF
communication."  It works on the HP Proliant 380DL G5 server.
"FEEDTROUGH is a persistence technique for two software implants,
DNT's BANANAGLEE and CES's ZESTYLEAK used against Juniper Netscreen
"GOURMETTROUGH is a user configurable implant for certain Juniper
firewalls. It persists DNT's BANANAGLEE implant across reboots and OS
upgrades. For some platforms, it supports a minimal implant with
beaconing for OS's unsupported by BANANAGLEE."
"The HALLUXWATER Persistence Back Door implant is installed on a
target Huawei Eudemon firewall as a boot ROM upgrade. When the target
reboots, the PBD installer software will find the needed patch points
and install the back door in the inbound packet processing routine."
"JETPLOW is a firmware persistence implant for Cisco PIX Series and
ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls. It persists DNT's
BANANAGLEE software implant. JETPLOW also has a persistent back-door
"SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for Juniper SSG 500 and
SSG 300 firewalls. It persists DNT's BANANAGLEE software implant.
SOUFFLETROUGH also has an advanced persistent back-door capability."
"HEADWATER is a Persistent Backdoor (PDB) software implant for
selected Huawei routers. The implant will enable covert functions to
be remotely executed within the router via an Internet connection."
"SCHOOLMONTANA provides persistence for DNT implants. The DNT implant
will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating system --
including physically replacing the router's compact flash card."
A U.S. government employee e-mailed me, asking me not to post these on
my blog.  The government has a weird policy that exposed secrets are
still secret, and government employees without clearances are
prohibited from reading the classified paragraphs.  I've heard this
before. Basically, before exposure only people with a TOP SECRET
clearance could read these paragraphs.  After exposure, only people
without any clearance at all can read these paragraphs.  No, it
doesn't make any sense.

     Tor User Identified by FBI
Eldo Kim sent an e-mail bomb threat to Harvard so he could skip a
final exam.  (It's just a coincidence that I was on the Harvard campus
that day.)  Even though he used an anonymous account and Tor, the FBI
identified him. Reading the criminal complaint, it seems that the FBI
got itself a list of Harvard users that accessed the Tor network, and
went through them one by one to find the one who sent the threat.
This is one of the problems of using a rare security tool.  The very
thing that gives you plausible deniability also makes you the most
likely suspect.  The FBI didn't have to break Tor; they just used
conventional police mechanisms to get Kim to confess.
Tor didn't break; Kim did.

     News
This story is about how at least two professional online poker players
had their hotel rooms broken into and their computers infected with
malware.  I agree with the conclusion: "So, what's the moral of the
story? If you have a laptop that is used to move large amounts of
money, take good care of it. Lock the keyboard when you step away. Put
it in a safe when you're not around it, and encrypt the disk to
prevent off-line access. Don't surf the web with it (use another
laptop/device for that, they're relatively cheap). This advice is true
whether you're a poker pro using a laptop for gaming or a business
controller in a large company using the computer for wiring a large
amount of funds."  Cheap laptops are very cheap, especially if you buy
old models off the remainder tables at big box stores.  There's no
reason not to have special purpose machines.
An interesting research paper documents a "honeymoon effect" when it
comes to software and vulnerabilities: attackers are more likely to
find vulnerabilities in older and more familiar code.  It's a few
years old, but I haven't seen it before now. The paper is by Sandy
Clark, Stefan Frei, Matt Blaze, and Jonathan Smith: "Familiarity

Two long blog posts on the NSA.  The first is about RSA entering into
a secret agreement with the NSA to make the backdoored DUAL_EC_PRNG

The second is about the NSA Tailored Access Operations (TAO) group and
their capabilities, based on new NSA top secret documents released by
Der Spiegel.  Jacob Appelbaum did a great job reporting on this stuff.

Joseph Stiglitz has an excellent essay on the value of trust, and the
lack of it in today's society.
It has amazed me that the NSA doesn't seem to do any cost/benefit
analyses on any of its surveillance programs.  This seems particularly
important for bulk surveillance programs, as they have significant
costs aside from the obvious monetary costs.  In this paper, John
Mueller and Mark G. Stewart have done the analysis on one of these
programs.  Worth reading.

is better than bulk surveillance.
or This is important.  As scarily impressive as TAO's implant catalog is,
it's targeted.  We can argue about how it should be targeted -- who
counts as a "bad guy" and who doesn't -- but it's much better than the
NSA's collecting cell phone location data on everyone on the planet.
The more we can deny the NSA the ability to do broad wholesale
surveillance on everyone, and force them to do targeted surveillance
in individuals and organizations, the safer we all are.

     Security Risks of Embedded Systems
We're at a crisis point now with regard to the security of embedded
systems, where computing is embedded into the hardware itself -- as
with the Internet of Things. These embedded computers are riddled with
vulnerabilities, and there's no good way to patch them.
It's not unlike what happened in the mid-1990s, when the insecurity of
personal computers was reaching crisis levels. Software and operating
systems were riddled with security vulnerabilities, and there was no
good way to patch them. Companies were trying to keep vulnerabilities
secret, and not releasing security updates quickly. And when updates
were released, it was hard -- if not impossible -- to get users to
install them. This has changed over the past twenty years, due to a
combination of full disclosure -- publishing vulnerabilities to force
companies to issue patches quicker -- and automatic updates:
automating the process of installing updates on users' computers. The
results aren't perfect, but they're much better than ever before.
But this time the problem is much worse, because the world is
different: All of these devices are connected to the Internet. The
computers in our routers and modems are much more powerful than the
PCs of the mid-1990s, and the Internet of Things will put computers
into all sorts of consumer devices. The industries producing these
devices are even less capable of fixing the problem than the PC and
software industries were.
If we don't solve this soon, we're in for a security disaster as
hackers figure out that it's easier to hack routers than computers. At
a recent Def Con, a researcher looked at thirty home routers and broke
into half of them -- including some of the most popular and common
To understand the problem, you need to understand the embedded systems market.
Typically, these systems are powered by specialized computer chips
made by companies such as Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Marvell. These chips
are cheap, and the profit margins slim. Aside from price, the way the
manufacturers differentiate themselves from each other is by features
and bandwidth. They typically put a version of the Linux operating
system onto the chips, as well as a bunch of other open-source and
proprietary components and drivers. They do as little engineering as
possible before shipping, and there's little incentive to update their
"board support package" until absolutely necessary.
The system manufacturers -- usually original device manufacturers
(ODMs) who often don't get their brand name on the finished product --
choose a chip based on price and features, and then build a router,
server, or whatever. They don't do a lot of engineering, either. The
brand-name company on the box may add a user interface and maybe some
new features, make sure everything works, and they're done, too.
The problem with this process is that no one entity has any incentive,
expertise, or even ability to patch the software once it's shipped.
The chip manufacturer is busy shipping the next version of the chip,
and the ODM is busy upgrading its product to work with this next chip.
Maintaining the older chips and products just isn't a priority.
And the software is old, even when the device is new. For example, one
survey of common home routers found that the software components were
four to five years older than the device. The minimum age of the Linux
operating system was four years. The minimum age of the Samba file
system software: six years. They may have had all the security patches
applied, but most likely not. No one has that job. Some of the
components are so old that they're no longer being patched. This
patching is especially important because security vulnerabilities are
found "more easily" as systems age.
To make matters worse, it's often impossible to patch the software or
upgrade the components to the latest version. Often, the complete
source code isn't available. Yes, they'll have the source code to
Linux and any other open-source components. But many of the device
drivers and other components are just "binary blobs" -- no source code
at all. That's the most pernicious part of the problem: No one can
possibly patch code that's just binary.
Even when a patch is possible, it's rarely applied. Users usually have
to manually download and install relevant patches. But since users
never get alerted about security updates, and don't have the expertise
to manually administer these devices, it doesn't happen. Sometimes the
ISPs have the ability to remotely patch routers and modems, but this
is also rare.
The result is hundreds of millions of devices that have been sitting
on the Internet, unpatched and insecure, for the last five to ten
Hackers are starting to notice. Malware DNS Changer attacks home
routers as well as computers. In Brazil, 4.5 million DSL routers were
compromised for purposes of financial fraud. Last month, Symantec
reported on a Linux worm that targets routers, cameras, and other
embedded devices.
This is only the beginning. All it will take is some easy-to-use
hacker tools for the script kiddies to get into the game.
And the Internet of Things will only make this problem worse, as the
Internet -- as well as our homes and bodies -- becomes flooded with
new embedded devices that will be equally poorly maintained and
unpatchable. But routers and modems pose a particular problem, because
they're: (1) between users and the Internet, so turning them off is
increasingly not an option; (2) more powerful and more general in
function than other embedded devices; (3) the one 24/7 computing
device in the house, and are a natural place for lots of new features.
We were here before with personal computers, and we fixed the problem.
But disclosing vulnerabilities in an effort to force vendors to fix
the problem won't work the same way as with embedded systems. The last
time, the problem was computers, ones mostly not connected to the
Internet, and slow-spreading viruses. The scale is different today:
more devices, more vulnerability, viruses spreading faster on the
Internet, and less technical expertise on both the vendor and the user
sides. Plus vulnerabilities that are impossible to patch.
Combine full function with lack of updates, add in a pernicious market
dynamic that has inhibited updates and prevented anyone else from
updating, and we have an incipient disaster in front of us. It's just
a matter of when.
We simply have to fix this. We have to put pressure on embedded system
vendors to design their systems better. We need open-source driver
software -- no more binary blobs! -- so third-party vendors and ISPs
can provide security tools and software updates for as long as the
device is in use. We need automatic update mechanisms to ensure they
get installed.
The economic incentives point to large ISPs as the driver for change.
Whether they're to blame or not, the ISPs are the ones who get the
service calls for crashes. They often have to send users new hardware
because it's the only way to update a router or modem, and that can
easily cost a year's worth of profit from that customer. This problem
is only going to get worse, and more expensive. Paying the cost up
front for better embedded systems is much cheaper than paying the
costs of the resultant security disasters.

     Schneier News
I left BT at the end of December.
Last month, Eben Moglen and I had a conversation about NSA
surveillance.  Audio and video are online.
or ** *** ***** ******* *********** *************
     Schneier News: I've Joined Co3 Systems
For decades, I've said that good security is a combination of
protection, detection, and response.  In 1999, when I formed
Counterpane Internet Security, I focused the company on what was then
the nascent area of detection.  Since then, there have been many
products and services that focus on detection, and it's a huge part of
the information security industry.  Now, it's time for response.
While there are many companies that offer services to aid in incident
response -- mitigation, forensics, recovery, compliance -- there are
no comprehensive products in this area.
Well, almost none.  Co3 Systems provides a coordination system for
incident response.  I think of it as a social networking site for
incident response, though the company doesn't use this term.  The idea
is that the system generates your incident response plan on
installation, and when something happens, automatically executes it.
It collects information about the incident, assigns and tracks tasks,
and logs everything you do.  It links you with information you might
need, companies you might want to talk to, and regulations you might
be required to comply with.  And it logs everything, so you can
demonstrate that you followed your response plan and thus the law --
or see how and where you fell short.
Years ago, attacks were both less frequent and less serious, and
compliance requirements were more modest. But today, companies get
breached all the time, and regulatory requirements are complicated --
and getting more so all the time.  Ad hoc incident response isn't
enough anymore.  There are lots of things you need to do when you're
attacked, both to secure your network from the attackers and to secure
your company from litigation.
The problem with any emergency response plan is that you only need it
in an emergency.  Emergencies are both complicated and stressful, and
it's easy for things to fall through the cracks.  It's critical to
have something -- a system, a checklist, even a person -- that tracks
everything and makes sure that everything that has to get done is.
Co3 Systems is great in an emergency, but of course you really want to
have installed and configured it *before* the emergency.
It will also serve you better if you use it regularly.  Co3 Systems is
designed to be valuable for all incident response, both the mundane
and the critical.  The system can record and assess everything that
appears abnormal.  The incident response plans it generates make it
easy, and the intelligence feeds make it useful.  If Co3 Systems is
already in place, when something turns out to be a real incident, it's
easy to escalate it to the next level, and you'll be using tools
you're already familiar with.
Co3 Systems works either from a private cloud or on your network.  I
think the cloud makes more sense; you don't want to coordinate
incident response from the network that is under attack.  And it's
constantly getting better as more partner companies integrate their
information feeds and best practices.  The company has launched some
of these partnerships already, and there are some major names soon to
be announced.
Today I am joining Co3 Systems as its Chief Technology Officer.  I've
been on the company's advisory board for about a year, and was an
informal adviser to CEO John Bruce before that.  John and I worked
together at Counterpane in the early 2000s, and we both think this is
a natural extension to what we tried to build there.  I also know CMO
Ted Julian from his days at   Together, we're going to build
*the* incident response product.
I'm really excited about this -- and the fact that the company
headquarters are just three T stops inbound to Harvard and the Berkman
Center makes it even more perfect.

Red-Team Networks Everywhere!!!
This effort attempts to remedy the pervasive and comprehensive
vulnerability of consumer, industry, and government hardware and
software systems.  In order to achieve best effective posture with
maximum haste apply four principles globally:
1) Blanket Legal Invulnerability
Remove all criminal and civil liability for "hacking", computer
trespass, and all related activities performed over data networks;
establish proactive "shield" legislation to protect and encourage
unrestricted security research of any subject on any network. extend
to international agreements for blanket protection in all
2) Educational Support Everywhere
Establish lock picking, computing, and hacking curriculum in pre
school through grade school with subsidized access to technical
resources including mobile, tablet, laptop test equipment, grid/cloud
computing on-demand, software defined radios with full
receive/transmit, and gigabit internet service or faster.
3) Collaborative Competitions
Organize a program of blue and red teaming challenges for educational
and public participation at the district, regional, and national level
cultivating expertise and rewarding it with hacking toys, access, and
4) Privileged Positioning
Direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or
groups who demonstrate competence in either the educational or
competitive realms, in order for them to mount additional attack
strategies against any reach-able target. this access must consist of
both passive taps of backbone traffic as well as injection taps for
raw packet transmission at core rates. this should be available on the
Internet backbone at internet exchanges, private fiber through public
right of way, and core networks of operators of licensed wireless
end result / strong attractor:
Open software and hardware widely in use in
post-privacy-protection-purge future will invert power structure to
defender with near unassailable advantage in "cyber domain".  Any
attacker required to compete against the global, collaborative,
massive, iterative-crowd-hardened systems publicly in use.

FFmpeg and a thousand fixes
Friday, January 10, 2014 9:06 AM
Posted by Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind, Information Security Engineers
At Google, security is a top priority - not only for our own products,
but across the entire Internet. Thats why members of the Google
Security Team and other Googlers frequently perform audits of software
and report the resulting findings to the respective vendors or
maintainers, as shown in the official Vulnerabilities - Application
Security list. We also try to employ the extensive computing power of
our data centers in order to solve some of the security challenges by
performing large-scale automated testing, commonly known as fuzzing.
One internal fuzzing effort we have been running continuously for the
past two years is the testing process of FFmpeg, a large
cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video
written in C. It is used in multiple applications and software
libraries such as Google Chrome, MPlayer, VLC or xine. We started
relatively small by making use of trivial mutation algorithms, some
500 cores and input media samples gathered from readily available
sources such as the samples.mplayerhq.hu sample base and FFmpeg FATE
regression testing suite. Later on, we grew to more complex and
effective mutation methods, 2000 cores and an input corpus supported
by sample files improving the overall code coverage.
Following more than two years of work, we are happy to announce that
the FFmpeg project has incorporated more than a thousand fixes to bugs
(including some security issues) that we have discovered in the
project so far:
$ git log | grep Jurczyk | grep -c Coldwind
... we have carried out several dozen fuzzing iterations (each
typically resulting in less crashes than the previous ones) over the
last two years, identifying bugs of a number of different classes:
NULL pointer dereferences,
Invalid pointer arithmetic leading to SIGSEGV due to unmapped memory access,
Out-of-bounds reads and writes to stack, heap and static-based arrays,
Invalid free() calls,
Double free() calls over the same pointer,
Division errors,
Assertion failures,
Use of uninitialized memory.
We have simultaneously worked with the developers of Libav, an
independent fork of FFmpeg, in order to have both projects represent
an equal, high level of robustness and security posture. Today, Libav
is at 413 fixes and the library is slowly but surely catching up with

@_subject: Fwd: [cryptography] ECC patent FUD revisited 
NSA's Kevin Igoe writes, on the semi-moderated cfrg list:
There are several interesting aspects to this patent FUD. Notice that
the FUD is being used to argue against switching to curves that improve
ECC security. Notice also the complete failure to specify any patent
numbers---so the FUD doesn't have any built-in expiration date, and
there's no easy way for the reader to investigate further.
 says that
Certicom "discovered and patented many fundamental innovations" and has
"more than 350 patents and patents pending worldwide". This sounds
impressive until you look at what the portfolio actually contains.
The reality is that Certicom has contributed essentially nothing to
state-of-the-art ECC. Its patent portfolio consists of a few fringe
ideas and a few obsolete ideas---nothing essential for mainstream ECC
usage. Nobody needs MQV, for example: traditional DH achieves the same
security goals in a much more straightforward way, and very few people
notice the marginal performance benefit provided by MQV.
The reason that Certicom has so many "patents and patents pending
worldwide", despite having contributed so few ideas, is that it keeps
splitting its patent applications. For example, the original MQV patent
filings in early 1995 ended up being split into an incredibly redundant
collection of US patents 5761305, 5889865, 5896455, 5933504, 6122736,
6487661, 7243232, 7334127, 7779259, 8090947, and 8209533, not to mention
the corresponding non-US patents CA2237688, DE69636815, EP0873617, etc.

you need to change the incentive to result in a privacy enhancing

i should have better clarified intent:
- long term keys are offline, otherwise better protected (for

- long term keys can be large, or slow, or demand elevated protections
and blinding, or other mechanisms which aggravate to point of
disabling or calling to costly with respect to the working / short
term keys.  applying all reasonable protections is specifically
- long term keys may be M of N threshold schemes for group or ceremony

identifiers in general.  said another way, long term keys are
specifically intended as trust anchors in public key systems of

0. "security by self evident existence"
Red-Team Networks Everywhere!!!
This effort attempts to remedy the pervasive and comprehensive
vulnerability of consumer, industry, and government hardware and
software systems.  In order to achieve best effective posture with
maximum haste apply four principles globally:
1) Blanket Legal Invulnerability
Remove all criminal and civil liability for "hacking", computer
trespass, and all related activities performed over data networks;
establish proactive "shield" legislation to protect and encourage
unrestricted security research of any subject on any network. extend
to international agreements for blanket protection in all
2) Educational Support Everywhere
Establish lock picking, computing, and hacking curriculum in pre
school through grade school with subsidized access to technical
resources including mobile, tablet, laptop test equipment, grid/cloud
computing on-demand, software defined radios with full
receive/transmit, and gigabit internet service or faster.
3) Collaborative Competitions
Organize a program of blue and red teaming challenges for educational
and public participation at the district, regional, and national level
cultivating expertise and rewarding it with hacking toys, access, and
4) Privileged Positioning
Direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or
groups who demonstrate competence in either the educational or
competitive realms, in order for them to mount additional attack
strategies against any reach-able target. this access must consist of
both passive taps of backbone traffic as well as injection taps for
raw packet transmission at core rates. this should be available on the
Internet backbone at internet exchanges, private fiber through public
right of way, and core networks of operators of licensed wireless
end result / strong attractor:
Open software and hardware widely in use in
post-privacy-protection-purge future will invert power structure to
defender with near unassailable advantage in "cyber domain".  Any
attacker required to compete against the global, collaborative,
massive, iterative-crowd-hardened systems publicly in use.

@_subject: Re: Omidyar influence in new Greenwald venture [was: SRF: cryptic] 
GG refutes this premise entirely, and with conviction:
(4) The claim that we are "holding back documents" for some nefarious
or self-interested purpose is and always has been false. I have
discussed many times before - most prominently here - why our
agreement with our source, along with related legal issues, prevents
any sort of mass release of documents, but I have been working
endlessly, as has Laura, to continue to publish stories all around the
world, including publishing many stories and documents after we formed
our new venture.
Not only have I published new documents in Norway, Sweden, France,
Spain, and Holland after we formed our new venture, but I also
published one of the most attention-generating stories yet in the
Huffington Post just five weeks ago. Similarly, Laura has published
numerous big articles and key NSA documents in both der Spiegel and
the NYT after we formed our new venture. We're doing the exact
opposite of this accusation: we're publishing documents and stories
aggressively all over the world with other media outlets until our
First Look site is ready.
We will continue to publish aggressively with other outlets until we
are up and running at First Look. In fact, I am working right now with
other news outlets, including in the U.S., on big stories. I'm not
"holding back" anything: of all the many entities with thousands of
Snowden documents, I have published more NSA documents, in more
nations around the world, than anyone. And there are many, many more
that will be published in the short-term.
But - and this is critical - in his Washington Post interview with
Snowden last month, Bart Gellman noted "Snowdens insistence, to this
reporter and others, that he does not want the documents published in
bulk." From the start, Snowden indeed repeatedly insisted on that.
Anyone who demands that we "release all documents" - or even release
large numbers in bulk - is demanding that we violate our agreement
with our source, disregard the framework we created when he gave us
the documents, jeopardize his interests in multiple ways, and subject
him to far greater legal (and other) dangers. I find that demand to be
unconscionable, and we will never, ever violate our agreement with him
no matter how many people want us to.
That said, we have published an extraordinary number of top secret NSA
documents around the world in a short period of time. And our work is
very far from done: there are many, many more documents and stories
that we will publish.
Toward that end, we have very carefully increased the number of
journalists and experts who are working on these documents and who
have access to them. We are now working with more experts in
cryptography and hacking than ever. One of the most exciting things
about our new organization is that we now have the resources to
process and report these documents more quickly and efficiently than
ever before, consistent with ensuring that we don't make the kinds of
errors that would allow others to attack the reporting.
These documents are complex. Sometimes they take a good deal of
reporting to fill in some of the gaps. From the start, people have
been eager for us to make serious mistakes so they can exploit them to
discredit the reporting, and so we work very hard to make sure that
doesn't happen. That takes time. Convincing media institutions (and
their armies of risk-averse lawyers, editors and executives) to
publish documents, the aggressive way we think they need to be
published, also often takes a lot of time.
When we began our reporting in June by publishing a new story every
day, even our allies - people who work on these issues for a living -
complained that the releases were coming too fast to process,
understand, or keep up with, and argued that each story needs time to
be processed and to allow people to react.
In terms of effects, I think it's hard to argue with the strategy.
Even seven months later, the story continues to dominate headlines
around the world and to trigger what Chelsea Manning described in her
private chat as her goal when whistleblowing: "worldwide discussion,
debates, and reforms". That's why Edward Snowden made clear to Bart
Gellman that he "succeeded beyond plausible ambition."
For the same reason, I'm proud that we're trying to amplify the
lessons and maximize the impact of these disclosures even more through
things like books and films, which can reach and affect audiences that
political reporting by itself never can. I've been working for many
years warning of the dangers of state surveillance and the value of
internet freedom and privacy, and am thrilled to now be able to have
those messages heard much more loudly and clearly than ever before by
using all platforms to communicate them.
In sum, I know that we have been and continue to be extremely faithful
and loyal to the agreement we entered into with our source, and are
doing our journalism exactly as we assured him he would. As Snowden
himself has said, he thinks that, too. That continues to be a
critically important metric for me.

[see pdf for citations / bib]
Fully homomorphic encryption has come a long way in a mere few years
since the first plausibly secure construction was introduced by Gentry
in 2009. This advance settled an open problem posed by Rivest, and
opened the door to many new applications. In a nutshell, by employing
FHE one may perform an arbitrary number of computations directly on
the encrypted data without revealing the secret key. This feature,
makes FHE a powerful tool in multi-party computing and perfectly
suited to protect sensitive data in distributed applications including
those hosted on semi-trusted cloud servers.
The eciency bottleneck that prevents FHE from being deployed in
real-life applications is now being bridged with the introduction of
numerous new optimizations and related proof-of-concept
implementations. The rst implementation of an FHE variant was proposed
by Gentry and Halevi. An impressive array of optimizations were
proposed with the goals of reducing the size of the public-key and
improving the performance of the primitives. Still, encryption of one
bit takes more than a second on a high-end Intel Xeon based server,
while recrypt primitive takes nearly half a minute for the lowest
security setting... a GPU based implementation of the same scheme was
developed which managed to reduce the recryption time to a few
Recently more ecient schemes emerged based on the hardness of
learning with errors (LWE) problem... Brakerski, Gentry, and
Vaikuntanathan (BGV) introduced an LWE based scheme that reduces the
need for bootstrapping. Instead the BGV scheme uses a new lightweight
method, i.e. modulus switching, to mitigate noise growth in
ciphertexts as homomorphic evaluation proceeds. While modulus
switching cannot restore the original level of noise as bootstrapping
does, it still manages to gain exponentially on depth of the circuits
evaluated without aecting the depth of the decryption circuit.
Therefore, as long as we can x the depth of the circuit a priori, we
can perform evaluations without bootstrapping using a leveled
implementation. Smart and Vercauteren presented a number of batching
techniques for packing multiple data streams into a single ciphertext.
Gentry, Halevi and Smart introduced the ï¬rst evaluation of a complex
circuit, i.e. a full AES
block evaluation by using a BGV style scheme introduced earlier by the
same authors. The scheme makes use of batching, key switching and
modulus switching techniques to obtain an eï¬cient leveled
implementation. Three batching techniques are used to obtain
bitâsliced, byteâsliced and SIMD implementations. With 5 minutes per
block evaluation time the byte-sliced implementation is faster, but
also requires less memory. The SIMD implementation takes about 40
minutes per block.
Alt-LÂ´pez, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan (ATV) presented a leveled FHE
scheme based on the modiï¬ed NTRU scheme introduced earlier by Stehle
and Steinfeld. A unique aspect of the ATV scheme is that it supports
homomorphic evaluation of ciphertexts encrypted by using public keys
assigned to diï¬erent parties. The authors outline the scheme using a
leveled implementation and introduce a technique called
relinearization to facilitate key switching during the levels of the
evaluation. Modulus switching is also performed after multiplication
and addition operations. The security of ATV scheme relies on two
assumptions: the ring LWE assumption, and the Decisional Small
Polynomial Ratio (DSPR) assumption. The scheme also supports
bootstrapping. While the scheme is appears to be eï¬cient, the analysis
... lacks concrete parameters.
Very recently Bos et al. presented a leveled implementation based on
ATV . The authors modify the proposed scheme in a number of aspects to
build up their own fully homomorphic scheme. The semantic security of
ATV is based on uniformity of the public key which relies on the DSPR
assumption.. the ATV scheme is modiï¬ed by adopting a tensor product
technique introduced by Brakerski such that the security depends only
on standard lattice assumptions. Furthermore, modulusâswitching is no
longer needed due to the reduced noise growth. Lastly, the authors
improve the ï¬exibility of the scheme by splitting the message using
the Chinese Remainder Theorem and then encrypting them into separate
ciphertexts. This makes integer based arithmetic easier and more
eï¬cient with a cost of a reduction in the depth of circuits that can
be evaluated with the scheme.
Our Contributions. We introduce an implementation of the ATV FHE
scheme along with a number of optimizations. More speciï¬cally we:
â¢ present a batched, bit-sliced implementation of the ATV scheme. The
implementation is generic and is not customized to optimally evaluate
any class of circuits (e.g. AES) more eï¬ciently than other.
â¢ resolve the parameter selection issue in the light of recent
theoretical and experimental results in the ï¬eld of lattice reduction.
â¢ introduce a specialization of the rings that simpliï¬es modulus
reduction and allows us to signiï¬cantly reduce the size of the public
key. We show that the impact of this specialization on the key space
is negligibly small. Even further, with the specialization key
switching is no longer needed.
â¢ rigorously analyze the noise growth of the ATV scheme over the
levels of computation, and develop a simple formula for estimating the
number of bits one needs to cut during the modulus reduction step.
â¢ homomorphically evaluate the full 128-bit AES circuit in a
bit-sliced implementation to demonstrate the scalability of the
introduced technique. Our implementation is 5 times faster than the
byte sliced implementation and 43 times faster than the SIMD
implementation of [other FHE...].

and of course, it's fun trying to protect against these attacks (e.g.
playing on "Hard Mode").  for some definition of "fun"...
the short list of mandatory steps to play the game:
- never mess up!  one mistake can be catastrophic. (this means
developing habits)
- source all hardware through retail outlets paid in cash. (avoid
targeted supply chain inserts)
- review all open source components related to key generation,
management, derivation, zeroisation.  or have someone you trust do so.
(see also: crowd funded TrueCrypt audit)  replace unsatisfactory parts
with better ones. (still using my own rngd; so glad to not have to
roll my own FDE boot and key mgmt anymore!)
- use extensive defense in depth.  Virtualization/Qubes, operating
system DACLs, user space separation, network isolation, offline-only
key management, the list is infinite!
- monitor everything: network traffic pre-encryption, running
processes, system calls, event logs, RF signals, sounds, power
consumption, at the highest granularity possible.  analyze what you
monitor for anomalies and failures. (if you aren't watching, you won't
know when you've caught something interesting, and/or need to harden
some first line defenses)
- custom build critical software components: kernel, crypto libs,
secure applications (ssh,openvpn,etc), high risk browsers, email
clients, chat clients, document viewers. (vast majority of exploits
are tailored for common builds - if you build your own with custom
configuration, suites, supported features, exploitation becomes a
tailored and time consuming effort against your specific system)
- employ camouflage to further thwart attempted attacks and increase
the likelihood they'll be detected.  look like WinXP but be a FreeBSD,
claim to be Firefox with plugins such and such while actually running
hardened chromium, spoof versions and platforms, etc. etc.
- employ userspace entropy collection, hardware entropy sources, and
strong entropy mixing across all applications, always! you may need
libc hooking or dalvik interception to make built-in entropy sources
not suck. (e.g. substrate for Android, LD_PRELOAD, etc.)  entropy is a
lucrative target, hard to verify, and often overlooked - make it a
- physical security is paramount: evil maid attacks, covert hw
keyloggers, TEMPEST leaking cables. if they get their hands on it, it
is pwned! (this may cramp your lifestyle)
- operational security: don't even know where to begin with this one.
bonus points for getting the fed chick[0] to take a bowl hit ;)
excellent; i like Python quite a bit for many tasks, and you'll want
to spend a week going through pypy/pip looking at useful modules.
other languages on my short list:
- C/C++ (it's everywhere.  it will remain everywhere.)
- Scheme/Lisp (for the perspective more than utility)
- Ruby/PHP/PERL (good complements to Python. except PHP, which should
be hated and ostracized :)

(5) threats to U.S. or allied Armed Forces or other U.S or allied

When did you first become aware that there had been an attempt to

your reaction to the administration going that far?
In general, how aware were you of surveillance and character

tie you to communist groups in Minnesota as per this conversation
between Nixon and John Mitchell?
WOW! That link is absolutely fascinating! (Even though I don't have
the time just now to go through it in detail, as I will shortly).
Thank you for the link! I have to ask, where is it from, where did you
get it (on the White House transcripts)?
Well, in answer to your question, I just became aware of some
surveillance on me (BEFORE the Pentagon papers came out) ten minutes
ago, from your link. I was being surveilled because I was a witness in
a criminal trial of draft resisters, some of the Minnesota Eight.
Their very good lawyer has been accused, I don't know on what basis,
of having been a Communist. And that allegation was not of particular
significance to the DOJ UNTIL, months later, he was associated with
me, after the Papers came out. Likewise, the president is heard
discussing with Haldeman on these transcripts the need to go back over
earlier (illegal, warrantless) wiretaps--of journalists and White
House officials, on which I was overheard--to see what might look
significant now, in light of the release of the Pentagon Papers.
That's what I've been talking about in earlier answers: the ability of
the government to go back to taps collected years earlier to look for
material with which to influence potential witnesses in the present.
(See their interest in the allegation that the wife of one journalist
may have been accused of shoplifting in her past). So people who have
"nothing to hide" should ask themselves if that is equally true of
their spouses or children, or neighbors, who could possibly be turned
into informants by threat of their private lives being revealed. (The

because he would have been questioned about his alleged
My analyst later apologized to me for not telling me about the
break-in--which he was sure was aimed at me, by the White
House--because his lawyer had advised him not to "get involved." So I
didn't know about it until it came out in my courtroom, thanks to John
Dean's revelation. All for the best. If he had told me and we had
raised it in the court-room, the plumbers would not have been kept on
the White House payroll (via CREEP) and would not have been ordered
into the Watergate. Nixon would have stayed in office, and the war

By Laura Blumenfeld
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, July 8, 2003
Sean Gorman's professor called his dissertation "tedious and
unimportant." Gorman didn't talk about it when he went on dates
because "it was so boring they'd start staring up at the ceiling." But
since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Gorman's work has become so
compelling that companies want to seize it, government officials want
to suppress it, and al Qaeda operatives -- if they could get their
hands on it -- would find a terrorist treasure map.
Tinkering on a laptop, wearing a rumpled T-shirt and a soul patch
goatee, this George Mason University graduate student has mapped every
business and industrial sector in the American economy, layering on
top the fiber-optic network that connects them.
He can click on a bank in Manhattan and see who has communication
lines running into it and where. He can zoom in on Baltimore and find
the choke point for trucking warehouses. He can drill into a cable
trench between Kansas and Colorado and determine how to create the
most havoc with a hedge clipper. Using mathematical formulas, he
probes for critical links, trying to answer the question: "If I were
Osama bin Laden, where would I want to attack?" In the background, he
plays the Beastie Boys.
For this, Gorman has become part of an expanding field of researchers
whose work is coming under scrutiny for national security reasons. His
story illustrates new ripples in the old tension between an open
society and a secure society.
"I'm this grad student," said Gorman, 29, amazed by his transformation
from geek to cybercommando. "Never in my wildest dreams would I have
imagined I'd be briefing government officials and private-sector
Invariably, he said, they suggest his work be classified. "Classify my
dissertation? Crap. Does this mean I have to redo my PhD?" he said.
"They're worried about national security. I'm worried about getting my
degree." For academics, there always has been the imperative to
publish or perish. In Gorman's case, there's a new concern: publish
and perish.
"He should turn it in to his professor, get his grade -- and then they
both should burn it," said Richard Clarke, who until recently was the
White House cyberterrorism chief. "The fiber-optic network is our
country's nervous system." Every fiber, thin as a hair, carries the
impulses responsible for Internet traffic, telephones, cell phones,
military communications, bank transfers, air traffic control, signals
to the power grids and water systems, among other things.
"You don't want to give terrorists a road map to blow that up," he
The Washington Post has agreed not to print the results of Gorman's
research, at the insistence of GMU. Some argue that the critical
targets should be publicized, because it would force the government
and industry to protect them. "It's a tricky balance," said Michael
Vatis, founder and first director of the National Infrastructure
Protection Center. Vatis noted the dangerous time gap between exposing
the weaknesses and patching them: "But I don't think security through
obscurity is a winning strategy."
Gorman compiled his mega-map using publicly available material he
found on the Internet. None of it was classified. His interest in maps
evolved from his childhood, he said, because he "grew up all over the
place." Hunched in the back seat of the family car, he would puzzle
over maps, trying to figure out where they should turn. Five years
ago, he began work on a master's degree in geography. His original
intention was to map the physical infrastructure of the Internet, to
see who was connected, who was not, and to measure its economic
"We just had this research idea, and thought, 'Okay,' " said his
research partner, Laurie Schintler, an assistant professor at GMU. "I
wasn't even thinking about implications."
The implications, however, in the post-Sept. 11 world, were enough to
knock the wind out of John M. Derrick Jr., chairman of the board of
Pepco Holdings Inc., which provides power to 1.8 million customers.
When a reporter showed him sample pages of Gorman's findings, he
exhaled sharply.
"This is why CEOs of major power companies don't sleep well these
days," Derrick said, flattening the pages with his fist. "Why in the
world have we been so stupid as a country to have all this information
in the public domain? Does that openness still make sense? It sure as
hell doesn't to me."
Recently, Derrick received an e-mail from an atlas company offering to
sell him a color-coded map of the United States with all the electric
power generation and transmission systems. He hit the reply button on
his e-mail and typed: "With friends like you, we don't need any
enemies in the world."
Toward the other end of the free speech spectrum are such people as
John Young, a New York architect who created a Web site with a friend,
featuring aerial pictures of nuclear weapons storage areas, military
bases, ports, dams and secret government bunkers, along with driving
directions from Mapquest.com. He has been contacted by the FBI, he
said, but the site is still up.
"It gives us a great thrill," Young said. "If it's banned, it should
be published. We like defying authority as a matter of principle."
This is a time when people are rethinking the idea of innocent
information. But it is hardly the first time a university has
entangled itself in a war. John McCarthy, who oversees Gorman's
project at GMU's National Center for Technology and Law, compared this
period to World War II, when academics worked on code-breaking and
atomic research. McCarthy introduced Gorman to some national security
contacts. Gorman's critical infrastructure project, he said, has
opened a dialogue among academia, the public sector and the private
sector. The challenge? "Getting everyone to trust each other,"
McCarthy said. "It's a three-way tension that tugs and pulls."
When Gorman and Schintler presented their findings to government
officials, McCarthy recalled, "they said, 'Pssh, let's scarf this up
and classify it.' "
And when they presented them at a forum of chief information officers
of the country's largest financial services companies -- clicking on a
single cable running into a Manhattan office, for example, and
revealing the names of 25 telecommunications providers -- the
executives suggested that Gorman and Schintler not be allowed to leave
the building with the laptop.
Businesses are particularly sensitive about such data. They don't want
to lose consumer confidence, don't want to be liable for security
lapses and don't want competitors to know about their weaknesses. The
CIOs for Wells Fargo and Mellon Financial Corp. attended the meeting.
Neither would comment for this story.
Catherine Allen, chief executive of BITS, the technology group for the
financial services roundtable, said the attendees were "amazed" and
"concerned" to see how interdependent their systems were. Following
the presentation, she said, they decided to hold an exercise in an
undisclosed Midwestern city this summer. They plan to simulate a cyber
assault and a bomb attack jointly with the telecommunications industry
and the National Communications System to measure the impact on
financial services.
McCarthy hopes that by identifying vulnerabilities, the GMU research
will help solve a risk management problem: "We know we can't have a
policeman at every bank and switching facility, so what things do you
Terrorists, presumably, are exploring the question from the other end.
In December 2001, bin Laden appeared in a videotape and urged the
destruction of the U.S. economy. He smiled occasionally, leaned into
the camera and said, "This economic hemorrhaging continues until
today, but requires more blows. And the youth should try to find the
joints of the American economy and hit the enemy in these joints, with
God's permission."
Every day, Gorman tries to identify those "joints," sitting in a gray
cinderblock lab secured by an electronic lock, multiple sign-on codes
and a paper shredder. No one other than Gorman, Schintler or their
research instructor, Rajendra Kulkarni, is allowed inside; they even
take out their own trash. When their computer crashed, they removed
the hard drive, froze it, smashed it and rubbed magnets over the
surface to erase the data.
The university has imposed the security guidelines. It is trying to
build a cooperative relationship with the Department of Homeland
Security. Brenton Greene, director for infrastructure coordination at
DHS, described the project as "a cookbook of how to exploit the
vulnerabilities of our nation's infrastructure." He applauds Gorman's
work, as long as he refrains from publishing details. "We would
recommend this not be openly distributed," he said.
Greene is trying to help the center get federal funding. ("The
government uses research funding as a carrot to induce people to
refrain from speech they would otherwise engage in," said Kathleen
Sullivan, dean of Stanford Law School. "If it were a command, it would
be unconstitutional.")
All this is a bit heavy for Gorman, who is in many ways a typical
student. His Christmas lights are still up in July; his living room
couch came from a trash pile on the curb. Twice a day, Gorman rows on
the Potomac. Out on the water, pulling the oars, he can stop thinking
about how someone could bring down the New York Stock Exchange or
cripple the Federal Reserve's ability to transfer money.
On a recent afternoon, he drove his Jeep from the Fairfax campus
toward the river. Along the way he talked about his dilemma: not
wanting to hurt national security; not wanting to ruin his career as
an academic.
"Is this going to completely squash me?" he said, biting his
fingernail. GMU has determined that he will publish only the most
general aspects of his work. "Academics make their name as an expert
in something. . . . If I can't talk about it, it's hard to get hired.
It's hard to put 'classified' on your list of publications on your
As he drove along Route 50, he pointed out a satellite tower and a
Verizon installation. Somewhere in Arlington he took a wrong turn and
stopped to ask for directions. It has always been that way with him.
He's great at maps, but somehow he ends up lost.

BATON: block cipher in use since at least 1995. 320-bit key and uses a
128-bit block in most modes, and also supports a 96-bit ECB mode. 160
bits of the key are checksum material. It supports a "shuffle" mode of

i find these kinds of experiments fascinating
   and would love to see more of them!
---------- Forwarded message ----------
You may have noticed that I, previously known only known under the
pseudonym adrelanos, decided to give up my pseudonymity. It was an
interesting experience to pseudonymously maintain a Linux distribution
(Whonix). I've learned a lot during these ~ 2 years.
I didn't have too bad luck in the lottery of life and are won a
citizenship, which is at low risk compared to less lucky ones. Living in
a country, where pseudonymity for this kind of activity isn't crucial.
Fortunately, according to latest press, neither the US nor Germany are
killing their own citizen for criticizing "the system". That is, the
mass surveillance police state, the military industrial complex, the
system of economy, that needs exponential growth to prevent imploding.
And so it doesn't become even worse, and better for the less lucky ones,
it is important to speak out in public and to take action.
Staying pseudonymous for such a long time became more and more a burden.
For me, it is not healthy for psychology. When pseudonymously working a
a project, you cannot tell anyone about it and they're wondering with
what you never tell much. You need to constantly second guess every tiny
action. Concentrate on not messing up. Also you'll never know if you
already messed up and if "they" already know who you are. You only need
to mess up once, and you're always linked to that project. Lucky me, I
wasn't forced to stay pseudonymous for ever.
I am looking forward to continue contributing to the awesome Free (as in
freedom) Software community. Being no longer pseudonymous allows me to
speak at conferences, to attend key singing parties, to meet up with
other developers, to voice chat with other developers, to chat on IRC
without fear of leaking too much information, to be less paranoid,
sometimes even running searches in clearnet if that is more convenient,
and so forth.

@_subject: Re: cypherpunks buy the farm 
The English language contains numerous euphemisms related to dying,
death, burial, and the people and places that deal with death. The
practice of using euphemisms for death is likely to have originated
with the magical belief that to speak the word "death" was to invite
death; where to "draw Death's attention" is the ultimate bad fortune:
a common theory holds that death is a taboo subject in most
English-speaking cultures for precisely this reason...
Someone who has died is said to have passed on, checked out, cashed in
their chips, bit the big one, kicked the bucket, keeled over, bit the
dust, popped their clogs, pegged it, carked it, was snuffed out,
turned their toes up, hopped the twig, bought the farm, got zapped,
written their epitaph, fell off their perch, croaked, gave up the
ghost (originally a more respectful term, cf. the death of Jesus as
translated in the King James Version of the Bible Mark 15:37), gone
south, gone west, gone to California, shuffled off this mortal coil
(from William Shakespeare's Hamlet), run down the curtain and joined
the Choir Invisible, or assumed room temperature (actually a
dysphemism in use among mortuary technicians). When buried, they may
be said to be pushing up daisies, sleeping the big sleep, taking a
dirt nap, gone into the fertilizing business, checking out the grass
from underneath or six feet under.
Euthanasia also attracts euphemisms. One may put one out of one's
misery, put one to sleep, or have one put down, the latter two phrases
being used primarily with dogs, cats, and horses who are being or have
been euthanized by a veterinarian. (These terms are not usually
applied to humans, because both medical ethics and law deprecate
Some euphemisms for killing are neither respectful nor playful, but
instead clinical and detached, including terminate, wet work, to take
care of one, to do them in, tooff, or to take them out. To cut loose
or open up on someone or something means "to shoot at with every
available weapon". Gangland euphemisms for murder includeventilate,
whack, rub out, liquidate, cut down, hit, take him for a ride, string
him up, cut down to size, or "put him in cement boots," "sleep with
the fishes" or "put him in a concrete overcoat," the latter three
implying disposal in deep water, if then alive by drowning; the
arrangement for a killing may be a simple "contract" with the victim
referred to as the "client," which suggests a normal transaction of
One of the most infamous euphemisms in history was the German term
Endlösung der Judenfrage, frequently translated in English as "the
Final Solution of the Jewish Question", a systematic plan for genocide
of the Jews. Even if not associated with the Holocaust, the Nazis used
such terms as Schutzhaft, best translated as "protective custody" for
persons seeking shelter from street violence by Nazi militias, but
such shelter leading quickly to long-term incarceration in a Nazi
prison for political offenders who often got murdered, and
Sonderbehandlung, whose translation "special treatment" implies
privileged protection but in practice meant summary execution. Nazi
officials authorized the disappearance of hostages into 'night and
fog' (Nacht und Nebel) whence few returned. "Charitable Ambulances"
for the buses which took mental patients away to killing centers, and
"Lazarett" (a quarantine clinic for ill travelers) for the
shooting-pits where severely ill death camp arrivals would be

@_subject: cypherpunks buy the farm 
regarding various altcoin pools for various eventualities:
consider a cypherpunk insurance pool with coins allocated fractionally
by some agreed upon method or individual contribution.  in the event
of their untimely demise for any reason, said funds delivered to
designated entity named by prior cryptographic signature (which must
be frequently re-attested).
would it be useful to have a pool for cypherpunks who "buy the farm"?
expenses per "buy the farm" may be as trivial as re-homing your cat
and books, or as extensive as a large family with medical
complications, significant debt obligations, and unexpected costly
events of unplanned nature requiring support decades into the future.
the only restriction which may be advisable is prohibiting the
designated beneficiary from running a death pool against specific or
general groups of individuals.  my distributed graph solver still
crunching, but preliminary results suggest that a critical threshold
of cypherpunks with wills to death pools combined with a specific
trigger set of few otherwise natural deaths multiplies into a
maelstrom of murder; presuming of course that a reasonably robust
death prediction market or assassination market comes into existence
which satisfies the pre-conditions of my computational game theory
model of this multi-party, multi-round stratagem mapped over a
topological isomorphism of the entire set of probabilities for a given
set of initial conditions into a single high order topological
manifold transformation collected in aggregate for an overall motif of

if the filter is due to absurd and extreme levels of zero information

Scientists detect spoiled onions trying to sabotage Tor privacy network
Rogue Tor volunteers perform attacks that try to degrade encrypted connections.
 by Dan Goodin - Jan 21 2014, 2:42pm PST
or reason  to crypto end to end...
Computer scientists have identified almost two dozen computers that
were actively working to sabotage the Tor privacy network by carrying
out attacks that can degrade encrypted connections between end users
and the websites or servers they visit.
The "spoiled onions," as the researchers from Karlstad University in
Sweden dubbed the bad actors, were among the 1,000 or so volunteer
computers that typically made up the final nodes that exited the
Torshort for The Onion Routernetwork at any given time in recent
months. Because these exit relays act as a bridge between the
encrypted Tor network and the open Internet, the egressing traffic is
decrypted as it leaves. That means operators of these servers can see
traffic as it was sent by the end user. Any data the end user sent
unencrypted, as well as the destinations of servers receiving or
responding to data passed between an end user and server, can be
monitoredand potentially modifiedby malicious volunteers. Privacy
advocates have long acknowledged the possibility that the National
Security Agency and spy agencies across the world operate such rogue
exit nodes.
The papertitled Spoiled Onions: Exposing Malicious Tor Exit Relaysis
among the first to document the existence of exit nodes deliberately
working to tamper with end users' traffic (a paper with similar
findings is here). Still, it remains doubtful that any of the 25
misconfigured or outright malicious servers were operated by NSA
agents. Two of the 25 servers appeared to redirect traffic when end
users attempted to visit pornography sites, leading the researchers to
suspect they were carrying out censorship regimes required by the
countries in which they operated. A third server suffered from what
researchers said was a configuration error in the OpenDNS server.
The remainder carried out so-called man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
designed to degrade encrypted Web or SSH traffic to plaintext traffic.
The servers did this by using the well-known sslstrip attack designed
by researcher Moxie Marlinspike or another common MitM technique that
converts unreadable HTTPS traffic into plaintext HTTP. Often, the
attacks involved replacing the valid encryption key certificate with a
forged certificate self-signed by the attacker.
"All the remaining relays engaged in HTTPS and/or SSH MitM attacks,"
researchers Philipp Winter and Stefan Lindskog wrote. "Upon
establishing a connection to the decoy destination, these relays
exchanged the destination's certificate with their own, self-signed
version. Since these certificates were not issued by a trusted
authority contained in TorBrowser's certificate store, a user falling
prey to such a MitM attack would be redirected to the about:certerror
warning page."
From Russia with love
The 22 malicious servers were among about 1,000 exit nodes that were
typically available on Tor at any given time over a four-month period.
(The precise number of exit relays regularly changes as some go
offline and others come online.) The researchers found evidence that
19 of the 22 malicious servers were operated by the same person or
group of people. Each of the 19 servers presented forged certificates
containing the same identifying information. The virtually identical
certificate information meant the MitM attacks shared a common origin.
What's more, all the servers used the highly outdated version 0.2.2.37
of Tor, and all but one of the servers were hosted in the network of a
virtual private system providers located in Russia. Several of the IP
addresses were also located in the same net block.
The researchers caution that there's no way to know that the operators
of the malicious exit nodes are the ones carrying out the attacks.
It's possible the actual attacks may be carried out by the ISPs or
network backbone providers that serve the malicious nodes. Still, the
researchers discounted the likelihood of an upstream provider of the
Russian exit relays carrying out the attacks for several reasons. For
one, the relays relied on a diverse set of IP address blocks,
including one based in the US. The relays frequently disappeared after
they were flagged as untrustworthy, researchers also noted.
The researchers identified the rogue volunteers by scanning for server
relays that replaced valid HTTPS certificates with forged ones. That
might have helped to detect certificate forgery attacks such as the
one used in 2011 to monitor 300,000 Gmail userswouldn't be detected
using the methods devised by the researchers. The researchers don't
believe the malicious nodes they observed were operated by the NSA or
other government agencies.
"Organizations like the NSA have read/write access to large parts of
the Internet backbone," Karlstad University's Winter wrote in an
e-mail. "They simply do not need to run Tor relays. We believe that
the attacks we discovered are mostly done by independent individuals
who want to experiment."
While the confirmation of malicious exit nodes is important, it's not
particularly surprising. Tor officials have long warned that Tor does
nothing to encrypt plaintext communications once it leaves the
network. That means ISPs, remote sites, VPN providers, and the Tor
exit relay itself can all see the communications that aren't encrypted
by end users and the parties they communicate with. Tor officials have
long counseled users to rely on HTTPS, e-mail encryption, or other
methods to ensure that traffic receives end-to-end encryption.
The researchers have proposed a series of updates to the "Torbutton"
software used by most Tor users. Among other things, the
proof-of-concept software fix would use an alternative exit relay to
refetch all self-signed certificates delivered over Tor. The software
would then compare the digital fingerprints of the two certificates.
It's feasible that the changes might one day include certificate
pinning, a technique for ensuring that a certificate presented by
Google, Twitter, and other sites is the one authorized by the operator
rather than a counterfeit one. Several hours after this article went
live, Winter published this blog post titled What the "Spoiled Onions"
paper means for Tor users.

many of the best detections for advanced attacks involved not-quite
consumer hardware and customized systems for distributed storage,
observation, and processing.  this is way beyond the budget, skill,
and time afforded even modestly technical users for most intents and
 sometimes simple measures to thwart attacks combined with a keen
situational awareness can identify sophisticated attacks with less
technical means.  anomalies signal to attempt counter measures and
initiate in depth scrutiny.
consider the following,
- baseband attack against mobile target:
 + cannot "hot patch" running image, as some changes take effect
during initialization.  force push results in restart. anomaly  + battery longevity one third what expected, distinct transition
post-baseband-push for longevity of full charge - power consumption
doesn't lie. anomaly  + abnormal signal power level for well known location for cell link.
anomaly  + outbound dial attempts cannot put cell radio into lower bitrate
audio call mode - outbound dial attempts fail - serious anomaly (workaround of making call immediately on boot appears effective, and
keeping a call in voice mode appears to thwart data exfiltation when
no wifi uplink avail.
 + (technical but possible) pushed baseband needs to pass
authentication of image; signature valid, revision same as prior mtd
partition archive version, however sha digests do NOT match! this is
not expected for the same build version. anomaly consider the following,
- BIOS attack with post-boot re-infection vector triggered once
graphics mode transitions from console to graphical display:
 + target hardware is a match and supported, however, root file system
is XFS, ZFS, or other unsupported *nix variant.  attempt to persist by
injection on file system using kernel fs funcs and data structures
(this gets around FDE by interacting before
luks/mdcrypt/loopaes/cryptoloop layer) thus causes kernel panic.
anomaly  [note: A for effort++ by setting a not-again flag after first
attempt.  this prevents the kernel panic from becoming a persistent
DoS as the next boot attempt will complete normally into graphical
desktop.  Subsequent reactivation follows similar fail safe of next
boot succeeding after post boot persistent hook failure and kernel
consider the following,
- SMS MitM attack against Android mobile target:
 + normal delivery of SMS using a client such as TextSecure that
checks for delivery confirmation on SMS, (do NOT use fire-and-forget
like majority of text clients).  attack introduces latency on
confirmation due to radio mode switching between high rate exfiltation
mode and low rate SMS with additional MitM proxy processing latency
added as well. this results in messages initially showing "Message
delivery failed" before shortly then confirming successful
transmisssion. anomaly + abnormal signal power level for well known location for cell link. anomaly

Format-Transforming Encryption (FTE) is a novel cryptographic
primitive that extends traditional encryption... FTE takes a key,
message and format (a compact set descriptor) as input and outputs a
ciphertext in the format set. As an example, a format may describe the
set of valid HTTP messages.
fteproxy bootstraps FTE to relay arbitrary data streams. In turn, this
enables fteproxy to use a regular expression that captures an
uncensored protocol (e.g., HTTP), then employ fteproxy to tunnel a
censored protocol (e.g., Tor, TLS, SSH, etc.) To the network monitor,
traffic looks like HTTP, even though it's actually a censored

The inside story of MIT and Aaron Swartz
More than a year after Swartz killed himself rather than face
prosecution, questions about MIT's handling of the hacking case
 By Marcella Bombardieri | Globe Staff   March 30, 2014
CAMBRIDGE -- The mysterious visitor called himself Gary Host at first,
then Grace Host, which he shortened for his made-up e-mail address to
"ghost," a joke apparently, perhaps signaling mischievousness -- or
menace. The intruder was lurking somewhere on the MIT campus,
downloading academic journal articles by the hundreds of thousands.
The interloper was eventually traced to a laptop under a box in a
basement wiring closet. He was Aaron Swartz, a brilliant young
programmer and political activist. The cascade of events that followed
would culminate in tragedy: a Secret Service investigation, a federal
prosecution, and ultimately Swartz's suicide.
But in the fall of 2010, Swartz was still a stranger in the shadows,
and the university faced a hard question: How big a threat was the
"ghost" downloader? And a harder one: What should be done about him?
Answering those questions would prove a particularly knotty puzzle for
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a place long supportive of
the free flow of information and so famously friendly to pranks, known
in MIT lingo as hacks, that a book published by the MIT Museum in the
1990s offered pranksters such tips as "always have two ways to run."
And yet, MIT is a cradle of world-class scientific research with
unpublished data and unpatented inventions on its network, and its
leaders felt vulnerable to the rising tide of high-tech espionage.
"There is some speculation that this might have been an MIT student
experimenting with a robot," one MIT employee noted in an e-mail after
a second breach by Swartz was discovered. But another pointed out that
"sinister foreigners'' may have stolen credentials or compromised a
MIT's efforts to track down Swartz, while under intense pressure from
JSTOR, the not-for-profit that ran the journal database, eventually
would lead to felony computer crimes charges that might have brought
years in jail. Swartz, 26, was under indictment when he committed
suicide in January 2013.
Critics, both on campus and around the world, have accused MIT of
abandoning its values celebrating inventive risk-taking by helping to
doom a young man whose project -- likely an act of civil disobedience
to make information freely available -- didn't in the end cause serious
MIT has insisted it maintained an appropriate, even compassionate,
neutrality toward a determined hacker who stole 4.8 million articles
and eluded numerous efforts to stop him before the college sought help
from police.
But MIT's brand of neutrality proved one with notable limits,
according to a Globe review of more than 7,000 pages of discovery
documents -- many of them e-mails -- from Swartz's court case. In the
wake of his death, both MIT and JSTOR posted online documents that
they had turned over to authorities, a trove that drew little if any
notice at the time. The Globe also obtained a number of e-mails
related to the case not available publicly.
Only with a patient review of the complete record does the full
picture of the dilemma MIT faced become clear. The aftershocks of the
choices the institution made in the wake of the "ghost" continue to
reverberate, on campus and off, more than a year after Swartz's death.
Most vividly, the e-mails underscore the dissonant instincts the
university grappled with. There was the eagerness of some MIT
employees to help investigators and prosecutors with the case, and
then there was, by contrast, the glacial pace of the institution's
early reaction to the intruder's provocation.
MIT, for example, knew for 2 1/2 months which campus building the
downloader had operated out of before anyone searched it for him or
his laptop -- even as the university told JSTOR they had no way to
identify the interloper.
And once Swartz was unmasked, the ambivalence continued. MIT never
encouraged Swartz's prosecution, and once told his prosecutor they had
no interest in jail time. However, e-mails illustrate how MIT
energetically assisted authorities in capturing him and gathering
evidence -- even prodding JSTOR to get answers for prosecutors more
quickly -- before a subpoena had been issued.
In a handful of e-mails, individual MIT employees involved in the case
aired sentiments that were far from neutral. One, for example, gushed
to prosecutor Stephen P. Heymann about the quality of the indictment
of Swartz.
"Nicely done Steve and kudos! All points . . . are as accurate as I've
ever seen," wrote the information technology employee. "(I only say
that because every time I've ever given an interview, details are
always slightly to horribly munged; not that I ever expected any less,
it's just a true relief and very refreshing to see your accuracy and
Yet if MIT eventually adopted a relatively hard line on Swartz, the
university had also helped to make his misdeeds possible, the Globe
review found. Numerous e-mails make it clear that the unusually easy
access to the campus computer network, which Swartz took advantage of,
had long been a concern to some of the university's information
technology staff.
Some at MIT believed that officials had failed to pay serious
attention to what one person called "poor, limited, or outdated
security protections" on resources like the JSTOR database.
The documents also put JSTOR's role in the case in a new light. In
contrast to MIT, the journal archive organization has been widely
hailed for publicly distancing itself from Swartz's prosecution,
declaring that once Swartz returned the documents, it "had no interest
in this becoming an ongoing legal matter."
But a number of JSTOR's internal e-mails show a much angrier face in
the months that Swartz eluded capture, with employees sharing
frustration about MIT's "rather tepid level of concern." JSTOR
officials repeatedly raised the prospect, among themselves, of going
to the police, e-mails show.
"What's wrong with us . . . alerting the cyber-crimes division of law
enforcement and initiating an investigation, having a cop search a
dorm room and try to retrieve any hard drive that contains our
content?" asked one JSTOR official, whose name -- like most -- was
redacted in the released documents.
In the end, JSTOR neither called the police nor asked MIT to do so,
according to its president.
Eric Grimson, who recently stepped down as chancellor of MIT, defended
the university's handling of the case as a judicious effort to protect
the community without seeking retribution. MIT's first steps, he said,
were simply to deny the downloader access to the network. They didn't
search for the laptop for many weeks because they thought he had been
When Swartz proved undeterred, he said, MIT had to do more.
"We were confronted with a situation of an unknown user accessing our
network," he said in an interview, "using it to download massive
amounts of material . . . for a three-month period, and evading our
efforts to try and stop it."
MIT was harmed in the process, Grimson said, with 10,000 researchers
denied an important resource for several days as JSTOR sought to cut
off the mass downloading.
Helping investigators pursue the campus intruder was the only
reasonable course, he said.
"I think we should as a matter of principle cooperate with law
enforcement in an investigation of an alleged crime being committed on
our campus," he said. "That's protecting our community."
After Swartz's arrest, Grimson said, the university went out of its
way to be fair to the defense, voluntarily making staff members
available to answer questions from Swartz's attorneys.
"I would like to suggest we took a path to try to balance being
empathetic to Aaron's situation while acknowledging that there was a
legal process involved," he said.
Allure of openness
Swartz was an Internet prodigy. By age 19, he had helped to build RSS,
a service that allowed users to create personalized news feeds; to
develop the social news website Reddit; and to establish Creative
Commons, an alternative to traditional copyright more friendly to
In his 20s, the restless Stanford dropout turned his energies to
political activism. He helped launch several progressive political
groups and was a major force behind a national wave of protest against
the Stop Online Piracy Act, which targeted unauthorized sharing of
videos and music, but which Swartz and others saw as an attack on free
While Swartz's motive for downloading the JSTOR archive remains
unknown, there is one simple and plausible possibility: to make
academic research freely available to the public. In 2008, he
published a "Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto" in which he avowed a
"moral imperative" to share scholarship locked behind exorbitant
subscription walls.
"It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil
disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public
culture," he wrote.
But why use MIT as his gateway -- or, to some eyes, his victim? He had
a fellowship at Harvard at the time, which gave him access to JSTOR,
but apparently worried about getting himself or his colleagues in hot
water, since bulk downloading is forbidden by JSTOR.
Since MIT had been known for generations for its idealistic devotion
to the spirit of openness, venturing a couple of miles down
Massachusetts Avenue may have seemed irresistible to Swartz. He had no
formal tie to the university but had friends there and had been
involved in campus activities.
A blog entry Swartz wrote in 2009, titled "Honest Theft," neatly
details his view of the school as a haven for rebelliousness. He
described friends who he said secretly lived for free on campus,
sleeping on couches in common rooms and stealing food from the
cafeterias -- and using the money they saved "to promote the public
"MIT has a notoriously relaxed security policy," he wrote, so his
friends "likely wouldn't get in too much trouble."
Indeed, MIT's own 180-page internal report on the Swartz case,
released in July by a panel led by professor Hal Abelson, described a
"culture of creative disobedience where students are encouraged to
explore secret corners of the campus, commit good-spirited acts of
vandalism . . . and resist restrictions that seem arbitrary or
Student "hacks" have included putting a faux firetruck on the MIT
Great Dome and turning a high-rise facade into a working Tetris game.
They are meant to be public and harmless, but often involve
trespassing and "borrowing" materials without permission, like a 3-ton
cannon brazenly snatched from Caltech.
The ethic of openness extends to MIT's computer network, where anyone
on campus can get onto the wired network for 14 days by logging on as
a guest, an extremely unusual perk for visitors to a university
As an MIT manager of network security noted in an e-mail reviewing the
downloading case as it unfolded in October 2010, misuse of the MIT
network was made possible by the fact that there was "no
authentication of visitors" and "no identity verification."
The open-door policy meant Swartz could easily sign in, as he did, as
an anonymous guest with fake names and disposable e-mail addresses.
Between 5 p.m. on Sept. 25, 2010, and 4 a.m. the next morning, the
code Swartz wrote, which he called "keepgrabbing," downloaded 450,000
JSTOR articles.
It was the opening salvo in a cat-and-mouse game that would extend
over three months. JSTOR would cut off the Internet protocol address
Swartz was using; he would switch to another. MIT detected and shut
down the registration for his computer; he altered his computer's
identifying information.
Officials would conclude the ghost downloader had moved on, then he'd
reappear weeks later.
The maddening pursuit prompted some MIT technology personnel to say,
essentially, I told you so. Databases like JSTOR's, some said, should
have been kept behind a virtual gate -- though this would inconvenience
legitimate users.
"I frankly don't know why it's not used more," an employee wrote about
such a security measure.
Another employee in network security lamented that only the Swartz
case prompted MIT to smarten up. "I hope it helps enlighten them to
the need to really think long and hard about these issues. Kind of
silly that it took a JSTOR crawling issue to get everyone a little
MIT and JSTOR did agree to a security upgrade after Swartz's second
round of downloading was discovered in October 2010, requiring those
seeking access to have MIT credentials. But it took JSTOR weeks to
prepare for the change, the e-mails show.
That delay would prove fateful. Aaron Swartz had only gotten started.
Drawing concern at JSTOR
Given the institution's global stature, MIT inevitably drew most of
the public focus. But what Swartz did was more of a threat to JSTOR, a
small organization in a precarious position. Its business is selling
access to journal articles, but it doesn't own those articles. If it
can't protect them, the journals could yank their material out of the
library and threaten JSTOR's survival.
Swartz ultimately downloaded 80 percent of JSTOR's archive, 4.8
million articles. At one point his downloading was so rapid, JSTOR
e-mails said it created "a monstrous amount" of traffic that was
"threatening the website."
The stakes for MIT were murkier. The university's contract with JSTOR
promised that it would guard against misuse, so there was some risk of
losing an important library resource. And a rogue stranger poking
around MIT's network could be truly dangerous. The discovery shortly
before Swartz's arrest that his computer was being contacted from
China raised passing fears of a foreign cyberattack, e-mails show,
although such probing from overseas is quite routine.
Yet MIT was used to seeing excessive downloading -- albeit on a much
smaller scale -- and some staff downplayed the threat.
"There will always be one person a semester who, regardless of intent,
will write a script to crawl through some catalog," an MIT employee
wrote when JSTOR first cut off the portion of campus where Swartz was
operating. The MIT worker called JSTOR's move "draconian" and
The result of their differing vulnerabilities, e-mails indicate, was
that JSTOR was far more bellicose toward the interloper than was MIT --
at least until the days right before Swartz's arrest.
JSTOR pressed again and again for MIT to find the downloader. Some of
the archive's employees said MIT was being cooperative, but other
staff members were irate at the university.
"I am sure that if they had lost an equivalent number of books from
their library overnight (what 25,000-30,000 books) they would not be
so nonchalant," someone at JSTOR wrote in an e-mail.
"This is an astronomical number of articles -- again, real theft,"
another wrote. "Does the university contact law enforcement? Would
they be willing to do so in this instance?"
When Swartz popped up again in late December after weeks of quiet, the
tension was even plainer.
"I might just be irked because I am up dealing with [the downloader]
on a Sunday night," a JSTOR employee wrote, "but I am starting to feel
like [MIT needs] to get a hold of this situation and right away or we
need to offer to send them some help (read FBI)."
These were "heat of the moment" reactions by officials anxious about
an unknown threat, said Kevin M. Guthrie, president of ITHAKA, JSTOR's
parent organization.
"You get a report that 100,000 articles have been downloaded on a
Saturday, you're trying to figure out what to do," he said in an
As for JSTOR's internal comments about calling the police, he said,
"We talked about it, but we made a decision -- no, this wouldn't be
appropriate; it's not our role to indicate that law enforcement should
be called."
When it came to Swartz's prosecution, JSTOR was notably reticent. It
insisted on being served with a subpoena before it would provide
information to the government and then, according to Abelson's report,
tried to limit its answers.
Guthrie told the Globe that the not-for-profit was simply trying to be
careful. As for its decision to publicly oppose prosecution, he said,
once Swartz returned the files, the journal provider was no longer
interested in the matter.
JSTOR was "trying to balance our obligation both to be good stewards
of the content for the content owners and publishers, for our own
viability, for broad access to information, and then the personal
situation, the human situation," Guthrie said.
JSTOR's very existence, he said, is all about broadening access to
scholarly journals. Its fees go to support the archive, and it
provides free access in developing countries.
E-mails from before Swartz was captured suggest that JSTOR might also
have been worried about its public image. The archive is already
viewed in some quarters as a greedygatekeeper constricting the pursuit
of knowledge. One JSTOR employee, in an e-mail addressing the
possibility of bringing in law enforcement, noted several technical
obstacles after opening with, "aside from the considerations about the
PR of it all . . . "
A sudden shift
If MIT was initially slow to react to the "ghost," even tepid about
the whole thing as some at JSTOR surmised, that changed drastically
after the university learned of another breach in December 2010.
After the laptop Swartz was accused of setting up to download JSTOR
articles was found in a wiring closet at MIT, investigators left the
computer up and running and installed a hidden camera.
On the night after Christmas, JSTOR discovered a new round of
downloading. It had actually started some 10 weeks earlier, but Swartz
had slowed the process enough to avoid tripping alarms.
Out on a furlough, MIT staff did not get the urgent messages from
JSTOR until Jan. 3, 2011. "This is a heck of a way to start the new
year," one person at MIT wrote. "We need to escalate the seriousness
of our response. This looks like grand theft."
And escalate MIT did. The academic building where the activity seemed
to emanate from had been pinpointed in mid-October. But only on the
morning of Jan. 4 did a network engineer began searching Building 16.
He quickly discovered a laptop, hidden under a cardboard box,
connected to the network from a wiring closet in the basement.
MIT police decided they needed more help, and called a Cambridge
police detective who belonged to a regional electronic crimes task
force. He showed up with another task force member, a Secret Service
agent named Michael S. Pickett.
Seeking not only to find the downloader but to collect as much
evidence as possible, they set up a hidden camera in the wiring
closet. And instead of shutting down the laptop, the authorities
decided to "leave it up and running for a couple of days while the
investigation continues," a library employee wrote in an e-mail.
"Now a federal case," the library staffer wrote in separate notes she
took on a conversation with an MIT security analyst. "We [MIT] are
considered the victim. All we provide is by choice -- not subpoenaed."
That cooperation with law enforcement also extended to a senior MIT
network engineer who monitored traffic to and from Swartz's laptop and
appeared to be looking to Pickett for instructions. On Jan. 5, having
collected 70 gigabytes of network traffic, he e-mailed the agent, "I
was just wondering what the next step is."
Swartz's lawyers argued that MIT, by monitoring Swartz and turning
over materials to law enforcement without a court order, violated his
Fourth Amendment rights. Abelson, who wrote MIT's own review,
disagreed, and legal experts interviewed by the Globe differed on
whether those arguments had merit. They were never ruled on by the
judge in the case.
Grimson, the former university chancellor, acknowledged in an
interview that it would have been "cleaner" to ask prosecutors to seek
a court order sooner. Turning over evidence without a subpoena raised,
in some eyes, painful questions about MIT's avowed neutrality.
Swartz was identified by the hidden camera and arrested on Jan. 6
after allegedly trying to flee police on Massachusetts Avenue in
The startling discovery that the "ghost" downloader was a well-known
activist prompted a few MIT employees to share their opinions with
Pickett, the Secret Service agent, or their colleagues.
"Looks like he is a big hacker, i googled him," one wrote to Pickett
at midnight the morning after Swartz's arrest.
That afternoon, someone from the IT security department wrote to
Pickett, deeming Swartz a "really intelligent kid that just got buried
under an avalanche of dumb."
A few days later, Swartz took to Twitter to ask his followers if they
knew anyone at JSTOR, presumably hoping he could defuse the situation.
One person at MIT responded by circulating among colleagues a made-up
message purporting to be what Swartz wanted to say to JSTOR.
"hi, jstor, I'm still a few million pdf's shy of grabbing your whole
db; really had high hopes on collecting the whole set by 1/1/11," it
read. "could you tell me what number I left off at, because I don't
currently have access to my lappy that was keeping track. k thnx bye."
The MIT employee's commentary on his or her own fictional tweet: "LOL."
The documents say little about what MIT was thinking and doing once
the case morphed from an investigation into an active prosecution. But
MIT's own report on the case raises serious questions about the wisdom
of MIT's neutrality stance.
The report noted that some within MIT believe "there has been a change
in the institutional climate over recent years, where decisions have
become driven more by a concern for minimizing risk than by strong
affirmation of MIT values."
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has been widely condemned as extreme
in both its sweeping scope and its grave punishments. Sentencing
guidelines suggest Swartz faced up to seven years in prison.
To his supporters, MIT bears some responsibility for that fact. MIT
officials privately told the prosecutor that the university had no
interest in jail time, but refused to oppose his prosecution publicly
or privately, despite repeated entreaties from Swartz's father, his
lawyers, and a couple of faculty members, who argued MIT had the
institutional heft to influence the US attorney's office.
MIT may have also missed an opportunity to point out a potentially
serious flaw in the case against Swartz.
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act charges centered on the claim that
Swartz had unauthorized access to MIT and JSTOR's networks. But even
if he was doing something improper, Swartz was logged on at MIT as a
guest, leading Abelson and some legal observers to conclude that his
access could be construed as authorized.
It was hardly a clear-cut case, and the judge may not have agreed. But
either way, MIT -- resolute about not getting drawn into a criminal
case to which it was not a named party -- "paid little attention to the
details of the charges," Abelson found. The institute simply did not
consider whether Swartz may have been an authorized user under the
terms of the law, according to the report.
The defense didn't raise it, either, until close to Swartz's death.
MIT was helping the prosecution "understand how to prosecute, what
information is necessary to prosecute, but not taking steps to help
them understand the limits to their prosecution," said Lawrence
Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor who was close to Swartz.
"Nobody would call that neutral. That's aiding and abetting the
Grimson defended MIT's decision to leave it up to the justice system
to decide Swartz's fate, given that MIT leaders believe he harmed the
school. And he disagreed that MIT is less driven by its ideals than it
once was. He pointed to the Abelson report as an example of MIT's
willingness to soul-search and learn from a tragedy.
Still, he said, MIT will be second-guessing itself for a long time,
and the university is still considering some policy changes in light
of what happened to Swartz. Its first concrete move, last month, was
to set up a presidential committee that will create an online data
privacy policy.
A famously sensitive person, Swartz had some history with depression.
Yet loved ones insist that he was not clinically depressed before he
hanged himself in his Brooklyn apartment on Jan. 11, 2013, but
overwhelmed by the threat of years injail and the toll of fighting the
His father, Bob Swartz, believes that MIT's lack of compassion helped
destroy his son's life.
"We can't bring Aaron back, he can no longer be the tireless worker
for good," he said at a memorial service for his son held at MIT last
spring. "What we can do is change things for the better. We can work
to change MIT so that it . . . once again becomes a place where risk
and coloring outside the lines is encouraged, a space where the
cruelties of the world are pushed back and our most creative flourish
rather than being crushed."

fwd, and added comment at end about a "upstream distribution" of repute.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
this too, a much longer discussion.  we are in agreement, though one point:
when FreeBSD decided against direct use of _both_ RDRAND and XSTORE,
it was not an equal dismissal.  RDRAND is specifically, and
intentionally designed without direct access to the physical entropy
sources, while XSTORE allows direct access to a userspace entropy
daemon through the MSR configuration bits.
XSTORE in raw mode, to userspace entropy daemon (rngd) that
continously monitors for catastrophic failure (as above), and then
_conservatively_ digests and folds the entropy before adding to OS
kernel entropy pool is a robust configuration.
RDRAND and RDSEED inherently crippled - if you had to pick a design,
you would pick raw access with open and independent validation of
run-time behavior with configurable conservative'ness as you so chose.
instead, NIST and FIPS push _hard_ on opaque designs without raw
access.  in turn, US Gov pushes vendors hard for NIST/FIPS compliance.
 this is just one stream of influence working against the interest of
users and strong privacy.
if you really want to do entropy without repute:
 1.: it starts with development and distribution, where every host and
runtime is seeded with distinct mastering entropy that is mixed on
first boot.**
 2.: every physical host contains two (redundant) physical entropy
sources run in continuous verification with immediate halt/panic on
dual physical source failure.
 3.: opportunistic entropy gathering daemons also running on host
including haveged, dakarand, and kernel interrupt and activity
 4.: virtio-random device support feed into guest OSes from host
entropy pool. (Qemu, KVM, Vbox, etc.)
 5.: at shutdown of physical host entropy state is saved to FDE
protected root volume for re-incorporation into entropy state on next
 6.: as signal of care, in all mastering images and runtime ensure
that /dev/urandom links to /dev/random special device.
 7.: use the strace to confirm in every application that appropriate
entropy from /dev/*random is read when generating keys or nonces.
  [post to HN when confused about key length equivalences and
application level entropy pools...]
**  your distribution in turn is fully reproducible, and the builder
of your images provides you an installation image signed by them,
including all the other public sigs, and including the per-instance
entropy, the entirety of which is then also signed again.  you
exchanged keys in person at some point in the past, to get your first

in the SSO overview slide there are three colors:
  i fancy them as follows:
GREEN: legally compelled and gagged plaintext access through service
providers, like BLARNEY and PRISM
RED: financially motivated secret agreement with "special partners"
for filthy lucre. e.g. GTE fiber access.
BLUE: unilateral / non-cooperative operations; covert black bag taps.
if most facilities, like room 641A, are in RED zones, then recent
ground breaking improvements in BLUE may be miniaturized and covert
taps with selectors and large local cache.
alternatively, new capability could be upgrades to the RED facilities
where BLUE traffic is conveniently co-processed, cached, and

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Recommended reading:
(PDF copypasta with missing characters following):
6 Conclusion
In this paper we argued for the removal of CA certi cates that do not
sign any certi cates used in HTTPS connections from desktop and browser
trust stores. We based our analysis on an Internet-wide dataset of 48
million HTTPS certi cates and compared them to trust stores from all
major browser and OS vendors. We were able to identify 140 CA
certi cates included in twelve trust stores from all major platforms
that are never used for signing certi cates used in HTTPS. Based on
these ndings, we suggest to remove or restrict these CA certi cates.
Using two months' worth of TLS handshake data from our university
network, we con rmed that removing these certi cates from users' trust
stores would not result in a single HTTPS warning message. Thus, this
action provides a simple and low-cost real-world improvement that users
can implement right now to make their HTTPS connections more secure. We
are working on creating tools and scripts to automate this process for
diï¬erent browsers and operating systems.
Our current list of CAs we recommend for removal is a conservative one.
It includes all CAs that have never signed a HTTPS certi cate. In future
work,we would like to analyze the trade-oï¬ between false positives and
the size of the trust store, as well as look into mechanisms to restrict
the capabilities of certi cates on the Android platform.

quote appears to be from this story:
Asked whether he has been harassed when writing about Snowden, Gellman said no.
"I have not been harassed. I've had some interesting exchanges with
government reps of various temperatures. But I speak to them before
every story. If they want to demonstrate falsity I want to hear it,
and if they want to tell me about specific damage I would be doing
then it want to hear that too. I get warnings about the espionage act
and I assume that I'm more interesting than I used to be. And Google
has warned me that they believe a state-sponsored hacker is attempting
to compromise my computer... I assume that is more likely to be a
foreign agency."
Snowden has shown the 'huge disparity of surveillance and power', says Gellman
Government needs reminding that they work for us, says
Pulitzer-winning reporter Barton Gellman, who describes Edward Snowden
as ending an era of indifference to surveillance
Jemima Kiss
theguardian.com, Monday 10 March 2014 16.45 GMT
Encryptions tools must be simplified and made accessible for the
mainstream, Pulitzer-winning journalist Barton Gellman said on Monday,
calling on the tech industry to have the courage and ingenuity to help
address the disparity of power between the people and their
Addressing the SXSW festival shortly before Edward Snowden's live
speech by video, Gellman said we are a long way off simple,
transparent encryption tools. He cited Pew research which found that
88% of Americans say they have taken steps to protect their privacy in
some form.
"With all the user interface brains out there we could get easier
tools," he said. "But it's not just the ability to encrypt, it's a
frame of mind, a workflow and a discipline that is alien to most
people, and that is the opposite to the open nature of the consumer
internet. You could use Tor to access a site a hundred times, but the
101st time you forget, you may as well not have used Tor."
"There are people at this conference who have taken very considerable
risk to protect the privacy of their customers and have put themselves
at the edge of the door to jail and it will take courage as well as
ingenuity to change the way things work."
Metadata is more powerful than phone tapping
Gellman, who interviewed Snowden in Russia in 2013, said Snowden has
highlighted the peak indifference to security. Metadata is incredibly
potent as a method of surveillance, yet most internet users fail to
understand how powerful it can be in aggregate.
"One of the great gifts of Snowden is that he has shown what
surveillance can do," he said. Gellman told of a colleague who said he
wasn't concerned about metadata and his privacy, a colleague who used
Twitter heavily and with location stamps.
So Gellman downloaded three months worth of Twitter location stamps
and plotted them on a Google map, plotting the times, frequency and
significance of each location. His horrified colleague consequently
changed much of his behaviour online.
"I would rather someone listened in to all my phone calls than
accessed my metadata - you can learn much more about me from that
Whistleblowers - traitors or lantern bearers?
Gellman doesn't like the word 'whistleblower'. On one side are many in
government who say he signed an agreement not to disclose information,
and that disclosing specific unlawful behaviour, or waste, should be
dealt with by internal channels. Snowden himself did speak to around
ten supervisors and to colleagues informally with some questions about
their work, and at one point asked if what they were doing would pass
'the front page test'.
"That's a pretty bold thing to do when you're gathering documents and
speaking to three reporters," he said. "But the illegality test is too
"If the idea is genuine that the government works for us, and
information is power, we are living inside a one-way mirror because
they know more and more about us and we know less and less about them.
There's a huge disparity of power."
"Do we think it's a good idea to listen to every call, to bust
encryption standards... if it's a big policy question, and stuff is
being done behind our backs that might shock us if we knew about it,
there's pretty good reason to put it out there. Forget whistleblower -
it should be lantern holder."
How has the NSA surveillance story stayed live?
"Snowden paid very careful attention to what had happened to other
whistleblowers that hadn't had a long-term impact, and was careful to
produce the documents... If Snowden had asked me 6-8 months later [if
this story and still been live] but he has got to have exceed every
plausible estimation about impact. It's because he didn't realise the
documents all at once."
That pace was less about Snowden releasing the documents slowly but
about the work journalists need to do to verify and interrogate before
they publish.
Doctorow said he was most concerned by the programmes known as Bullrun
in the US and Edgehill in the UK, which saw the NSA spend $250,000 a
year spend trying to sabotage security standards and have backdoors
built into security products.
"In the second world war, countries had their own encryption tools but
now we share networks and tools, and if you can undermine the random
number generator - if you can make it less random - and that's what
the NSA was doing by trying to trick, buy or persuade companies to
make their encryption more breakable," said Gellman. "They would
create an encryption standard that only they would break - that would
let them be both information assurance and signal intelligence."
Was Prism effectively a front for the more substantial fibre optic and
undersea cable tapping? Interviewing Gellman, Cory Doctorow said: "The
reason for Prism was to give them a plausible reason to know about the
things they knew from the fibre taps and not alerting the companies."
When Prism started Twitter barely existed, Facebook was limited to
college campuses and Google was tiny.
How did Snowden get the documents out?
Asked whether he has been harassed when writing about Snowden, Gellman said no.
"I have not been harassed. I've had some interesting exchanges with
government reps of various temperatures. But I speak to them before
every story. If they want to demonstrate falsity I want to hear it,
and if they want to tell me about specific damage I would be doing
then it want to hear that too. I get warnings about the espionage act
and I assume that I'm more interesting than I used to be. And Google
has warned me that they believe a state-sponsored hacker is attempting
to compromise my computer... I assume that is more likely to be a
foreign agency."
"Do I worry about doing harm and putting lives at risk? Of course I
do. There are things in the documents I don't think should be
published and there are things Snowden doesn't think should be
"He's a very smart guy on a lot of levels, and a very nimble mind.
There lots of boundaries he draws with me, and as a reporter I look
for side-channel attacks... Genghis Khan didn't try to known down the
Great Wall of China - he bribed the guards and put up ladders. But he
Snowden won't tell me how he got the documents out, for example."

list as false flag.  use it to grind some axes through
SUBQUANTUMSQUIRRELMESH cover and use pilfered bounty to bet against
the opers driving "perceived risk of running hidden site" to level
'wutsohigh'. then i'd use black funds stoking social media fire storm,
the righteous furor pre-disposing the public to zero sympathy for what
follows. nulling the meatbags simple as identities strategically
leaked for hidden disclosure service operators to "lower american
clandestine chemical cleaners" for prompt chemical dissolution. the
subsequent narco pulp tie up bolsters pre-seeded notions that said
"criminal hacker terrorists working for foreign intelligence services
conspiring to kill americans with logic bombs thrown from darknet
intertubes" deserved righteous death by sword clearly, if not for this
narco deal then surely for .
   finally, having driven the bounty on the hidden disclosure service
to an absurd level twice the GDP of china, i would dump and mix the
coins to a hidden wallet and disappear into history, never to be seen
or heard from again.
     TL;DR: the pot could be twice the GDP of china
       if the CIA is playing the game with us and feeling extra dirty.

ok. this is sounding like classic traffic analysis (on the "metadata"
rather than the content, so to speak).
Tor cells use padding, but this alone is not sufficient to defeat
traffic analysis.
this is why i am fond of everything dark!
namecoin to hidden services,
  no DNS, no plaintext.
(not entirely defeating QUATUMTHEORY, but much of it!)
the anonymity set is large, but maybe that isn't sufficient.
this is exactly the same argument for or against zero knowledge mixes.
sure, they offer stronger protection from traffic analysis, but the
anonymity set of users is tiny, making that theoretical hardness
useless in practical terms.
depending on where you stand, and what network you egress, it may make
absolutely perfect sense - Tor use alone drawing scrutiny that draws
from my personal experience, _not_ in places where Tor use alone is
suspect, it has been a essential tool.
if you're concerned about NSA/TAO/SSO then you're speaking of two
broad domains of concern:
1. pervasive, passive global intercept - this is where Tor and
encryption come in.  you've just made it harder, and turned something
global and passive ineffective, pushing activity toward:
2. tailored access - the black bag jobs, weaponized exploits, HUMINT
attacks, etc.  if you've pushed your adversary to these means, you've
achieved a COMSEC and symbolic victory.

speaking as a security enthusiasts and attending venues where hostile

1. Tor has worked in environments where no other communication could.
this includes situations where everything not-Tor was blocked or
actively attacked.  for this reason alone i believe it is an
indispensable tool in the security practitioner's toolbox.
2. Exit nodes should be considered hostile.  you'll be wrong most of
the time (by design) but it doesn't hurt to remember that plain-text
is not only observed but trivially manipulated through exit relays.
3. Defense in depth! Not only do 0day happen, but also accidents,
oversights, catastrophes, the slow march of time...  This can mean
running a live Tor distro like Tails or constructing a series of
isolated VMs for research on Qubes with a Tor Proxy VM.
as for the concerns about identifying Tor users, the latest Tor
bundles and Tails image have support for obfuscated proxies into the
Tor network and other bridges.  if Tor use alone is a concern, you're
doing OPSEC wrong and/or living where obfuscated proxies are

How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware
By Ryan Gallagher and Glenn Greenwald 12 Mar 2014, 9:19 AM EDT
Top-secret documents reveal that the National Security Agency is
dramatically expanding its ability to covertly hack into computers on
a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human
oversight in the process.
The classified files - provided previously by NSA whistleblower Edward
Snowden - contain new details about groundbreaking surveillance
technology the agency has developed to infect potentially millions of
computers worldwide with malware "implants." The clandestine
initiative enables the NSA to break into targeted computers and to
siphon out data from foreign Internet and phone networks.
The covert infrastructure that supports the hacking efforts operates
from the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, and from
eavesdropping bases in the United Kingdom and Japan. GCHQ, the British
intelligence agency, appears to have played an integral role in
helping to develop the implants tactic.
In some cases the NSA has masqueraded as a fake Facebook server, using
the social media site as a launching pad to infect a target's computer
and exfiltrate files from a hard drive. In others, it has sent out
spam emails laced with the malware, which can be tailored to covertly
record audio from a computer's microphone and take snapshots with its
webcam. The hacking systems have also enabled the NSA to launch
cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying
access to websites.
The implants being deployed were once reserved for a few hundred
hard-to-reach targets, whose communications could not be monitored
through traditional wiretaps. But the documents analyzed by The
Intercept show how the NSA has aggressively accelerated its hacking
initiatives in the past decade by computerizing some processes
previously handled by humans. The automated system - codenamed TURBINE
- is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large
size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated
control implants by groups instead of individually."
In a top-secret presentation, dated August 2009, the NSA describes a
pre-programmed part of the covert infrastructure called the "Expert
System," which is designed to operate "like the brain." The system
manages the applications and functions of the implants and "decides"
what tools they need to best extract data from infected machines.
Mikko Hypponen, an expert in malware who serves as chief research
officer at the Finnish security firm F-Secure, calls the revelations
"disturbing." The NSA's surveillance techniques, he warns, could
inadvertently be undermining the security of the Internet.
"When they deploy malware on systems," Hypponen says, "they
potentially create new vulnerabilities in these systems, making them
more vulnerable for attacks by third parties."
Hypponen believes that governments could arguably justify using
malware in a small number of targeted cases against adversaries. But
millions of malware implants being deployed by the NSA as part of an
automated process, he says, would be "out of control."
"That would definitely not be proportionate," Hypponen says. "It
couldn't possibly be targeted and named. It sounds like wholesale
infection and wholesale surveillance."
The NSA declined to answer questions about its deployment of implants,
pointing to a new presidential policy directive announced by President
Obama. "As the president made clear on 17 January," the agency said in
a statement, "signals intelligence shall be collected exclusively
where there is a foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purpose
to support national and departmental missions, and not for any other
"Owning the Net"
The NSA began rapidly escalating its hacking efforts a decade ago. In
2004, according to secret internal records, the agency was managing a
small network of only 100 to 150 implants. But over the next six to
eight years, as an elite unit called Tailored Access Operations (TAO)
recruited new hackers and developed new malware tools, the number of
implants soared to tens of thousands.
To penetrate foreign computer networks and monitor communications that
it did not have access to through other means, the NSA wanted to go
beyond the limits of traditional signals intelligence, or SIGINT, the
agency's term for the interception of electronic communications.
Instead, it sought to broaden "active" surveillance methods - tactics
designed to directly infiltrate a target's computers or network
In the documents, the agency describes such techniques as "a more
aggressive approach to SIGINT" and says that the TAO unit's mission is
to "aggressively scale" these operations.
But the NSA recognized that managing a massive network of implants is
too big a job for humans alone.
"One of the greatest challenges for active SIGINT/attack is scale,"
explains the top-secret presentation from 2009. "Human 'drivers' limit
ability for large-scale exploitation (humans tend to operate within
their own environment, not taking into account the bigger picture)."
The agency's solution was TURBINE. Developed as part of TAO unit, it
is described in the leaked documents as an "intelligent command and
control capability" that enables "industrial-scale exploitation."
TURBINE was designed to make deploying malware much easier for the
NSA's hackers by reducing their role in overseeing its functions. The
system would "relieve the user from needing to know/care about the
details," the NSA's Technology Directorate notes in one secret
document from 2009. "For example, a user should be able to ask for
'all details about application X' and not need to know how and where
the application keeps files, registry entries, user application data,
In practice, this meant that TURBINE would automate crucial processes
that previously had to be performed manually - including the
configuration of the implants as well as surveillance collection, or
"tasking," of data from infected systems. But automating these
processes was about much more than a simple technicality. The move
represented a major tactical shift within the NSA that was expected to
have a profound impact - allowing the agency to push forward into a
new frontier of surveillance operations.
The ramifications are starkly illustrated in one undated top-secret
NSA document, which describes how the agency planned for TURBINE to
"increase the current capability to deploy and manage hundreds of
Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA)
implants to potentially millions of implants." (CNE mines intelligence
from computers and networks; CNA seeks to disrupt, damage or destroy
Eventually, the secret files indicate, the NSA's plans for TURBINE
came to fruition. The system has been operational in some capacity
since at least July 2010, and its role has become increasingly central
to NSA hacking operations.
Earlier reports based on the Snowden files indicate that the NSA has
already deployed between 85,000 and 100,000 of its implants against
computers and networks across the world, with plans to keep on scaling
up those numbers.
The intelligence community's top-secret "Black Budget" for 2013,
obtained by Snowden, lists TURBINE as part of a broader NSA
surveillance initiative named "Owning the Net."
The agency sought $67.6 million in taxpayer funding for its Owning the
Net program last year. Some of the money was earmarked for TURBINE,
expanding the system to encompass "a wider variety" of networks and
"enabling greater automation of computer network exploitation."
Circumventing Encryption
The NSA has a diverse arsenal of malware tools, each highly
sophisticated and customizable for different purposes.
One implant, codenamed UNITEDRAKE, can be used with a variety of
"plug-ins" that enable the agency to gain total control of an infected
An implant plug-in named CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE, for example, is used to
take over a targeted computer's microphone and record conversations
taking place near the device. Another, GUMFISH, can covertly take over
a computer's webcam and snap photographs. FOGGYBOTTOM records logs of
Internet browsing histories and collects login details and passwords
used to access websites and email accounts. GROK is used to log
keystrokes. And SALVAGERABBIT exfiltrates data from removable flash
drives that connect to an infected computer.
The implants can enable the NSA to circumvent privacy-enhancing
encryption tools that are used to browse the Internet anonymously or
scramble the contents of emails as they are being sent across
networks. That's because the NSA's malware gives the agency unfettered
access to a target's computer before the user protects their
communications with encryption.
It is unclear how many of the implants are being deployed on an annual
basis or which variants of them are currently active in computer
systems across the world.
Previous reports have alleged that the NSA worked with Israel to
develop the Stuxnet malware, which was used to sabotage Iranian
nuclear facilities. The agency also reportedly worked with Israel to
deploy malware called Flame to infiltrate computers and spy on
communications in countries across the Middle East.
According to the Snowden files, the technology has been used to seek
out terror suspects as well as individuals regarded by the NSA as
"extremist." But the mandate of the NSA's hackers is not limited to
invading the systems of those who pose a threat to national security.
In one secret post on an internal message board, an operative from the
NSA's Signals Intelligence Directorate describes using malware attacks
against systems administrators who work at foreign phone and Internet
service providers. By hacking an administrator's computer, the agency
can gain covert access to communications that are processed by his
company. "Sys admins are a means to an end," the NSA operative writes.
The internal post - titled "I hunt sys admins" - makes clear that
terrorists aren't the only targets of such NSA attacks. Compromising a
systems administrator, the operative notes, makes it easier to get to
other targets of interest, including any "government official that
happens to be using the network some admin takes care of."
Similar tactics have been adopted by Government Communications
Headquarters, the NSA's British counterpart. As the German newspaper
Der Spiegel reported in September, GCHQ hacked computers belonging to
network engineers at Belgacom, the Belgian telecommunications
The mission, codenamed "Operation Socialist," was designed to enable
GCHQ to monitor mobile phones connected to Belgacom's network. The
secret files deem the mission a "success," and indicate that the
agency had the ability to covertly access Belgacom's systems since at
least 2010.
Infiltrating cellphone networks, however, is not all that the malware
can be used to accomplish. The NSA has specifically tailored some of
its implants to infect large-scale network routers used by Internet
service providers in foreign countries. By compromising routers - the
devices that connect computer networks and transport data packets
across the Internet - the agency can gain covert access to monitor
Internet traffic, record the browsing sessions of users, and intercept
Two implants the NSA injects into network routers, HAMMERCHANT and
HAMMERSTEIN, help the agency to intercept and perform "exploitation
attacks" against data that is sent through a Virtual Private Network,
a tool that uses encrypted "tunnels" to enhance the security and
privacy of an Internet session.
The implants also track phone calls sent across the network via Skype
and other Voice Over IP software, revealing the username of the person
making the call. If the audio of the VOIP conversation is sent over
the Internet using unencrypted "Real-time Transport Protocol" packets,
the implants can covertly record the audio data and then return it to
the NSA for analysis.
But not all of the NSA's implants are used to gather intelligence, the
secret files show. Sometimes, the agency's aim is disruption rather
than surveillance. QUANTUMSKY, a piece of NSA malware developed in
2004, is used to block targets from accessing certain websites.
QUANTUMCOPPER, first tested in 2008, corrupts a target's file
downloads. These two "attack" techniques are revealed on a classified
list that features nine NSA hacking tools, six of which are used for
intelligence gathering. Just one is used for "defensive" purposes - to
protect U.S. government networks against intrusions.
"Mass exploitation potential"
Before it can extract data from an implant or use it to attack a
system, the NSA must first install the malware on a targeted computer
or network.
According to one top-secret document from 2012, the agency can deploy
malware by sending out spam emails that trick targets into clicking a
malicious link. Once activated, a "back-door implant" infects their
computers within eight seconds.
There's only one problem with this tactic, codenamed WILLOWVIXEN:
According to the documents, the spam method has become less successful
in recent years, as Internet users have become wary of unsolicited
emails and less likely to click on anything that looks suspicious.
Consequently, the NSA has turned to new and more advanced hacking
techniques. These include performing so-called "man-in-the-middle" and
"man-on-the-side" attacks, which covertly force a user's internet
browser to route to NSA computer servers that try to infect them with
an implant.
To perform a man-on-the-side attack, the NSA observes a target's
Internet traffic using its global network of covert "accesses" to data
as it flows over fiber optic cables or satellites. When the target
visits a website that the NSA is able to exploit, the agency's
surveillance sensors alert the TURBINE system, which then "shoots"
data packets at the targeted computer's IP address within a fraction
of a second.
In one man-on-the-side technique, codenamed QUANTUMHAND, the agency
disguises itself as a fake Facebook server. When a target attempts to
log in to the social media site, the NSA transmits malicious data
packets that trick the target's computer into thinking they are being
sent from the real Facebook. By concealing its malware within what
looks like an ordinary Facebook page, the NSA is able to hack into the
targeted computer and covertly siphon out data from its hard drive. A
top-secret animation demonstrates the tactic in action.
The documents show that QUANTUMHAND became operational in October
2010, after being successfully tested by the NSA against about a dozen
According to Matt Blaze, a surveillance and cryptography expert at the
University of Pennsylvania, it appears that the QUANTUMHAND technique
is aimed at targeting specific individuals. But he expresses concerns
about how it has been covertly integrated within Internet networks as
part of the NSA's automated TURBINE system.
"As soon as you put this capability in the backbone infrastructure,
the software and security engineer in me says that's terrifying,"
Blaze says.
"Forget about how the NSA is intending to use it. How do we know it is
working correctly and only targeting who the NSA wants? And even if it
does work correctly, which is itself a really dubious assumption, how
is it controlled?"
In an email statement to The Intercept, Facebook spokesman Jay
Nancarrow said the company had "no evidence of this alleged activity."
He added that Facebook implemented HTTPS encryption for users last
year, making browsing sessions less vulnerable to malware attacks.
Nancarrow also pointed out that other services besides Facebook could
have been compromised by the NSA. "If government agencies indeed have
privileged access to network service providers," he said, "any site
running only [unencrypted] HTTP could conceivably have its traffic
A man-in-the-middle attack is a similar but slightly more aggressive
method that can be used by the NSA to deploy its malware. It refers to
a hacking technique in which the agency covertly places itself between
computers as they are communicating with each other.
This allows the NSA not only to observe and redirect browsing
sessions, but to modify the content of data packets that are passing
between computers.
The man-in-the-middle tactic can be used, for instance, to covertly
change the content of a message as it is being sent between two
people, without either knowing that any change has been made by a
third party. The same technique is sometimes used by criminal hackers
to defraud people.
A top-secret NSA presentation from 2012 reveals that the agency
developed a man-in-the-middle capability called SECONDDATE to
"influence real-time communications between client and server" and to
"quietly redirect web-browsers" to NSA malware servers called FOXACID.
In October, details about the FOXACID system were reported by the
Guardian, which revealed its links to attacks against users of the
Internet anonymity service Tor.
But SECONDDATE is tailored not only for "surgical" surveillance
attacks on individual suspects. It can also be used to launch bulk
malware attacks against computers.
According to the 2012 presentation, the tactic has "mass exploitation
potential for clients passing through network choke points."
Blaze, the University of Pennsylvania surveillance expert, says the
potential use of man-in-the-middle attacks on such a scale "seems very
disturbing." Such an approach would involve indiscriminately
monitoring entire networks as opposed to targeting individual
"The thing that raises a red flag for me is the reference to 'network
choke points,'" he says. "That's the last place that we should be
allowing intelligence agencies to compromise the infrastructure -
because that is by definition a mass surveillance technique."
To deploy some of its malware implants, the NSA exploits security
vulnerabilities in commonly used Internet browsers such as Mozilla
Firefox and Internet Explorer.
The agency's hackers also exploit security weaknesses in network
routers and in popular software plugins such as Flash and Java to
deliver malicious code onto targeted machines.
The implants can circumvent anti-virus programs, and the NSA has gone
to extreme lengths to ensure that its clandestine technology is
extremely difficult to detect. An implant named VALIDATOR, used by the
NSA to upload and download data to and from an infected machine, can
be set to self-destruct - deleting itself from an infected computer
after a set time expires.
In many cases, firewalls and other security measures do not appear to
pose much of an obstacle to the NSA. Indeed, the agency's hackers
appear confident in their ability to circumvent any security mechanism
that stands between them and compromising a computer or network. "If
we can get the target to visit us in some sort of web browser, we can
probably own them," an agency hacker boasts in one secret document.
"The only limitation is the 'how.'"
Covert Infrastructure
The TURBINE implants system does not operate in isolation.
It is linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine
surveillance "sensors" that the agency has installed at locations
across the world.
The NSA's headquarters in Maryland are part of this network, as are
eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith
Hill, England.
The sensors, codenamed TURMOIL, operate as a sort of high-tech
surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent
across the Internet.
When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems,
the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to
the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL
system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the
initiation of a malware attack.
The NSA identifies surveillance targets based on a series of data
"selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors,
according to internal documents, can include email addresses, IP
addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other
identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites
such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter.
Other selectors the NSA uses can be gleaned from unique Google
advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key
fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs
that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or
What's more, the TURBINE system operates with the knowledge and
support of other governments, some of which have participated in the
malware attacks.
Classification markings on the Snowden documents indicate that NSA has
shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts
in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance - the United Kingdom,
Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.
GCHQ, the British agency, has taken on a particularly important role
in helping to develop the malware tactics. The Menwith Hill satellite
eavesdropping base that is part of the TURMOIL network, located in a
rural part of Northern England, is operated by the NSA in close
cooperation with GCHQ.
Top-secret documents show that the British base - referred to by the
NSA as "MHS" for Menwith Hill Station - is an integral component of
the TURBINE malware infrastructure and has been used to experiment
with implant "exploitation" attacks against users of Yahoo and
In one document dated 2010, at least five variants of the QUANTUM
hacking method were listed as being "operational" at Menwith Hill. The
same document also reveals that GCHQ helped integrate three of the
QUANTUM malware capabilities - and test two others - as part of a
surveillance system it operates codenamed INSENSER.
GCHQ cooperated with the hacking attacks despite having reservations
about their legality. One of the Snowden files, previously disclosed
by Swedish broadcaster SVT, revealed that as recently as April 2013,
GCHQ was apparently reluctant to get involved in deploying the QUANTUM
malware due to "legal/policy restrictions." A representative from a
unit of the British surveillance agency, meeting with an obscure
telecommunications standards committee in 2010, separately voiced
concerns that performing "active" hacking attacks for surveillance
"may be illegal" under British law.
In response to questions from The Intercept, GCHQ refused to comment
on its involvement in the covert hacking operations. Citing its
boilerplate response to inquiries, the agency said in a statement that
"all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal
and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorized,
necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight."
Whatever the legalities of the United Kingdom and United States
infiltrating computer networks, the Snowden files bring into sharp
focus the broader implications. Under cover of secrecy and without
public debate, there has been an unprecedented proliferation of
aggressive surveillance techniques. One of the NSA's primary concerns,
in fact, appears to be that its clandestine tactics are now being
adopted by foreign rivals, too.
"Hacking routers has been good business for us and our 5-eyes partners
for some time," notes one NSA analyst in a top-secret document dated
December 2012. "But it is becoming more apparent that other nation
states are honing their skillz [sic] and joining the scene."

can such a tasking pass my PCI PA-DSS audit for me??
"Imagine a master list of all admins of all networks on earth..."
'Inside the NSA's Secret Efforts to Hunt and Hack System Administrators'
 -    also, slides:
      Across the world, people who work as system administrators keep
computer networks in order - and this has turned them into unwitting
targets of the National Security Agency for simply doing their jobs.
According to a secret document provided by NSA whistleblower Edward
Snowden, the agency tracks down the private email and Facebook
accounts of system administrators (or sys admins, as they are often
called), before hacking their computers to gain access to the networks
they control.
The document consists of several posts - one of them is titled "I hunt
sys admins" - that were published in 2012 on an internal discussion
board hosted on the agency's classified servers. They were written by
an NSA official involved in the agency's effort to break into foreign
network routers, the devices that connect computer networks and
transport data across the Internet. By infiltrating the computers of
system administrators who work for foreign phone and Internet
companies, the NSA can gain access to the calls and emails that flow
over their networks.
The classified posts reveal how the NSA official aspired to create a
database that would function as an international hit list of sys
admins to potentially target. Yet the document makes clear that the
admins are not suspected of any criminal activity - they are targeted
only because they control access to networks the agency wants to
infiltrate. "Who better to target than the person that already has the
'keys to the kingdom'?" one of the posts says.
The NSA wants more than just passwords. The document includes a list
of other data that can be harvested from computers belonging to sys
admins, including network maps, customer lists, business
correspondence and, the author jokes, "pictures of cats in funny poses
with amusing captions." The posts, boastful and casual in tone,
contain hacker jargon  (pwn, skillz, zomg, internetz) and are
punctuated with expressions of mischief. "Current mood: devious,"
reads one, while another signs off, "Current mood: scheming."
The author of the posts, whose name is being withheld by The
Intercept, is a network specialist in the agency's Signals
Intelligence Directorate, according to other NSA documents. The same
author wrote secret presentations related to the NSA's controversial
program to identify users of the Tor browser - a privacy-enhancing
tool that allows people to browse the Internet anonymously. The
network specialist, who served as a private contractor prior to
joining the NSA, shows little respect for hackers who do not work for
the government. One post expresses disdain for the quality of
presentations at Blackhat and Defcon, the computer world's premier
security and hacker conferences:
It is unclear how precise the NSA's hacking attacks are or how the
agency ensures that it excludes Americans from the intrusions. The
author explains in one post that the NSA scours the Internet to find
people it deems "probable" administrators, suggesting a lack of
certainty in the process and implying that the wrong person could be
targeted. It is illegal for the NSA to deliberately target Americans
for surveillance without explicit prior authorization. But the
employee's posts make no mention of any measures that might be taken
to prevent hacking the computers of Americans who work as sys admins
for foreign networks. Without such measures, Americans who work on
such networks could potentially fall victim to an NSA infiltration
The NSA declined to answer questions about its efforts to hack system
administrators or explain how it ensures Americans are not mistakenly
targeted. Agency spokeswoman Vanee' Vines said in an email statement:
"A key part of the protections that apply to both U.S. persons and
citizens of other countries is the mandate that information be in
support of a valid foreign intelligence requirement, and comply with
U.S. Attorney General-approved procedures to protect privacy rights."
As The Intercept revealed last week, clandestine hacking has become
central to the NSA's mission in the past decade. The agency is working
to aggressively scale its ability to break into computers to perform
what it calls "computer network exploitation," or CNE: the collection
of intelligence from covertly infiltrated computer systems. Hacking
into the computers of sys admins is particularly controversial because
unlike conventional targets - people who are regarded as threats - sys
admins are not suspected of any wrongdoing.
In a post calling sys admins "a means to an end," the NSA employee
writes, "Up front, sys admins generally are not my end target. My end
target is the extremist/terrorist or government official that happens
to be using the network some admin takes care of."
The first step, according to the posts, is to collect IP addresses
that are believed to be linked to a network's sys admin. An IP address
is a series of numbers allocated to every computer that connects to
the Internet. Using this identifier, the NSA can then run an IP
address through the vast amount of signals intelligence data, or
SIGINT, that it collects every day, trying to match the IP address to
personal accounts.
"What we'd really like is a personal webmail or Facebook account to
target," one of the posts explains, presumably because, whereas IP
addresses can be shared by multiple people, "alternative selectors"
like a webmail or Facebook account can be linked to a particular
target. You can "dumpster-dive for alternate selectors in the big
SIGINT trash can" the author suggests. Or "pull out your wicked
Google-fu" (slang for efficient Googling) to search for any "official
and non-official e-mails" that the targets may have posted online.
Once the agency believes it has identified a sys admin's personal
accounts, according to the posts, it can target them with its
so-called QUANTUM hacking techniques. The Snowden files reveal that
the QUANTUM methods have been used to secretly inject surveillance
malware into a Facebook page by sending malicious NSA data packets
that appear to originate from a genuine Facebook server. This method
tricks a target's computer into accepting the malicious packets,
allowing the NSA to infect the targeted computer with a malware
"implant" and gain unfettered access to the data stored on its hard
"Just pull those selectors, queue them up for QUANTUM, and proceed
with the pwnage," the author of the posts writes. ("Pwnage," short for
"pure ownage," is gamer-speak for defeating opponents.) The author
adds, triumphantly, "Yay! /throws confetti in the air."
In one case, these tactics were used by the NSA's British counterpart,
Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, to infiltrate the
Belgian telecommunications company Belgacom. As Der Speigel revealed
last year, Belgacom's network engineers were targeted by GCHQ in a
QUANTUM mission named "Operation Socialist" - with the British agency
hacking into the company's systems in an effort to monitor
While targeting innocent sys admins may be surprising on its own, the
"hunt sys admins" document reveals how the NSA network specialist
secretly discussed building a "master list" of sys admins across the
world, which would enable an attack to be initiated on one of them the
moment their network was thought to be used by a person of interest.
One post outlines how this process would make it easier for the NSA's
specialist hacking unit, Tailored Access Operations (TAO), to
infiltrate networks and begin collecting, or "tasking," data:
Aside from offering up thoughts on covert hacking tactics, the author
of these posts also provides a glimpse into internal employee
complaints at the NSA. The posts describe how the agency's spies gripe
about having "dismal infrastructure" and a "Big Data Problem" because
of the massive volume of information being collected by NSA
surveillance systems. For the author, however, the vast data troves
are actually something to be enthusiastic about.
"Our ability to pull bits out of random places of the Internet, bring
them back to the mother-base to evaluate and build intelligence off of
is just plain awesome!" the author writes. "One of the coolest things
about it is how much data we have at our fingertips."

reification requested!
Here's a concrete suggestion, which I'll call NTRU Prime, for
eliminating the structures that I find worrisome in existing
ideal-lattice-based encryption systems. This suggestion uses a number
field of prime degree, so that the only subfield is Q; and uses an
irreducible polynomial xp-x-1 with a very large Galois group, so that
the number field is very far from having automorphisms. The best CVP
dimension seems to be about half the degree; this is optimal for
number fields without many real embeddings. (It's hard to create many
real embeddings while keeping coefficients small, and if coefficients
are large then there are other problems.) This suggestion also chooses
its modulus q so that (Z/q)[x]/(xp-x-1) is a field; this
simultaneously avoids (1) NTRU's traditional 2-adic structure and (2)
the linear splittings used in most recent papers.

"if the intelligence community thinks that the controversy over our
legacy of torture is just the result of some silly girlish feelings,
then we haven't even begun to deal with the consequences of those
Who's "Emotional"-- Feinstein or the C.I.A.?
Who gets "emotional" about torture--or, rather, what is the proper
emotional response to a history of torture and lies? On Fox News, on
Sunday morning, Chris Wallace asked Michael Hayden, the former
director of the C.I.A., about a report by the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence, sixty-three hundred pages long, that "says the C.I.A.
misled the public about the severity and the success of the enhanced
interrogation program." Hayden's first response was to talk about the
feelings of Dianne Feinstein, the chair of the committee, citing an
article by David Ignatius: "He said Senator Feinstein wanted a report
so scathing that it would 'ensure that an un-American brutal program
of detention and interrogation would never again be considered or
permitted.' "
Now, that sentence, that motivation for the report, Chris, may show
deep emotional feeling on part of the senator. But I don't think it
leads you to an objective report.
"Deep emotional feelings," on the part of a woman like Feinstein, are
apparently dizzying, especially when it comes to things like our
integrity as a nation. But are Hayden and his former colleagues at the
C.I.A., in touch with their own emotions on this one? The Senate voted
on Thursday to submit the report for declassification; this process
may take a while, because the White House and the C.I.A. will be
involved, and the agency has fought the report. It has made its
objections known feelingly, in a rebuttal that is also classified, in
testimony, and in leaks to reporters about how the Senate just doesn't
understand what it was like--doesn't get it, doesn't care about what
bad days its agents had. Not that the C.I.A. wants to tell. When John
Brennan, the current head of the C.I.A., realized that the Senate
investigators had some of the agency's notes to itself--the so-called
Panetta papers, in which, according to Senator Feinstein, the agency
conceded points it is now denying--he had a bit of a fit. Feinstein
said that the committee got the Panetta papers from the C.I.A. in a
document dump; the agency said that even if it did, the committee
ought to have known that those notes were private. It apparently
searched the Senate's computers and tried to get a criminal
investigation started. Calling the cops is, admittedly, a common
fantasy when an teen-ager realizes that his journal has been read, but
it's a bit unworthy of an intelligence agency when dealing with its
congressional overseers.
Now, not that there's anything wrong with wanting a scathing report in
torture that will shock the conscience, but it's probably worth noting
that the Ignatius line Hayden cited took a Feinstein quote slightly
out of context. (Though the layering of emotionalism is on Hayden.)
Ignatius wrote that Feinstein "wanted a report so tough that it would
'ensure that an un-American, brutal program of detention and
interrogation will never again be considered or permitted,' as she put
it." She had actually presented this as the reason to make the report
If the Senate can declassify this report, we will be able to ensure
that an un-American, brutal program of detention and interrogation
will never again be considered or permitted.
Emphasis added. It's a fine distinction, but an important one:
whatever her "motivation" was, it didn't shape the writing of the
report, but her feelings about who ought to get to read it. (On
Saturday, Trevor Timm, of the Press Freedom Foundation, put out a
"general plea" for a leak.)
There are really two issues here. One is the reflexive tendency to
disparage or dismiss a woman in politics (or in business, or anywhere)
with a remark about her supposed susceptibility to emotion. The other
is the way a certain femininity--the wilting kind--is ascribed to those
who doubt that torture is good for America.
The cartoon is of the clear-headed torturer who has put tenderness
aside for the sake of country, against the squeamish, sensitive,
can't-handle-the-truth doubters. The supposed contrast is between
focussed, rational realism and a tendency to faint. (Men and women can
be put in either role, as in "Zero Dark Thirty.") But fear and a
desire to punish, which disabled the judgments of many in the
government after 9/11, are emotions, too, and even harder to control
than, say, mercy. So is a fascination with one's own power to protect
or, less charitably, one's self-imagined ruthlessness. So is a
tendency to be charmed by dark sides. One can argue that those who
turn to the law or a moral code, in moments of crisis, can be the
least flushed by feeling. That is not to make a case against inserting
feeling into politics: righteous indignation and kindness can anchor,
rather than discombobulate. It might be most accurate to say that
various emotions serve us differently. They wake us up, and, when they
do, in what can be an outraged, bleary-eyed moment, we should be
careful about what we reach for.
And if the intelligence community thinks that the controversy over our
legacy of torture is just the result of some silly girlish feelings,
then we haven't even begun to deal with the consequences of those
There is another powerful emotion that may be at work here: shame. One
source of C.I.A.'s anxiety about the Senate report is that it
apparently casts a cold eye on the effectiveness of torture. It didn't
do us much good, apparently. Perhaps it is painful to have compromised
one's principles and not brought back anything good. But that
psychological exploration should not take place entirely in classified
About the same time that Hayden was on Fox News, Nancy Pelosi was on
CNN, talking to Candy Crowley about the same report. Crowley asked if
she blamed senior C.I.A. officials for the "misrepresentations" about
torture; Pelosi went a level higher, to make a point about
institutional culture, and one of our more fundamental emotions--the
desire for praise. "Many people in the C.I.A. are so patriotic,
they--they protect our country in a way to avoid conflict and--and, uh,

Frankencert - Adversarial Testing of Certificate Validation in SSL/TLS
What are frankencerts?
Frankencerts are specially crafted SSL certificates for testing
certificate validation code in SSL/TLS implementations. The technique
is described in detail in the 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and
Privacy (Oakland) paper - Using Frankencerts for Automated Adversarial
Testing of Certificate Validation in SSL/TLS Implementations by Chad
Brubaker, Suman Jana, Baishakhi Ray, Sarfraz Khurshid, and Vitaly
Why is frankencert generator useful?
Frankencert generator is essentially a smart fuzzer for testing
SSL/TLS certificate validation code. If you are a developer who is
implementing any sort of SSL/TLS certificate validation code (either
as part of an SSL/TLS library or an application), you can use the
frankencert generator to auto-generate different test certificates
involving complex corner cases.
We have successfully used frankencerts to find serious vulnerabilities
in GnuTLS, PolarSSL, CyaSSL, and MatrixSSL as described in our Oakland
2014 paper. We also found several discrepancies between how different
SSL/TLS implementations report errors back to the user. For example,
when presented with an expired, self-signed certificate, NSS, Chrome
on Linux, and Safari report that the certificate has expired but not
that the issuer is invalid.
How do frankencerts work?
The basic idea of frankencerts is to take a bunch of certificates as
seeds and use random mutations on different fields and extensions to
create new test certificates (frankencerts). Using frankencerts as
server-side inputs into an SSL/TLS handshake can help systematically
test correctness of the certificate validation code.
Installation and Usage
Install OpenSSL libraries and utilities if you don't have them already.
The frankencert generator needs a modified version of PyOpenSSL. We
have included the source for our modified version of PyOpenSSL. You
will need to install it in order to use the frankencert generator.
First, uninstall any other version of PyOpenSSL that you may have
installed on your computer. Go to the pyOpenSSL-0.13 directory and
build/install PyOpenSSL by issuing sudo python setup.py install.
Once you have the patched pyOpenSSL set up, to generate frankencerts,
use the franken_generate.py script: python franken_generate.py
seed_certs_dir ca_cert output_dir count [config_file].
The arguments are explained below.
seed_certs_dir: Frankencert generator needs a set of seed
certificates. Any SSL cert in PEM fromat can act as a seed cert.
seed_certs_dir can be any directory containing the seed certs stored
as PEM files.
You can either use tools like ZMap ( to collect SSL
seed certificates, or use some of the SSL certs available from
 Please note that these are not our
tools and repositories - you may want to contact their respective
developers and maintainers to ensure that your usage of the
certificates they collected is compatible with the intended purpose.
You do not need access to the corresponding private keys to use the
certs as seeds.
For your convenience, we have included a tarball containing around
1000 seed certificates in utils/sample_seed_certs.tar.gz.
ca_cert: You will also need to create a self-signed CA certificate to
sign the frankencerts. You can either use the included sample CA
certificate utils/rootCA_key_cert.pem or use the
utils/create_new_ca.sh script to create your own root CA. For any root
CA that you use for frankencert generation, make sure that your SSL
certificate validation code treats its certificate as a trusted root
VERY IMPORTANT: this root certificate should be trusted ONLY during
testing. If you accidentally or intentionally deploy SSL/TLS with this
certificate still among the trusted root certificates, your SSL/TLS
connections may be vulnerable to server impersonation and
man-in-the-middle attacks. Be sure to REMOVE this certificate from
your trusted root certificates once the testing is finished.
output_dir: It will contain the generated frankencerts. The
frankencerts will be named as frankencert-.pem.
count: Number of frankencerts to be generated.
config_file: An optional argument to tune the frankencert generation
process. Take a look at the utils/sample_franken.conf for a sample
config file.
To test your SSL/TLS client with the generated frankencerts, you
should use the utils/test_ssl_server.py script to set up an SSL server
that can present the generated frankencerts as part of the SSL
Project structure
The frankengen directory contains the frankencert generator code
Our patched version of pyOpenSSL is inside pyOpenSSL-0.13 directory
Several useful tools are included in utils
cert_print.py: a tool for printing frankencerts. It requires OpenSSL
to be installed and present in the path.
rootCA_key_cert.pem: private key and self-signed cert of a sample CA
that can be used for signing frankencerts.
create_new_ca.sh: a script for creating new CA with a self-signed
cert. It creates the output cert and private key in rootCA.pem
(requires OpenSSL).
test_ssl_server.py: a sample SSL/TLS server for presenting
frankencerts to SSL/TLS clients
sample_seed_certs.tar.gz: Some sample certs that may be used as seeds
for frankencert generation.
sample_franken.conf: A sample config file that can be used to tune
different parameters of the frankencert generation process.

my only comment, for now:
Five years ago, Kelly Ziegler calculated that patching a fully

of the size of the per-node firmware relative to the available
powerline bandwidth.
this does not take into consideration the "truck roll" option.  it's
the network operator's worst nightmare; an option of last resort.
the majority of smart grid devices i have analyzed contain both
optical and higher speed radio interfaces which may be accessed by a
technician on site or near by.  much more expensive than the slow
trickle broadcast, but to claim a critical fix could be deployed only
via one method is a bit misleading.
p.s. hacking these devices still an undiscovered country!  has your

I wasn't first to get the key. Nor was I second, third, or even
fourth. I'm probably not even the
10th to get it. But I'm happy that I was able to prove to myself that
I too could do it.
The sleepless adventure began yesterday afternoon, 2014-04-12
15:19:04.827516279 -0700.
First, I have to admit I was a skeptic. Like the handful of other
dissenters, I had initially
believed that it would be highly improbable under normal conditions to
obtain the private key
through exploiting Heartbleed. So this was my motivation for
participating in Cloudflare's
challenge. I had extracted a lot of other things with Heartbleed, but
I hadn't actually set out to
extract private keys. So I wanted to see first-hand if it was possible or not.
I started by hastily modifying the hb-test.py that everyone has been
using to dump the raw memory
contents to a file, rather than print a hexdump. I then left this
running in the background for a
(very long) while, as I set off to think of an approach.
    while true; do python hb-raw.py  done
My original thinking was that I could get a large sample of memory,
then use some forensic analysis
tools to search for keys in the memory dump. This idea went to the
wayside, however, as I got
sidetracked when I started seeing "BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY" strings in
the script output.
    I thought it was too good to be true, but after parsing it out, it was
indeed a valid private key,
so I submitted it -- unsuccessfully. This turned out to be the work of
trolls who were sending
private key contents in heartbeat requests to the server, and I fell
for the trollbait. I found
several more `private keys' in the dump, and I skeptically tested them
anyway, just in case. But
they were all fake as well. Fucking trolls. But at least I didn't fall
for any of the keys that
ended in "LOLJK" ;)
So, I decided to get back on track and stick to my original plan.
After searching through some
forensics mailing lists and reading some papers on the topic, my plan
was to parse my dump file,
looking for the start of a key in ASN.1 format ("\x30\x82"), and then
parse out the key from there.
While working on this approach, I had a conversation with Brandon
Enright ( on IRC. This
conversation left me thinking that my approach won't work, because the
chances of the key being in
ASN.1 DER format in memory are about as slim as the key being in PEM
format in memory. Brandon,
however, suggested a much more reasonable approach:
(19:25:15) < bmenrigh> But my plan would be to interpret all possible
portions of the memory dump
as however the P and Q factors get encoded and then just trial divide
the N modulus from the SSL
cert until you get one that divides
(19:26:38) < bmenrigh> you only get up to about 64k of memory on each
grab so if you interpret
every offset as the start of the dump as whatever a private key looks
like it just isn't many trial
By this time though, I had already been working on this for several
hours, and it was Friday night,
so I didn't want to spend any more time on it. However, I gave it some
more thought over dinner,
and the more I drank, the more I realized it was far more likely that
the binary values of p, or q,
or both, were in memory as-is. They likely wouldn't be encoded at all,
so we can just shift through
the memory dump in $keysize chunks, converting them to bignums and
doing the trial divide as Brandon
suggested. This would be really easy to code up and test, so I decided
to call it an early night,
and rushed home to work on it while the thought (and the liquor) were
still fresh in my brain.
The version of hb-test.py that I already had running in the background
was dumping memory in 16 KiB
chunks, not the full 64 KiB, so the plan would be to read the memory
dump in 16 KiB chunks,
shifting through each chunk in $keysize sections, testing to see if we
have a prime that the
modulus is divisible by. I sketched out the following psuedocode:

    {
        for (offset = 0; offset < len(chunk)-keysize; offset++)
        {
                p = bignum (chunk[offset-1] .. chunk[offset+keysize-1])
                if (p is prime and modulus % p == 0)

                        q = modulus / p;
                        print p, q;
                }
        }
    }
After a few hours of testing and debugging, lo and behold, one of the
primes is in my dump. Several
times, even. From here, it is trivial to get the private key given p/q
and the modulus.

-1)]).strip(), 16)
                                if gmpy.is_prime (p) and p != n and n % p == 0:

Exclusive: Emails reveal close Google relationship with NSA
National Security Agency head and Internet giantâs executives have
coordinated through high-level policy discussions
May 6, 2014 5:00AM ET
by Jason Leopold Email exchanges between National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith
Alexander and Google executives Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt suggest a
far cozier working relationship between some tech firms and the U.S.
government than was implied by Silicon Valley brass after last yearâs
revelations about NSA spying.
Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about the agencyâs
vast capability for spying on Americansâ electronic communications
prompted a number of tech executives whose firms cooperated with the
government to insist they had done so only when compelled by a court
of law.
But Al Jazeera has obtained two sets of email communications dating
from a year before Snowden became a household name that suggest not
all cooperation was under pressure.
On the morning of June 28, 2012, an email from Alexander invited
Schmidt to attend a four-hour-long âclassified threat briefingâ on
Aug. 8 at a âsecure facility in proximity to the San Jose, CA
âThe meeting discussion will be topic-specific, and decision-oriented,
with a focus on Mobility Threats and Security,â Alexander wrote in the
email, obtained under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the
first of dozens of communications between the NSA chief and Silicon
Valley executives that the agency plans to turn over.
Alexander, Schmidt and other industry executives met earlier in the
month, according to the email. But Alexander wanted another meeting
with Schmidt and âa small group of CEOsâ later that summer because the
government needed Silicon Valleyâs help.
âAbout six months ago, we began focusing on the security of mobility
devices,â Alexander wrote. âA group (primarily Google, Apple and
Microsoft) recently came to agreement on a set of core security
principles. When we reach this point in our projects we schedule a
classified briefing for the CEOs of key companies to provide them a
brief on the specific threats we believe can be mitigated and to seek
their commitment for their organization to move ahead â¦ Googleâs
participation in refinement, engineering and deployment of the
solutions will be essential.â
Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at Stanford Law Schoolâs
Center for Internet and Society, said she believes information sharing
between industry and the government is âabsolutely essentialâ but âat
the same time, there is some risk to user privacy and to user security
from the way the vulnerability disclosure is done.â
The challenge facing government and industry was to enhance security
without compromising privacy, Granick said. The emails between
Alexander and Google executives, she said, show âhow informal
information sharing has been happening within this vacuum where there
hasnât been a known, transparent, concrete, established methodology
for getting security information into the right hands.â
The classified briefing cited by Alexander was part of a secretive
government initiative known as the Enduring Security Framework (ESF),
and his email provides some rare information about what the ESF
entails, the identities of some participant tech firms and the threats
they discussed.
The classified briefing cited by Alexander was part of a secretive
government initiative known as the Enduring Security Framework (ESF),
and his email provides some rare information about what the ESF
entails, the identity of some participant tech firms and the threats
they discussed.
Alexander explained that the deputy secretaries of the Department of
Defense, Homeland Security and â18 US CEOsâ launched the ESF in 2009
to âcoordinate government/industry actions on important (generally
classified) security issues that couldnât be solved by individual
actors alone.â
âFor example, over the last 18 months, we (primarily Intel, AMD
[Advanced Micro Devices], HP [Hewlett-Packard], Dell and Microsoft on
the industry side) completed an effort to secure the BIOS of
enterprise platforms to address a threat in that area.â
âBIOSâ is an acronym for âbasic input/output system,â the system
software that initializes the hardware in a personal computer before
the operating system starts up. NSA cyberdefense chief Debora Plunkett
in December disclosed that the agency had thwarted a âBIOS plotâ by a
ânation-state,â identified as China, to brick U.S. computers. That
plot, she said, could have destroyed the U.S. economy. â60 Minutes,â
which broke the story, reported that the NSA worked with unnamed
âcomputer manufacturersâ to address the BIOS software vulnerability.
But some cybersecurity experts questioned the scenario outlined by Plunkett.
âThere is probably some real event behind this, but itâs hard to tell,
because we donât have any details,â wrote Robert Graham, CEO of the
penetration-testing firm Errata Security in Atlanta, on his blog in
December. âItâs completely false in the message it is trying to
convey. What comes out is gibberish, as any technical person can
And by enlisting the NSA to shore up their defenses, those companies
may have made themselves more vulnerable to the agencyâs efforts to
breach them for surveillance purposes.
âI think the public should be concerned about whether the NSA was
really making its best efforts, as the emails claim, to help secure
enterprise BIOS and mobile devices and not holding the best
vulnerabilities close to their chest,â said Nate Cardozo, a staff
attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundationâs digital civil
liberties team.
He doesnât doubt that the NSA was trying to secure enterprise BIOS,
but he suggested that the agency, for its own purposes, was âlooking
for weaknesses in the exact same products theyâre trying to secure.â
The NSA âhas no business helping Google secure its facilities from the
Chinese and at the same time hacking in through the back doors and
tapping the fiber connections between Google base centers,â Cardozo
said. âThe fact that itâs the same agency doing both of those things
is in obvious contradiction and ridiculous.â He recommended dividing
offensive and defensive functions between two agencies.

Two weeks after the â60 Minutesâ broadcast, the German magazine Der
Spiegel, citing documents obtained by Snowden, reported that the NSA
inserted back doors into BIOS, doing exactly what Plunkett accused a
nation-state of doing during her interview.
Googleâs Schmidt was unable to attend to the mobility security meeting
in San Jose in August 2012.
âGeneral Keith.. so great to see you.. !â Schmidt wrote. âIâm unlikely
to be in California that week so Iâm sorry I canât attend (will be on
the east coast). Would love to see you another time. Thank you !â
Since the Snowden disclosures, Schmidt has been critical of the NSA
and said its surveillance programs may be illegal.
Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
did attend that briefing. Foreign Policy reported a month later that
Dempsey and other government officials â no mention of Alexander â
were in Silicon Valley âpicking the brains of leaders throughout the
valley and discussing the need to quickly share information on cyber
threats.â Foreign Policy noted that the Silicon Valley executives in
attendance belonged to the ESF. The story did not say mobility threats
and security was the top agenda item along with a classified threat
A week after the gathering, Dempsey said during a Pentagon press
briefing, âI was in Silicon Valley recently, for about a week, to
discuss vulnerabilities and opportunities in cyber with industry
leaders â¦ They agreed â we all agreed on the need to share threat
information at network speed.â
Google co-founder Sergey Brin attended previous meetings of the ESF
group but because of a scheduling conflict, according to Alexanderâs
email, he also could not attend the Aug. 8 briefing in San Jose, and
itâs unknown if someone else from Google was sent.
A few months earlier, Alexander had emailed Brin to thank him for
Googleâs participation in the ESF.
âI see ESFâs work as critical to the nationâs progress against the
threat in cyberspace and really appreciate Vint Cerf [Googleâs vice
president and chief Internet evangelist], Eric Grosse [vice president
of security engineering] and Adrian Ludwigâs [lead engineer for
Android security] contributions to these efforts during the past
year,â Alexander wrote in a Jan. 13, 2012, email.
âYou recently received an invitation to the ESF Executive Steering
Group meeting, which will be held on January 19, 2012. The meeting is
an opportunity to recognize our 2012 accomplishments and set direction
for the year to come. We will be discussing ESFâs goals and specific
targets for 2012. We will also discuss some of the threats we see and
what we are doing to mitigate those threats â¦ Your insights, as a key
member of the Defense Industrial Base, are valuable to ensure ESFâs
efforts have measurable impact.â
A Google representative declined to answer specific questions about
Brinâs and Schmidtâs relationship with Alexander or about Googleâs
work with the government.
âWe work really hard to protect our users from cyberattacks, and we
always talk to experts â including in the U.S. government â so we stay
ahead of the game,â the representative said in a statement to Al
Jazeera. âItâs why Sergey attended this NSA conference.â
Brin responded to Alexander the following day even though the head of
the NSA didnât use the appropriate email address when contacting the
âHi Keith, looking forward to seeing you next week. FYI, my best email
address to use is [redacted],â Brin wrote. âThe one your email went to
â sergey.brin â I donât really check.â

we're almost family Pete, no need to introduce yourself!
  ... was starting to wonder how you've been...
   you never call, you rarely write,
regarding your piece published at:
 this reply is a little long, as i took the time to respond in depth to
each of the issues i observed in your piece; i hope you view this as
the best of intentions and sincere desire for thoroughness it is.  any
criticism is entirely constructive.  if you feel despondent or
hopeless about the future where you have been so wrong and so ill
equipped to secure digital systems, see the end of this thread for
crisis hotline resources in your area.
you might be interested in the other thread on treating addiction.  my
own empirical study linking INFOSEC/COMSEC responsibilities with
ethanol abuse, clandestine chemical poisonings, and a rapidly
escalating habit for high fiber lifestyle is progressing nicely, but
not yet ready for publication. (DWDM not ingested fiber)
agreed!  i find it very helpful to find vulns first, use them for
early signalling of adversary capabilities and interest, weaponize
them for great justice, and distribute them in limited fashion toward
end of life cycle to friends and peers, where again they serve as
useful feedback on third party OPSEC and integrity.
unfortunately in previous private vulnerability assessments all social
media platforms failed to survive our common criteria for credible
computing contract services.  at least you're not paying for them? ...
i will however provide my feedback via this medium:
0. "how to make it hurt less"
first off, you may be interested in my research on the best synth
routes for clandestine medicating and near term memory cleansing with
common chemicals or seedy suppliers.  this information was cultivated
during my research into INFOSEC/COMSEC professional who are clearly
exceptionally capable in this domain.
1. "You canât manage vulnerabilities in closed software any more than
you can manage tunnel construction in an ant nest."
this is not true.  by actively managing the execution of all processes
on all your systems and the communication they make between each other
and remote (networked or bus connected services) peers.
blocking and altering shared library methods, system calls, and
network communication is effective against open source, closed source,
promiscuous source, and other development practices.
2. "Managing vulnerabilities will not get you security. Especially
since patched vulnerabilities is a subset of found vulnerabilities
which is assumed (for far too many) to be a subset of having
this is why it is critical to find as many vulnerabilities as possible
in the systems you use before others do.  use the vulnerabilities you
find as a model of class of weakness upon which to defend in depth.
more to do after this, but for another discussion... ;)
3. "But if you wanted to have all the domesticated animals on your new
arc you canât do it by only looking house pets as that would exclude
goats, cows, horses, yetis, and many animals maybe you donât know or
didnât consider. So when scanning for vulnerabilities you can only, at
best, find the vulnerabilities the scanner knows about."
i for one wish they omitted the goats.  they make great work on the
blackberry bushes, but the pasture fences are challenge and escalating
war of attrition they so far show no difficulty defeating with clever
goat skillz.
more to the point above, this is why it is critical to employ not just
all existing scanners, fuzzers, frameworks, and toolsets but also to
improve them internally while also developing your own infrastructure
for vulnerability discovery, defense, and weaponization. (this is
called "big vuln" or "big vuln dev" by our team for lack of a better
4. "It Can Feel a Lot Like Doing Dishes. Vulnerability management is
an endless race that canât be won."
so true! however, this is why complete and continuous automation is
mandatory at the moment of analyst discovery or developer prototype.
thus the repetitiveness is delegated to the machines who do our
bidding without tire or negligence.
5. "when you manage operational controls as part of vulnerability
management you can actually take yourself out of the rat race of patch
vs. exploit. Thatâs huge!"
patch vs. exploit is a false dichotomy.  if you're not solving for
both concurrently you're doing it wrong.
(don't feel bad, this is a common failure.)
6. "Filling a Hole Has Never Been So Dirty ... We think vulnerability
management is straight-forward: thereâs a hole and you fill it and the
hole is gone."
who are these "we" you speak of?  the last time i saw that mindset in
play was a sales associate for a security consulting firm hawking some
weird devops / continuous integration like thing i don't remember too
anyone who thinks vulnerability management is easy is unaware of their
ignorance, risk, and update latencies in their organization.
7. "In the end, playing dirty is the only way most vulnerability
managers can keep their heads above water. But letâs just call that a
risk decision."
what you call "playing dirty" is just decision making in the midst of
a series of one crises after another in an endless procession.  crisis
mitigation and resolution should not be cast in a negative air of
"playing dirty".  rather, take this as opportunity to find the
exceptionally rare operations crew who runs a ship so tight there are
no crises, only prioritized opportunities for even further
8. "closely followed by NATO, NIST, FBI, NASA, NSA, all branches of
armed forces, and the White House."
this is just awefull! i suffered through a number of years with a
stalker intent on making me into a skin cover for a realdoll in some
psychotic delusion he was compelled by.  i know the unease and fear
and stress that a malicious stalker can have on the psyche.  i presume
you've looked into local resources to prosecute or order to be

i am taking this moment to segue into one last observation in your
piece, but it deals with adult subject matter that may not be
appropriate for all audiences.  if you are not mature enough for the
discussion below, please don't read it!
 - this break intentionally inserted for decency -
Z. "... the adult film star process which pretty much gets you from
film star to adult film star by doing just one thing on film."
i don't often discuss my personal past in these lists or online in general.
for a while i had a career in INFOSEC but came to a realization that
there must other line of work supporting a upper middle class salary
which were not so terribly detrimental to my mental and physical
health.  i transitioned into gonzo group gay porn which met the cost
of living requirements but still had above average physical demands
even if a great improvement over the dark INFOSEC years. after five
years building a library of over 1,782 different scenes stretching to
12 days of continuous copulation my career in porn was ended in a
crippling accident while testing a prototype manbian machine fucking
investment that was my doom rather than return on investment.  don't
write me, the rights have already been sold for a moving drama with A
list cast.
my point is that i published a greatest "best-of coderass at 1.75 FPS,
abridged" anthology as career end salute on a 180 minute collector
s edition BluRay paid for by the sale of creative rights mentioned
above.  this video release rocketed to the top of all the best seller
lists and made me a household name and continues to feed me a torrent
of franchise fees, recurring profit share, and ongoing royalties which
can only be described as obscene and ridiculous.  for some reason
every other effort was just not enough to bump me up above obscure D
list status...  it's a funny world.
TL;DR: my adult film star process required 1,782 scenes, 45,000
minutes of film, and spanned 73%* of known sex acts possible to act
out between two or more humans but less than twenty humans at once.
this is as far removed from "doing just one thing" as i can imagine,
and frankly it disrespects the strenuous effort and creative acting
myself and other sex workers practice in mostly thankless service to
others. you should be ashamed!
 [* automatic identification and categorization of sex acts is
surprisingly complicated! the corresponding language theoretic effort
to map 1 to 20 human bodies in movement for 15 minutes or less into a
formal language to exhaustively delineate all the possible perversions
possible to commit under the sun was gargantuan in terms of earth
human hours and the resulting corpus. we are close to proving that not
everything which can be done has been. if you would be interested in
performing a provably unique sex act for a large sum of money and only
modest surgical modification, please get in touch]
P.P.S. some people ask me what i do now for a living since confined to
robotic wheelchair and bed rest. the truth is, i could never turn my
back entirely on the INFOSEC community in which i started my first
career and sojourn into the great world alone.
so now i am busking at conferences doing INFOSEC comedy routines,
selling nerdcore rap put to chiptunes on independent labels, and
manning the crisis hotlines for substance abuse and domestic violence
victims, who strangely enough overlap to a non trivial degree with the
set of self confessed INFOSEC professionals.
my time spent replying to INFOSEC threads on mailing lists is gratis,
as no one pays me for it, and no one like what i say enough to tip me.

poor pooh bear, what a confusing world to live in...
NO SPOILERS!
my take on the interesting bits:
regarding the phones in the fridge, this was done to muffle sound, not
provide EMSEC protection. a fridge is not a faraday cage! (there has
been some speculation, now definitively squashed.)
regarding the scope of surveillance and exploitation, it is
interesting to see how far Alexander really pushed things beyond
normative for the agency.  i knew he was a "spy cowboy", yet this book
presents a clearer picture of how significant Alexander escalated
Hayden's already aggressive agenda.
regarding the intimidation and maligning of leak reporters, it was
interesting to see how egregious some of the efforts to thwart and
discredit reporting on this story were.

1% making the cut is a far too generous estimate, perhaps 1% of 1%. as
for the cost issue, which must be paid somewhere,
you make two assumptions:
first, assuming the externalities of insecure systems are simply
non-exist-ant.  the costs of our pervasive vulnerability are
gargantuan, yet the complexity and cost of robust alternatives
instills paralysis. (this lack of significant progress in development
of secure systems feeds your defeatist observations; it's ok ;)
second, that the schedules and styles of development as we currently
practice it will always be.  if you solved a core (commodity) infosec

would only need to implement it once! (then spending five years and

Stingrays can track cell phones whenever the phones are turned on, not
just when they are making or receiving calls.
Stingrays force cell phones in range to transmit information back âat
full signal, consuming battery faster.â Is your phone losing battery
power particularly quickly today? Maybe the cops are using a stingray
When in use, stingrays are âevaluating all the [cell phone] handsets
in the areaâ in order to search for the suspectâs phone. That means
that large numbers of innocent bystandersâ location and phone
information is captured.
In this case, police used two versions of the stingray â one mounted
on a police vehicle, and the other carried by hand. Police drove
through the area using the vehicle-based device until they found the
apartment complex in which the target phone was located, and then they
walked around with the handheld device and stood âat every door and
every window in that complexâ until they figured out which apartment
the phone was located in. In other words, police were lurking outside
peopleâs windows and sending powerful electronic signals into their
private homes in order to collect information from within.
The Tallahassee detective testifying in the hearing estimated that,
between spring of 2007 and August of 2010, the Tallahassee Police had
used stingrays approximately â200 or more times.â
it gets worse from here...  ;)

not only are the Stingray/IMSI catcher devices not properly

arguments that don't hold water.
- The Known Tools Hint at Deeper Invasive Techniques, Also Lacking Oversight
not only is location / metadata (penregister) information obtained,
but similar programs with private industry selling advanced tools to
law enforcement will uncover even more egregious violations of law
extending to full content (wiretap) collection without sufficient
authority or oversight.
- The Lawless Intercepts and Unlawful Invasions Of Privacy Shielded by
Prosecutors and Judiciary using Reverse Forensics
 the synergy of "parallel construction meets illegal intercepts" will
uncover the ways in which initial aggressive legal interpretations are
further distorted, and secrecy further applied paramount, to serve the
interests of prosecutor careers and public face over actual justice
and respect for law.
- Truly In-discriminant and Whole-sale Invasions of Constitutionally
Protected Communications Are Routine Fed Behaviors
and not just routine but the expected side effects of military
blunt-force intelligence gathering systems aimed at domestic targets
illegally. these military systems covertly re-purposed for domestic

U.S. Marshals Seize Local Copsâ Cell Phone Tracking Files in
Extraordinary Attempt to Keep Information From Public
Government Secrecy
By Nathan Freed Wessler, Staff Attorney, ACLU Speech, Privacy &
Technology Project at 12:13pm
A run-of-the-mill public records request about cell phone surveillance
submitted to a local police department in Florida has unearthed
blatant violations of open government laws, including an incredible
seizure of state records by the U.S. Marshals Service, which is part
of the Justice Department. Today the ACLU and the ACLU of Florida
filed an emergency motion in state court to preserve the publicâs
right of access to government records.
Over the past several months, the ACLU has filed dozens of public
records requests with Florida law enforcement agencies seeking
information about their use of controversial cell phone tracking
devices known as âstingrays.â (The devices are also known as âcell
site simulatorsâ or âIMSI catchers.â) Stingrays track phones by
mimicking service providersâ cell towers and sending out powerful
signals that trick nearby phones â including phones of countless
bystanders â into sending their locations and identifying information.
The Florida agenciesâ responses to our requests have varied widely,
with some stonewalling and others releasing records. The most recent
request went to the Sarasota Police Department, and the fallout from
that request has raised red flag after red flag.
RED FLAG  The Sarasota Police initially told us that they had
responsive records, including applications filed by and orders issued
to a local detective under the state âtrap and traceâ statute that he
had relied on for authorization to conduct stingray surveillance. That
raised the first red flag, since trap and trace orders are typically
used to gather limited information about the phone numbers of incoming
calls, not to track cell phones inside private spaces or conduct
dragnet surveillance. And, such orders require a very low legal
standard. As one federal magistrate judge has held, police should be
permitted to use stingrays only after obtaining a probable cause
warrant, if at all.
RED FLAG  The Sarasota Police set up an appointment for us to
inspect the applications and orders, as required by Florida law. But a
few hours before that appointment, an assistant city attorney sent an
email cancelling the meeting on the basis that the U.S. Marshals
Service was claiming the records as their own and instructing the
local cops not to release them. Their explanation: the Marshals
Service had deputized the local officer, and therefore the records
were actually the property of the federal government.
We emphatically disagree, since the Sarasota detective created the
applications, brought them to court, and retained the applications and
orders in his files. Merely giving him a second title (âSpecial Deputy
U.S. Marshalâ) does not change these facts. But regardless, once the
Sarasota Police Department received our records request, state law
required them to hold onto the records for at least 30 days, to give
us an opportunity to go to court and seek an order for release of the
Instead of complying with that clear legal obligation, the local
police allowed the records to disappear by letting the U.S. Marshals
drive down from their office in Tampa, seize the physical files, and
move them to an unknown location. Weâve seen our fair share of federal
government attempts to keep records about stingrays secret, but weâve
never seen an actual physical raid on state records in order to
conceal them from public view.
RED FLAG  Realizing we werenât going to get hold of the Sarasota
Police Departmentâs copies of the applications and orders anytime
soon, we asked the county court if we could obtain copies from its
files. Incredibly, the court said it had no copies. The court doesnât
even have docket entries indicating that applications were filed or
orders issued. Apparently, the local detective came to court with a
single paper copy of the application and proposed order, and then
walked out with the same papers once signed by a judge.
Court rules â and the First Amendment â require judges to retain
copies of judicial records and to make them available to the public,
but the court (and the detective) completely flouted those
requirements here.
The ACLUâs emergency motion seeks a temporary injunction preventing
the Sarasota Police Department from transferring any more files to the
U.S. Marshals, as well as a determination that the police violated
state law by sending the stingray applications and orders to the
Marshals Service in the first place and an order requiring the police
to produce the records.
When the government obtains court authorization to use invasive
surveillance equipment, the public should not be kept in the dark. We
have open records laws for a reason, but they mean nothing if the
government can violate their clear commands at its whim.

Right now, we're gearing for MuckRock's biggest investigative project
yet, and we need your help. First, a little context.
Local police departments across America are increasingly tapping into
information from your cell phone: Your location, who you're with, who
you are calling. Using fake cell phone towers, often called Stingrays,
they generally don't even need a warrant, and have relatively few
restrictions on who, when, and what they collect. Or how they use it.
Since these programs are often funded by federal grants,  very few
people outside of law enforcement know how, or even if, they're being
used, with almost non-existent debate about if this information should
be collected, and what limits should be set for for how it's used or
how long it's kept.
This is where you come in. We're launching this project on Beacon
Reader, where a donation of just $5, about what it costs for us to
successfully file a request, can make a big difference. Just like with
the Drone Census, often times MuckRock is the *only* group asking for
this information, which otherwise would never be made public.
You can support the project at this link, and, again, even just $5 can
make a huge difference:
If you're not in a position to help financially, we would still really
appreciate your help â share what we're up to with your friends,
sending in news articles you see or tips regarding cell phone
tracking, and, in a few days, sending in information regarding which
departments you'd like us to file with through a special page on
Thanks for all your support in the past, and we're looking forward to
working with you to shine a light on this under-reported area.

strength. (i don't consider passive surveillance an attack - more like

flashing their own goods at shop assistants. It turns out this was actually
an entry for a contest to become Pornhubâs creative director, and Titcoin

"Identity Intelligence and Special Operations"
 - Posted on Jul.30, 2014  by Steven Aftergood
"Identity intelligenceâ is a relatively new intelligence construct
that refers to the analysis and use of personal information, including
biometric and forensic data among others, to identify intelligence
targets of interest and to deny them anonymity.
The term began to appear a few years ago and was included, for
example, in a 2012 Defense Intelligence Agencybriefing package. Since
then it has quickly propagated throughout U.S. military and
intelligence operations.
The new DoD doctrine on Special Operations â Joint Publication 3-05,
dated 16 July 2014 â includes further discussion of identity
intelligence (I2) in the special operations context:
âI2 is the collection, analysis, exploitation, and management of
identity attributes and associated technologies and processes. The
identification process utilizes biometrics-enabled intelligence (BEI),
forensics-enabled intelligence (FEI), information obtained through
document and media exploitation (DOMEX), and combat information and
intelligence to identify a person or members of a group.â
âI2 fuses identity attributes (biological, biographical, behavioral,
and reputational information related to individuals) and other
information and intelligence associated with those attributes
collected across all intelligence disciplinesâ¦.â
âUSSOCOM [US Special Operations Command] exploits biometric, forensic,
document and media data collections and integrates the data with
all-source intelligence to locate and track unattributed identities
across multiple or disparate instances. Intelligence collections are
processed through the appropriate DOD and interagency databases,
exploited to produce intelligence, and then disseminated to deployed
SOF and throughout the interagency. I2 products enable real-time
decisions in special operations worldwide.â
âSpecial operations require unique modes of employment, tactics,
techniques, procedures, and equipment. They are often conducted in
hostile, denied, or politically and/or diplomatically sensitive
environments, and are characterized by one or more of the following:
time-sensitivity, clandestine or covert nature, low visibility, work
with or through indigenous forces, greater requirements for regional
orientation and cultural expertise, and a higher degree of risk,â JP
3-05 says.

the same thing themselves, I just read through the entire history of
issues in pycryptopp and classified whether they were runtime errors
(and therefore potential security bugs) or build-time errors
(therefore probably not), and whether they would have been avoided if
we had been disabling assembly optimizations all along. Here are the
results. They clearly show that we should disable the optimized
assembly! About half of all the security-threatening bugs we've had
would never have been an issue if we'd avoided assembly from the
By the way, in my opinion the author of Crypto++, Wei Dai, is an
*exceptionally* skilled, careful, and experienced coder, and I would
assume that if Crypto++ has had this many security-threatening bugs in
its optimized assembly code, then other crypto libraries that also use
optimized assembly code also have at least as many.
Here's the ticket to track this issue:
bugs that cause run-time failures

in the non-ASM version!)

latest update, details of note:

@_subject: minimum viable toolset for low level malware forensics [was: BadBIOS forensics] 
for those technical, the minimum viable toolset for identifying low
level subversive programming is:
- a solid base (clean hw, clean installs, clean environment) in a
separate location with RF shielding. (a closed metal barn out in the
country, for example. if you're a geek you love the thought of a
faraday closet ;)
- instrumented runtime (e.g. volatility memory forensics, system
performance profiling, all to append only storage) on any systems you
are using as suspect to attack.
- obstructed runtime (see thread on "how to hack your systems before
someone else") - this is optional; a modified system that appears to
be vulnerable / stock condition will exhibit undefined behavior under
attempted enabling, sometimes. otherwise it may be difficult to
identify a successful infection.
- direct flash memory pinout rig (specs for all chips including flash
memory associated with BIOS, integrated management controllers,
network devices, I/O ports, keyboard, trac pad or mouse, HD/DVD/CD
drives, graphics memory, wifi, 4g, and bluetooth wireless adapters
will be needed  you're programming an FPGA to perform reads directly
from the flash chips. converting flash memory into high level block
storage the next black art upward.
- wide band high performance software defined radio. you will be
building custom GNU radio blocks and running many from third party
repositories or research projects. you are using a two stage process,
where wide sweeps and auto ranging are applied to sample swaths of
signal of interest to storage. then parallel processing on other
hardware or later time (off-use-hours) extracting known / useful data
and anomalies for further analysis.
- in-line network archival, shaping, and cut-out for link to internet
ethernet bridge with ARP spoofing and ether mangling at each end. that
does not speak IP at all. the shaping is used to squelch suspect or
unexpected peak traffic (both a signalling system for malicious
activity and a means to constrain the reach once compromised)
as per the kit above,
you are instrumenting a system to observe its runtime behavior on an
external audit system. this is because the advanced attacks inject
into processes and ring0, persisting only what is needed / chosen
(enabling hooks). you need to capture the active payloads that are
delivered on-demand in host memory space.
you are observing the network and RF space for anomalies and
discrepancies. for example, a wifi radio disabled yet still emitting
into 2.4Ghz/5.xGhz spectrum.  network captures also provide evidence
to correlate with malicious memory, for example identifying a payload
delivered over the network, with keys from volatility used to decrypt
the encrypted communications containing the payload identified in
you are (sometimes destructively) sampling all flash memory as parts
of advanced payloads persist outside of the OS and storage level
interface visibility. (stealth at bus/bios level). discrepancies in
blocks that should not have changed, executable code segments where
not expected, strange carvings of wear leveling around "protected"
offsets. all of these are indicators for further scrutiny and
instruction level reversing (if corresponding to microcontroller
programming instructions for manipulating streams read or written to
and from device, for example :)
last but not least, you are not getting attached to any hardware,
because at any moment you may find it all suspect and have to replace
all laptops, desktops, routers, printers, mobile devices, storage
media, media servers, smart televisions, and god forbid you installed
one of those intelligent thermostats. [ laugh for sanity, then go back
and read the list, and then understand that the far end of the nation
state malware asymptote is full of freaky exotics. i also hope you
never hit that level of "all systems go" *grin* ]

@_subject: Meet the Muslim-American Leaders the FBI and NSA Have Been Spying On 
latest from The Intercept:
 a choice excerpt:
The FBIâwhich is listed as the âresponsible agencyâ for surveillance
on the five menâhas a controversial record when it comes to the ethnic
profiling of Muslim-Americans. According to FBI training materials
uncovered by Wired in 2011, the bureau taught agents to treat
âmainstreamâ Muslims as supporters of terrorism, to view charitable
donations by Muslims as âa funding mechanism for combat,â and to view
Islam itself as a âDeath Starâ that must be destroyed if terrorism is
to be contained.
John Guandolo, a former FBI counterterrorism official who takes credit
for developing a training program for agents on the âMuslim
Brotherhood and their subversive movement in the United States,â told
The Intercept that he participated in investigations of some of the
individuals whose email accounts were monitored. Echoing the âred
under every bedâ hysteria of the McCarthy era, Guandolo believes that
âhundredsâ of covert members of the Muslim Brotherhood are active in
the United States, that some of them have succeeded in infiltrating
the Pentagon, and that CIA director John Brennan is a secret Muslim.
Other former and current federal officials say such beliefs are not
representative of the FBI or Justice Department. But blatant prejudice
against Muslim-Americans is also documented in the Snowden archive.
In one 2005 document, intelligence community personnel are instructed
how to properly format internal memos to justify FISA surveillance. In
the place where the targetâs real name would go, the memo offers a
fake name as a placeholder: âMohammed Raghead.â

@_subject: XKeyScore code authenticity - genuine [was: messing with XKeyScore] 
the theme of messing with XKeyScore is amusing[0], but more to the
point i was asked to respond to some concerns of authenticity made in
a different post:
"Validating XKeyScore code"
i'm trying to keep this feedback technical, as i don't like much of
Graham's reasoning. (i do however approve of his use of "Great Man" in
the Voldemort sense, in reference to Cowboy Alexander[1])
his claim that "we believe the code partly fake and that it came from
the Snowden treasure trove." should be ammended:
"we believe the code deprecated, and that it came from the Snowden archives"
first segment of summary, by point:
# Point 1)
"The signatures are old (2011 to 2012), so it fits within the Snowden
timeframe, and is unlikely to be a recent leak."
 - agreed.
# Point 2)
"The code is weird, as if they are snippets combined from training
manuals rather than operational code. That would mean it is âfakeâ."
 - false; the code is valid and deprecated (can be used as example)
rather than false. the technical detail. as a programmer, i know that
a regexp rule like:
extractors: {{
    bridges[] =
  }}
is both written by a novice regexp'er, and also took them a bit of
time. more than they'd spend on an example.
for another example,
for (size_t i=0; i < bridges.size(); ++i) {
        std::string address = bridges[i][0] + ":" + bridges[i][1];
        DB[SCHEMA_OLD]["tor_bridge"] = address;
        DB.apply();
        DB[SCHEMA_NEW]["tor_ip"] = bridges[i][0];
        DB[SCHEMA_NEW]["tor_port_or"] = bridges[i][1];
        DB[SCHEMA_NEW]["tor_flags"] = FLAGS;
        DB.apply();
      }
why two commits here to backend changes? as a programmer i understand
why this is done, but as a purely fictitious example the double commit
is pointless noise.
# Point 3)
"The story makes claims about the source that are verifiably false,
leading us to believe that they may have falsified the origin of this
source code."
 - false
how does limited misunderstanding arcane technicalities invalidate the entirety?
 if this were true, Robert Graham would be a complete imbecile, rather
than  technically competent and occasionally wrong.
# Point 4)
"The code is so domain specific that it probably is, in some fashion,
related to real XKeyScore code â if fake, it's not completely so."
 - false. as stated above, these rules are deprecated rather than
fictitiously constructed. (and perhaps referenced in training
materials for utilizing the particular language engines demonstrated)
as explained above, and i will go into more detail later (i wager i
have more big data experience and DPI experience than Mr. Graham the
DPI expert does in this domain alone[2] ;)
last but not least, this speaks to the need for greater technical
expertise to be applied to the leaked archives.  if anything, the
nature of domain specific details discussed here show that not just
generalists, but an army of specialists, will ultimately be needed to
properly parse and protect based upon the archives as yet revealed.

an impasse of extremes, a full or limited dump off the table.
let's find a middle ground. how best to proceed?
very great indeed.  what kind of tools would make the journalists
involved more effective and productive?
1. using the leaks currently published, devise a framework for "data
mining" the leak documents, aka, generating metadata from the data and
operating various matches and relevance across the metadata to narrow
the search and aggregate related efforts or technologies across their
compartmentalized worlds.
2.  requires that there is an index of special terms, techniques,
suppliers, code names, algorithms, etc. that used to generate the
metadata for deeper search and tie to general themes of surveillance.
3. extrapolating from current leaks, also look toward recent
advancements and specific technical tell tales of interest.  doping
silicon as tailored access technique? this could refer to compromised
runs of security processors for desired targets. etc.
4. justifying technical detail specifically.  we have seen so little
technical detail of the source code / hardware design level.  how best
to justify source code - explaining that the language choice, the
nature of the algorithms, the structure of the distributed computing
upon which it runs all conveys critical technical details important to
understand what part of our technologies are compromised, and guiding
the fixes required to protect against such compromises?
in short, it would behoove us to build tools to make the journalists
more effective, rather than bitch about not being included in the
inner circle.  (sadly, many good knowledge discovery tools are
proprietary and applied to open source intelligence)
what types of features would you want such a leak-assistant software
to have?  what types of existing tools, if any, would provide these

@_subject: [oss-security] Strong Security Processes Require Strong Privacy Protections 
"Strong Security Processes Require Strong Privacy Protections"
A request for all security conscious organizations handling
vulnerability reports to deploy privacy enhancing technologies.
With the Snowden disclosures and Google's Project Zero on the minds of
security professionals everywhere, it is time to evaluate one more
aspect of this renewed focus on 0day and targeted attacks:
vulnerability submission to vendors. [0][1]
Software vulnerabilities of use to nation states and espionage
organizations are recognized as a threat to privacy and basic human
rights. Their impact no longer dismissable or discounted given
evidence of misuse. I will not discuss hardware vulnerabilities in
this treatment as they entail different considerations and
constraints. [2]
Reporting vulnerabilities of this nature in turn requires strong
privacy protections commensurate with the five and six digit monetary
values they command, and the adversaries intent on discouraging their
discovery or mitigation. [3][4]
Therefore, any organization handling vulnerability reports must
support strong privacy for vulnerability submission. This is mandatory
even if most or all issues received via this channel are not 0day, not
high value, and entail very little risk to users.
The characteristics of a strong private reporting method are:
- Email must not be used. In the best circumstances email leaks too
much information. In common situations it is passed around clear text,
trivially interfered with, and winds through software with huge
usability and vulnerability problems. Email for initial security
vulnerability reporting must cease immediately. [5][6]
- Public web systems for vulnerability reporting must not be used.
Like email, this leaks too much information and is vulnerable to a
wide array of attacks destroying any privacy intended. [7][8]
- Submission of reports via hidden site required. This has become
fashionable in media organizations as the "secure drop" for
whistleblowers, and it is equally apropriate for vulnerability
reporting. This significantly raises the cost of surveilling a
vulnerability reporting service, and ensures that passive interception
of reported vulnerabilities is impossible. [9]
- Encryption of submitted reports required. PGP and GPG are wonderful
tools, despite encrypted email being a dismal failure. While the
hidden drop may protect the privacy of the reporter, encryption of the
report content to specific vulnerability researchers' keys ensures
privacy to the receiver. A compromise of the hidden site must not lead
to access of reported vulnerabilities. [10]
- Submitter anonymity the default. Submissions and communication must
accomodate an anonymous identity. If a researcher wishes to claim
credit they must opt-in and provide additional information. No
psuedonymous account requirements, no key linking across submissions.
- Obfuscated disclosure should be available if desired. Capturing 0day
in the wild used for espionage or cyber effects is a rare event.
Publicly disclosing when, where, and how you obtained such captures
ensures you're likely never to see any others. Researchers in position
to observe and inspect such events should be able to report the
vulnerabilities without credit and without indicating the origin. A
vendor could provide a "cover story" for how the vulnerability was
discovered internally, to best protect sources' ability to continue to
discover these types of weaponized exploits in the wild.
Finally, it goes without saying that this privacy applies during
reporting and mitigation phases of defect resolution. Once a patch is
prepared and public the details of the vulnerability should be public
as well, via email list, public blog, or any other useful medium.
As participants in the security industry it behooves us all to set an
example for others and to demonstrate a committment to security and
privacy via action.
Security conscious organizations handling vulnerability reports can
support strong privacy and send a clear message deploying private
reporting methods described above.
Security researchers must demand strong privacy from organizations
they collaborate with, even in the most trivial or minor of
circumstances, so that infrequent severe vulnerabilities may also be
reported in confidence.
Privacy is a basic human right we must all support. Let's demonstrate
our support by using privacy enhancing technologies to resolve risks
to privacy!

evidence of misuse. I will not discuss hardware vulnerabilities in
this treatment as they entail different considerations and
constraints. [2]
Reporting vulnerabilities of this nature in turn requires strong
privacy protections commensurate with the five and six digit monetary
values they command, and the adversaries intent on discouraging their
discovery or mitigation. [3][4]
Therefore, any organization handling vulnerability reports must
support strong privacy for vulnerability submission. This is mandatory
even if most or all issues received via this channel are not 0day, not
high value, and entail very little risk to users.
The characteristics of a strong private reporting method are:
- Email must not be used. In the best circumstances email leaks too
much information. In common situations it is passed around clear text,
trivially interfered with, and winds through software with huge
usability and vulnerability problems. Email for initial security
vulnerability reporting must cease immediately. [5][6]
- Public web systems for vulnerability reporting must not be used.
Like email, this leaks too much information and is vulnerable to a
wide array of attacks destroying any privacy intended. [7][8]
- Submission of reports via hidden site required. This has become
fashionable in media organizations as the "secure drop" for
whistleblowers, and it is equally apropriate for vulnerability
reporting. This significantly raises the cost of surveilling a
vulnerability reporting service, and ensures that passive interception
of reported vulnerabilities is impossible. [9]
- Encryption of submitted reports required. PGP and GPG are wonderful
tools, despite encrypted email being a dismal failure. While the
hidden drop may protect the privacy of the reporter, encryption of the
report content to specific vulnerability researchers' keys ensures
privacy to the receiver. A compromise of the hidden site must not lead
to access of reported vulnerabilities. [10]
- Submitter anonymity the default. Submissions and communication must
accomodate an anonymous identity. If a researcher wishes to claim
credit they must opt-in and provide additional information. No
psuedonymous account requirements, no key linking across submissions.
- Obfuscated disclosure should be available if desired. Capturing 0day
in the wild used for espionage or cyber effects is a rare event.
Publicly disclosing when, where, and how you obtained such captures
ensures you're likely never to see any others. Researchers in position
to observe and inspect such events should be able to report the
vulnerabilities without credit and without indicating the origin. A
vendor could provide a "cover story" for how the vulnerability was
discovered internally, to best protect sources' ability to continue to
discover these types of weaponized exploits in the wild.
Finally, it goes without saying that this privacy applies during
reporting and mitigation phases of defect resolution. Once a patch is
prepared and public the details of the vulnerability should be public
as well, via email list, public blog, or any other useful medium.
As participants in the security industry it behooves us all to set an
example for others and to demonstrate a committment to security and
privacy via action.
Security conscious organizations handling vulnerability reports can
support strong privacy and send a clear message deploying private
reporting methods described above.
Security researchers must demand strong privacy from organizations
they collaborate with, even in the most trivial or minor of
circumstances, so that infrequent severe vulnerabilities may also be
reported in confidence.
Privacy is a basic human right we must all support. Let's demonstrate
our support by using privacy enhancing technologies to resolve risks
to privacy!

detailed technical info via J. Appelbaum, A. Gibson, J. Goetz, V.
Kabisch, L. Kampf, L. Ryge
The investigation discloses the following:
Two servers in Germany - in Berlin and Nuremberg - are under
surveillance by the NSA.
Merely searching the web for the privacy-enhancing software tools
outlined in the XKeyscore rules causes the NSA to mark and track the
IP address of the person doing the search. Not only are German privacy
software users tracked, but the source code shows that privacy
software users worldwide are tracked by the NSA.
Among the NSA's targets is the Tor network funded primarily by the US
government to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states.
 The XKeyscore rules reveal that the NSA tracks all connections to a
server that hosts part of an anonymous email service at the MIT
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. It also records details about visits to a
popular internet journal for Linux operating system users called "the
Linux Journal - the Original Magazine of the Linux Community", and
calls it an "extremist forum".
Three authors of this investigation have personal and professional
ties to the Tor Project, an American company mentioned within the
following investigation. Jacob Appelbaum is a paid employee of the Tor
Project, Aaron Gibson is a paid contractor for the Tor Project, and
Leif Ryge is a volunteer contributor to various Tor-related software
projects. Their research in this story is wholly independent from the
Tor Project and does not reflect the views of the Tor Project in any
way. During the course of the investigation, it was further discovered
that an additional computer system run by Jacob Appelbaum for his
volunteer work with helping to run part of the Tor network was
targeted by the NSA. Moreover, all members of this team are Tor users
and appear to be have been targets of the mass surveillance described
in the investigation.
It is a small server that looks like any of the other dozens in the
same row. It is in a large room devoted to computers and computer
storage, just like every other room in this industrial park building
on Am Tower Street just outside the city of Nuremberg. That the grey
building is surrounded by barbed wire seems to indicate that the
servers' provider is working hard to secure their customers' data.
Yet despite these efforts, one of the servers is targeted by the NSA.
The IP address 212.212.245.170 is explicitly specified in the rules of
the powerful and invasive spy software program XKeyscore. The code is
published here exclusively for the first time.
After a year of NSA revelations based on documents that focus on
program names and high-level Powerpoint presentations, NDR and WDR are
revealing NSA source code that shows how these programs function and
how they are implemented in Germany and around the world.
Months of investigation by the German public television broadcasters
NDR and WDR, drawing on exclusive access to top secret NSA source
code, interviews with former NSA employees, and the review of secret
documents of the German government reveal that not only is the server
in Nuremberg under observation by the NSA, but so is virtually anyone
who has taken an interest in several well-known privacy software
The NSA program XKeyscore is a collection and analysis tool and "a
computer network exploitation system", as described in an NSA
presentation. It is one of the agencyâs most ambitious programs
devoted to gathering "nearly everything a user does on the internet."
The source code contains several rules that enable agents using
XKeyscore to surveil privacy-conscious internet users around the
world. The rules published here are specifically directed at the
infrastructure and the users of the Tor Network, the Tails operating
system, and other privacy-related software.
Tor, also known as The Onion Router, is a network of several thousand
volunteer-operated servers, or nodes, that work in concert to conceal
Tor users' IP addresses and thus keep them anonymous while online.
Tails is a privacy-focused GNU/Linux-based operating system that runs
entirely from an external storage device such as a USB stick or CD. It
comes with Tor and other privacy tools pre-installed and configured,
and each time it reboots it automatically wipes everything that is not
saved on an encrypted persistent storage medium.
Normally a user's online traffic - such as emails, instant messages,
searches, or visits to websites - can be attributed to the IP address
assigned to them by their internet service provider. When a user goes
online over the Tor Network, their connections are relayed through a
number of Tor nodes using another layer of encryption between each
server such that the first server cannot see where the last server is
located and vice-versa.
Tor is used by private individuals who want to conceal their online
activity, human rights activists in oppressive regimes such as China
and Iran, journalists who want to protect their sources, and even by
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in their efforts to infiltrate
criminal groups without revealing their identity. The Tor Project is a
non-profit charity based in Massachusetts and is primarily funded by
government agencies. Thus it is ironic that the Tor Network has become
such a high-priority target in the NSA's worldwide surveillance
As revealed by the British newspaper The Guardian, there have been
repeated efforts to crack the Tor Network and de-anonymize its users.
The top secret presentations published in October last year show that
Tor is anathema to the NSA. In one presentation, agents refer to the
network as "the king of high-secure, low-latency internet anonymity".
Another is titled "Tor Stinks". Despite the snide remarks, the agents
admit, "We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the
The former NSA director General Keith Alexander stated that all those
communicating with encryption will be regarded as terror suspects and
will be monitored and stored as a method of prevention, as quoted by
the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in August last year. The top secret
source code published here indicates that the NSA is making a
concerted effort to combat any and all anonymous spaces that remain on
the internet. Merely visiting privacy-related websites is enough for a
user's IP address to be logged into an NSA database.
An examination of the XKeyscore rules published here goes beyond the
slide presentation and provides a window into the actual instructions
given to NSA computers. The code was deployed recently and former NSA
employees and experts are convinced that the same code or similar code
is still in use today. The XKeyscore rules include elements known as
"appids", "fingerprints", and "microplugins".  Each connection a user
makes online - to a search engine, for example - can be assigned a
single appid and any number of fingerprints.
Appids are unique identifiers for a connection in XKeyscore. Appid
rules have weights assigned to them.  When multiple appids match a
given connection, the one with the highest weight is chosen.
Microplugins may contain software written in general-purpose
programming languages, such as C++, which can extract and store
specific types of data. The rules specifically target the Tor
Project's email and web infrastructure, as well as servers operated by
key volunteers in Germany, the United States, Sweden, Austria, and the
Netherlands. Beyond being ethically questionable, the attacks on Tor
also raise legal concerns.  The IP addresses of Tor servers in the
United States are amongst the targets, which could violate the fourth
amendment of the US constitution.
The German attorney Thomas Stadler, who specializes in IT law,
commented: "The fact that a German citizen is specifically traced by
the NSA, in my opinion, justifies the reasonable suspicion of the NSA
carrying out secret service activities in Germany. For this reason,
the German Federal Public Prosecutor should look into this matter and
initiate preliminary proceedings."
One of NSA's German targets is 212.212.245.170.  The string of numbers
is an IP address assigned to Sebastian Hahn, a computer science
student at the University of Erlangen. Hahn operates the server out of
a grey high-security building a few kilometers from where he lives.
Hahn, 28 years old and sporting a red beard, volunteers for the Tor
Project in his free time. He is especially trusted by the Tor
community, as his server is not just a node, it is a so-called
Directory Authority. There are nine of these worldwide, and they are
central to the Tor Network, as they contain an index of all Tor nodes.
A user's traffic is automatically directed to one of the directory
authorities to download the newest list of Tor relays generated each
Quellcode NSA  "anonymizer/tor/node/authority" fingerprint.
Hahn's predecessor named the server Gabelmoo, or Fork Man, the
nickname of a local statue of Poseidon. After a look at the NSA source
code, Hahn quickly found his server's name listed in the XKeyscore
rules. "Yes, I recognize the IP address of my Tor server called
'gabelmoo'." he said. "Millions of people use it to stay safe online,
and by watching the server and collecting metadata about its users,
those people are put at risk." The rule shown to Hahn, published
below, has a fingerprint called 'anonymizer/tor/node/authority'. The
fingerprint targets users who connect to Gabelmoo and other Tor
Directory Authority servers. In Germany, the Tor Directory Authorities
like Gabelmoo that are specifically targeted by XKeyscore rules are in
Berlin and Nuremberg. Additional targets are located in Austria,
Sweden, the United States, and the Netherlands.
Quellcode NSA  Fragments of XKeyscore rules targetting Tor directory
The expression below performs essentially the same function, but it
specifies the Tor directory authorities located in Five Eyes countries
(Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United
States) separately from those in other countries. As the comment
explains, the "goal is to find potential Tor clients connecting to the
Tor directory servers."
Another rule catalogs users connecting to known Tor relays. This is
not difficult, because the addresses of all normal Tor relays are
published by the directory authorities so that the Tor software on
users' computers can select its own path through the network. In
addition to the public relays, connections characterized as Tor based
on protocol identifiers are also cataloged.
Not only Metadata
Internet service providers in countries with strong censorship such as
China and Iran frequently block connections to known Tor relays. To
avoid this blocking, The Tor Project maintains a list of non-public
relays called "bridges" to allow users to avoid this type of blocking.
Bridges are run by volunteers and they share the details with the Tor
Project to help censored users reach the internet.
Quellcode NSA  Microplugin which extracts bridge addresses from the
full text of Tor Project emails.
Users can request a bridge address via email or on the web. The
following fingerprints show two ways that XKeyscore attempts to track
Tor bridge users. First, the fingerprint "anonymizer/tor/bridge/tls"
records connections to the bridges.torproject.org server. Second, in
order obtain the actual bridge addresses for the purpose of tracking
connections to them in the future, the "microplugin" fingerprint
called "anonymizer/tor/bridge/email" extracts data from the body of
the emails that the Tor Project sends to its users.
This code demonstrates the ease with which an XKeyscore rule can
analyze the full content of intercepted connections. The fingerprint
first checks every message using the "email_address" function to see
if the message is to or from "bridges Next, if the
address matched, it uses the "email_body" function to search the full
content of the email for a particular piece of text - in this case,
" If the "email_body" function finds
what it is looking for, it passes the full email text to a C++ program
which extracts the bridge addresses and stores them in a database.
Quellcode NSA  Fingerprint to identify visitors to the Tor Project website.
The full content of the email must already be intercepted before this
code can analyze it. XKeyscore also keeps track of people who are not
using Tor, but who are merely visiting The Tor Project's website
( as this rule demonstrates:
Quellcode NSA  Rules targeting people viewing the Tails or Linux
Journal websites, or performing Tails-related web searches.
It is interesting to note that this rule specifically avoids
fingerprinting users believed to be located in Five Eyes countries,
while other rules make no such distinction. For instance, the
following fingerprint targets users visiting the Tails and Linux
Journal websites, or performing certain web searches related to Tails,
and makes no distinction about the country of the user.
The comment in the  source code above describes Tails as "a comsec
mechanism advocated by extremists on extremist forums". In actuality,
the software is used by journalists, human rights activists, and
hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who merely wish to protect
their privacy.
The rules related to Tails clearly demonstrate how easily web searches
and website visits can be spied on by XKeyscore. On June 25, 2014, the
United States Supreme Court noted how sensitive this type of
information is in their Riley v. California decision against
warrantless searches of mobile phones: "An Internet search and
browsing history [...] could reveal an individualâs private interests
or concerns - perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease,
coupled with frequent visits to WebMD."
Quellcode NSA  C++ program which searches "raw traffic" for .onion addresses.
In addition to anonymous internet access, Tor also provides a
mechanism for hosting anonymous internet services called "Hidden
Services". These sites' URLs contain a domain name in the
pseudo-top-level-domain ".onion" which is only accessible using Tor.
The code shown below finds and catalogs URLs for these sites which
XKeyscore sees in "raw traffic", creating a unique fingerprint for
each onion address. Each .onion address found in raw traffic is
extracted and stored in an NSA database:
Quellcode NSA  "anonymizer/mailer/mixminion" appid matching all
connections to 128.31.0.34.
There are also rules that target users of numerous other
privacy-focused internet services, including HotSpotShield, FreeNet,
Centurian, FreeProxies.org, MegaProxy, privacy.li and an anonymous
email service called MixMinion as well as its predecessor MixMaster.
The appid rule for MixMinion is extremely broad as it matches all
traffic to or from the IP address 128.31.0.34, a server located on the
MIT campus.
That server is operated by the Tor Project's leader Roger Dingledine,
an MIT alumnus. The machine at this IP address provides many services
besides MixMinion, and it is also one of the above-mentioned Tor
directory authorities. Dingledine said "That computer hosts many
websites, ranging from open source gaming libraries to the Privacy
Enhancing Technologies Symposium website."
Sebastian Hahn, the Tor volunteer who runs Gabelmoo, was stunned to
learn that his hobby could interest the NSA: "This shows that Tor is
working well enough that Tor has become a target for the intelligence
services. For me this means that I will definitely go ahead with the
When asked for a reaction to the findings, the Tor Project's Roger
Dingledine stated the following: "We've been thinking of state
surveillance for years because of our work in places where journalists
are threatened. Tor's anonymity is based on distributed trust, so
observing traffic at one place in the Tor network, even a directory
authority, isn't enough to break it. Tor has gone mainstream in the
past few years, and its wide diversity of users - from civic-minded
individuals and ordinary consumers to activists, law enforcement, and
companies - is part of its security. Just learning that somebody
visited the Tor or Tails website doesn't tell you whether that person
is a journalist source, someone concerned that her Internet Service
Provider will learn about her health conditions, or just someone irked
that cat videos are blocked in her location. Trying to make a list of
Tor's millions of daily users certainly counts as wide scale
collection. Their attack on the bridge address distribution service
shows their "collect all the things" mentality - it's worth
emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like China
and Iran, and here we are finding out about attacks by our own
country. Does reading the contents of those mails violate the wiretap
act? Now I understand how the Google engineers felt when they learned
about the attacks on their infrastructure.â
NDR and WDR wanted to know from the NSA how it justified attacking a
service funded by the U.S. government, under what legal authority Tor
Network users are monitored, and whether the German government has any
knowledge of the targeting of servers in Germany. Instead of adressing
the questions repeatedly posed to them, the NSA provided the following
statement: "In carrying out its mission, NSA collects only what it is
authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence purposes -
regardless of the technical means used by foreign intelligence
targets. The communications of people who are not foreign intelligence
targets are of no use to the agency. In January, President Obama
issued U.S. Presidential Policy Directive 28, which affirms that all
persons - regardless of nationality - have legitimate privacy
interests in the handling of their personal information, and that
privacy and civil liberties shall be integral considerations in the
planning of U.S. signals intelligence activities. The president's
directive also makes clear that the United States does not collect
signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing or burdening
criticism or dissent, or for disadvantaging persons based on their
ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. XKeyscore is
an analytic tool that is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign
signals intelligence collection system. Such tools have stringent
oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. The
use of XKeyscore allows the agency to help defend the nation and
protect U.S. and allied troops abroad. All of NSA's operations are
conducted in strict accordance with the rule of law, including the
President's new directive."
However, the research contradicts the United States' promise to
Germany that German citizens are not surveiled without suspicion.
Using Tor in Germany does not justify targeting someone, the German
attorney Thomas Stadler states: "Tor users do not breach any laws, it
is absolutely legitimate to act anonymously on the internet. There are
many good reasons to remain anonymous."
What is deep packet inspection?
Deep Packet Inspection, or DPI, refers to the class of technology
which examines the content of data packets as they travel across a
network. A packet is the fundamental unit of transfer in packet
switched networks like the internet. While DPI is commonly used by
organizations to monitor their own networks, its use on public
networks for censorship and surveillance has been widely condemned by
privacy advocates and the United States government alike.
In 2012, the head of the U.S. Delegation to the World Conference on
International Telecommunications, U.S. Ambassador Terry Kramer, said
âsome companies have used deep packet inspection technologies to not
look at aggregate customer information, traffic information, et
cetera, but to look at individual customer information. So looking at
individuals and what sites theyâre on and how much capacity theyâre
using, et cetera, as you can imagine, weâre very much opposed to that
because we feel thatâs a violation of peopleâs privacy and gets into,
obviously, censorship, et ceteraâ.
Despite its public political condemnations of invasive DPI use, the
United States "Intelligence Community" and its "Five Eyes" partners
(Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) operate
massive internet-scale DPI systems themselves, including XKeyscore.
The use of XKeyscore is not limited to these partners, however. The
software has been shared with the German BND and BfV, as well as the
Swedish FRA, amongst others.
Active vs Passive
XKeyscore and the systems that feed it are considered "passive",
meaning that they silently listen but do not transmit anything on the
networks that they are targeting. However, through a process known as
"tipping", data from these programs can trigger other systems which
perform "active" attacks.
Quantum is a family of such programs, including Quantuminsert,
Quantumhand, Quantumtheory, Quantumbot, and Quantumcopper, which are
used for offensive computer intrusion. Turmoil, Quantum, and other
components of the Turbulence architecture are running at so-called
"defensive sites" including the Ramstein Air Force base in Germany,
Yokota Air Force base in Japan, and numerous military and non-military
locations within the United States.
Both Turmoil and XKeyscore feed selected data to real-time "tipping"
programs, such as Trafficthief, which can both alert NSA analysts when
their targets are communicating and trigger other software programs.
Selected data is "promoted" from the local XKeyscore data store to the
NSA's so-called "corporate repositories" for long term storage,
analysis and exploitation.
In 2013, the British newspaper The Guardian revealed that by 2008 more
than 150 internet surveillance facilities around the world were
running the XKeyscore Deep Packet Inspection software. All of the
internet traffic observed by XKeyscore, both metadata and full
content, is analyzed and stored temporarily at the collection sites
for periods ranging from days to weeks, while selected data is
forwarded on to other locations for long-term storage.
The storage, indexing, and querying functions are performed at or near
the collection sites because the volume of data being collected is too
large to forward everything back to facilities in other countries.
Analysts working from various locations around the world may search
specific XKeyscore sites, or send their queries to a collection of
XKeyscore provides a modular architecture in which tens of thousands
of small computer programs, or rules, written in XKeyscore's
specialized programming languages called Genesis and XKScript as well
as general-purpose languages such as C++ and Python, are run against
all traffic to categorize it and extract data. This indexing of the
"full take" allows analysts to query the temporary storage stored at
the XKeyscore site, effectively sifting through already pilfered
communications which occurred before they had deemed them interesting
for a specific reason.
XKeyscore can be fed by several different programs, including
Wealthycluster and Turmoil. These programs "sessionize" the data,
which means that individual connections, such as a request for a web
page, are reconstructed from the stream of intercepted packets.
Locations where the NSA runs XKeyscore include Special Source
Operations (SSO) sites, typically found at or near major
telecommunication providers' infrastructure; Special Collection
Service (SCS) sites, usually located inside diplomatic facilities like
embassies and consulates; and FORNSAT sites where satellite
communications are intercepted. All of these types of sites are known
to exist in Germany.
Other "Five Eyes" partners also operate XKeyscore installations. The
United Kingdom's Tempora program runs the largest instance of
XKeyscore. Both the software itself and limited access to NSA
databases have been shared with so-called "3rd party" partners
including Germany. The German foreign intelligence agency BND and the
domestic intelligence agency BfV are testing the Software.

NSA Hacks TOR in Germany, Calls Users Extremists
Original German: German named an extremist targeted by U.S. intelligence from the NSA
Published: 07.03.2014 05:00 clock
The NSA peeks specifically from German that deal with encryption on
the Internet. This emerges from a secret source, the NDR and WDR
exists. NSA victim can thus be identified by name. One of them is a
student from Erlangen.
By Lena Kampf, Jacob Appelbaum and John Goetz, NDR
[Images omitted.]
It is one of the most sensitive secrets of the NSA, the engine of the
global monitoring machine: the source code of the XKeyscore program,
the most comprehensive AusspÃ¤hprogramm of U.S. foreign intelligence.
NDR and WDR have excerpts of the source code. Parts of the collection
infrastructure ie, so-called software rules that define the
intelligence, what or who they want to investigate.
There are only a few numbers and characters to string together the
programmer. But when the program executes XKeyscore these rules, get
people and their data in their sights. The connections from computers
to the Internet are identified and stored in a database type. The
users are quasi marked. It is the dragnet of the 21st century.

Users of the Tor network aim of penetration
In the present source is about the spying infrastructure and the users
of the Tor network. Tor stands for "the onion router" - a program in
which Internet traffic, such as a query to a search engine, is passed
through various servers and lie encryption layers like an onion to
make the request. Thus, the origin of the request, so obscures the IP
address. The IP address is like a mailing address and reveals among
other things, the location of the computer.
There are about 5,000 Tor servers worldwide which are operated by
volunteers. It is an anonymizing infrastructure, which is often used,
especially in countries where it is dangerous to abandon the regime,
which websites you visited or where they retrieve. In Iran and Syria,
for example. Tor is used by journalists, human rights activists and
lawyers worldwide.
Popular German IP addresses in Fort Meade
The reporting of the "Guardian" on PowerPoint presentations from the
Snowden archive has shown in the past year that the Tor network the
NSA is a particular thorn in the side. The top-secret documents and
the first time published the source code show that the NSA is making
significant efforts to deanonymisieren users of the Tor network.
Search of the NDR and WDR show: German IP addresses are defined in the
source code of the NSA as a unique destination.
The IP 212 212 245 170 leads to a gray, factory-like building, whose
high walls are fenced with barbed wire. "On the Tower" is the street
in an industrial area near NÃ¼rnberg. There is a computer center with
Mietservern in long shelves. They all look the same. But one is spied
on by the NSA. Sebastian Hahn, a student and employee of the computer
science department in Erlangen has rented this server.
The program goal: TOR a thorn in the NSA.
Momentous commitment to the Internet community
In his spare time he is involved in the Tor network, as well as one of
the authors of this paper. The gate community trusts Sebastian Hahn
especially: He may run one of nine so-called "Directory Authorities".
On his server is a list, in which all Tor servers are listed. Users
who connect to the Tor network, automatically access to one of the
nine "Directory Authorities" to download the latest list. Hundreds of
thousands of hits a day there are at Sebastian Hahn.
All of these accesses are marked by the NSA and land according to
research by the NDR and WDR then in a special NSA database. In the
source code appeared even the name of the server on tap: "Gabelmoo"
had called him cock predecessor, Frankish for "fork man," as the
Bamberger call a Poseidon statue lovingly.
"This is shocking," says Hahn. Because: "The connection data of
millions of people are listed every day." Sebastian Hahn found next to
"Gabelmoo" all other names of "Directory Authorities" in Berlin, the
Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and the USA. They are also target of the
Second notably known NSA victims
Although he is only a means to an end for the NSA - finally, the
intelligence want to filter on its server who uses the Tor network -
Hahn feels violated his privacy. Because he wanted to do something
good, he random "in the focus of the intelligence agencies," he says,
visibly shocked. He is now probably after German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, the second known by name German surveillance victims of
American intelligence.
The lawyer specializing in IT law, Thomas Stadler, sees a "suspicion
of intelligence agents work". The Attorney General expressed only in
general terms: you examine all instructions. On request, the NSA
shares only generally, we consider strictly to the law: "privacy and

What you want to anonymize is deanonymized
Ironically, it is in accordance with the special rules that NDR and
WDR present, so just people with the desire for anonymity that are the
target of the NSA. In the eyes of the Secret Service: extremists. This
is not rhetoric, no journalistic escalation. The term is even in the
Comment column of the source text, quoted by programmers of the NSA.
Extremists? The opposite is the case, as the search point. The German
victims are politically to find not at the outer edge. Extreme they
are alone on one point: They are concerned about the security of their
data. And that's what makes them suspect in the eyes of the U.S.
Secret Service.
How quickly do you become a "Extremist"
"Tails" is an operating system that uses the Tor network to post on
the Internet any traces, but nothing saves the user on the computer
from which it is, for example, on a USB stick, booted.
Darko Medic, 18, short brown hair, sitting in front of his laptop. He
is "Tails" and "USB" in the mask its search engine. What Darko not
know: He's just so also landed in a database of the NSA. Marked as one
of the extremists, they seek the secret service so diligently.
Limitless espionage
How the NSA spying friends and enemies and the consequences of that.
Because what the rules of the source code also revealed: The NSA
observed on a large scale search queries worldwide - also in Germany.
Just the simple search for encryption software, such as "Tails" is
enough to get into the grid of the NSA. The connection of the request
with search engines makes suspicious. His search for "Tails" opens a
door, access to Darko and his world. Once in the database, any inquiry
from Darko can be accessed selectively. Darko is under observation.
This Darko has traveled in the computer-AG so he learns how to protect
themselves from the spying by the NSA. "I do not think anyone is
reading my e-mails," he says.
His seatmate has opened the website of the Tor project. His connection
to the site is now marked and stored in a database. For the entire Web
page of the Tor project is under observation. Everyone who visits
them, like the NeukÃ¶lln students ends with a marker.
The NSA peeks specifically from people who deal with encryption on the Internet.
It's not just about metadata
In addition, it can be shown beyond reasonable doubt through the
source code for the first time, that the NSA is not only so-called
metadata, ie connection data reads. According programming command,
e-mails used to connect to the Tor network, then the contents of the
so-called e-mail body, analyzed and stored. The relevant quote from
the source code reads: "email_body ('
c + + extractors"
William Binney, 70, was technical director of the NSA until he left in
2001 because the machines he invented, were directed against its own
people. Today he is testifying before the NSA Untersuchungssauschuss.
In an interview with NDR and WDR, he explains why the secret service
have calculated it apart to users of the Tor network: "There shall be
no free, anonymous rooms give," he says. "They want to know everything
about everyone."
Only a few are excluded: Registered in the source code, the NDR and
WDR exists, is the differentiation between the partner countries of
the United States, the so-called "Five Eyes", in New Zealand,
Australia, Britain and Canada, and other countries. Compounds that are
made from the "Five Eyes" countries on the Tor website, according to
the present rule should not be marked. From all other countries,
however, already. Without exception.

Frustrated by technically savvy privacy extremists using encryption to

The US announced new security measures last week, apparently in

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Carnegie Mellon Kills Black Hat Talk About Identifying Tor Users -- Perhaps
Because It Broke Wiretapping Laws
from the questionable-legality dept
There's some buzz in security circles today after it came out that a session
at the upcoming Black Hat Conference entitled "You Don't Have to be the NSA
to Break Tor: Deanonymizing Users on a Budget" by Michael McCord and
Alexander Volynkin (both of whom work for Carnegie-Mellon University and
CERT) had been pulled from the conference at the request of CMU.
A Black Hat spokeswoman told Reuters that the talk had been canceled at the
request of lawyers for Carnegie-Mellon University, where the speakers work as
researchers. A CMU spokesman had no immediate comment.
There's been plenty of speculation about what's going on, but Chris Soghoian
has a pretty good thesis that the researchers likely didn't have
institutional approval or consent of the users they were identifying, meaning
that they were potentially violating wiretapping statutes. As he notes,
running a Tor server to try to spy on Tor traffic without talking to lawyers
is a very bad idea. While it hasn't yet been confirmed that this is what
happened, it certainly is a pretty sensible theory.
Of course, none of that changes the fact that it's possible to identify some
Tor users. But... that's also not particularly new. In fact, we've discussed
in the past how the feds can identify Tor users. Tor adds an important layer
of protection, but there are plenty of ways that you can still be identified
while using Tor. Just ask Russ Ulbricht. The problem isn't so much Tor itself
but how people use it -- and the simple fact is that most people use it in a
way that will eventually reveal who they are. While it's not definite, it
seems likely that this is what the talk would have revealed. Shutting it down
wasn't any sort of big attempt to cover up this fact, but perhaps it was to
protect the researchers and CMU (potentially) from a lawsuit for violating
wiretapping laws.

'... nearly all Android devices equipped with Google Services

Previous research about sensor based attacks on Android platform
focused mainly on accessing or controlling over sensitive device
components, such as camera, microphone and GPS. These approaches get
data from sensors directly and need corresponding sensor invoking
This paper presents a novel approach (GVS-Attack) to launch permission
bypassing attacks from a zero permission Android application
(VoicEmployer) through the speaker. The idea of GVS-Attack utilizes an
Android system built-in voice assistant module -- Google Voice Search.
Through Android Intent mechanism, VoicEmployer triggers Google Voice
Search to the foreground, and then plays prepared audio files (like
"call number 1234 5678") in the background. Google Voice Search can
recognize this voice command and execute corresponding operations.
With ingenious designs, our GVS-Attack can forge SMS/Email, access
privacy information, transmit sensitive data and achieve remote
control without any permission.
Also we found a vulnerability of status checking in Google Search app,
which can be utilized by GVS-Attack to dial arbitrary numbers even
when the phone is securely locked with password. A prototype of
VoicEmployer has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of
GVS-Attack in real world. In theory, nearly all Android devices
equipped with Google Services Framework can be affected by GVS-Attack.
This study may inspire application developers and researchers rethink
that zero permission doesn't mean safety and the speaker can be
treated as a new attack surface.

The Department of Justice sees its takedown of the billion-dollar Silk
Road black market as a massive, victorious drug bust. Ross Ulbricht,
the alleged creator of that anonymous contraband bazaar, now wants to
cast the case in a different light: as a landmark example of the
government trampling privacy rights in the digital world.
In a pre-trial motion filed in the case late Friday night, Ulbrichtâs
lawyers laid out a series of arguments to dismiss all charges in the
case based on Ulbrichtâs fourth amendment protections against
warrantless searches of his digital property. As early as the FBIâs
initial discovery of servers in Iceland hosting the site on the Tor
anonymity networkâseemingly without obtaining a search warrant from a
judgeâUlbricht argues that law enforcement violated his constitutional
right to privacy, tainting all further evidence against him dug up in
the investigation that followed.
âThe [electronically stored information] and other material seized and
searched has been contaminated at its source, and at several later
points along the way, rendering the direct and indirect product of
those searches and seizures â in essence, the entire product of the
investigation itself â inadmissible,â a 102-page memo accompanying the
motion summarizes. âThus, the Fourth Amendment and relevant statutes
require suppression of the fruits of the searches and seizures, and
any evidence or other information derived therefrom.â
The motion refers to 14 distinct searches and seizures of Ulbrichtâs
computers, equipment, and online accounts. Beyond the initial tracing
of his alleged servers in Iceland, investigators performed several of
those surveillance operations with âtrap and traceâ or âpen registerâ
orders that donât require the âprobable causeâ standard necessary to
convince a judge to sign off on a warrant; The warrantless
surveillances ops included asking Comcast for information related to
Ulbrichtâs alleged IP address in San Francisco. And even in the cases
when investigators did get a warrant before performing their
searchesâas in the case of a Samsung laptop believed to belong to
Ulbricht as well as his Gmail and Facebook accountsâUlbrichtâs defense
argues that those warrants were unconstitutional âgeneral warrantsâ
that allowed a wholesale dump of his private data rather than allowing
the search for a specific piece of information.
âMany of the warrantsâ¦constitute the general warrants abhorred by the
Framers, and which led directly to the Fourth Amendment,â the memo
reads.  âThe wholesale collection and study of Mr. Ulbrichtâs entire
digital history without limitation â expressly sought in the warrants
and granted â represent the very type of indiscriminate rummaging that
caused the American colonists so much consternation.â
Ulbrichtâs memo isnât simply a demand to dismiss the charges against
him, which include conspiracy to traffic in narcotics, money
laundering, and a âkingpinâ statute often used against mob bosses and
drug cartel leaders. Itâs also a request for more information from
prosecutors. Despite the âdiscoveryâ process designed to give
defendants a chance to review the evidence against them, the memo says
that the government still hasnât revealed to Ulbricht or the public
many aspects of the investigation. The most crucial of those
information gaps is just how the FBI located the Silk Roadâs servers
despite the anonymity protections provided by cryptographic software
âAll of the searches and seizures are predicated upon the governmentâs
infiltration of the alleged âSilk Road Servers,ââ reads the memo.
âHowever, that event â location of the Silk Road Servers â is shrouded
in mystery, as the means and manner in which that discovery was
accomplished has not been disclosed.â
If that initial pinpointing and penetration of Ulbrichtâs alleged
serversâwhether by the FBI, the NSA, or investigators with the means
of defeating Torâs privacy safeguardsâis determined to be
unconstitutional, the defense argues it could contaminate virtually
all of the prosecutionâs other evidence. It points to what it calls
the âfruit of a poisonous treeâ doctrine, stating that an improper
search can invalidate all subsequent searches based on evidence found
in the initial step. And it notes that the requests to judges for
warrants in other steps of the fedsâ investigation didnât explain or
even mention that initial discovery of the Silk Roadâs computers in
The memo backs up its argument by referring to several recent fourth
amendment decisions, most notably the case of Riley vs. California, in
which the Supreme Court ruled that a police canât search a arrested
suspectâs phone without a warrant due to the massive amount of private
data that sort of digital device contains. It also points to another
case in which Microsoft was ordered to respond to a search warrant for
emails belonging to one of its users, even though the emails were
stored on a foreign server. Ulbrichtâs defense points to that second
case as a demonstration that the government ought to seek a warrant
even when the information itâs seeking is stored abroad, as in the
case of the Silk Roadâs Icelandic servers.
âThe government has not provided any reason why it could not have
pursued, and why it was not obligated under its own theory of the
scope of [the law], to pursue the same avenue â a warrant â for
obtaining the [electronic stored information] on the Silk Road
Server,â the memo reads.
Aside from its Fourth Amendment arguments, the memo makes an unrelated
request: That the prosecution stop calling Ulbricht a murderer. In its
criminal complaint and pre-trial arguments, the prosecution has
referred repeatedly to Ulbrichtâs alleged attempts to pay for the
murder of six people, including what the prosecutors describe as a
potential informant against him and a blackmailer. But despite the
fact that Ulbricht still faces a separate murder-for-hire case in
Maryland, he hasnât been charged with any such killings in the current
Southern District of New York case. The defense argues that means the
prosecutionâs murder references are âunduly prejudicialâ and violate
Ulbrichtâs right to a fair trial.
Those murder charges have weighed heavily on Ulbrichtâs reputation,
draining support for a young defendant who might have otherwise been a
cause celebre for privacy and personal freedomsâafter all, the Silk
Roadâs creator who called himself the âDread Pirate Robertsâ preached
a libertarian philosophy of âvictimlessâ crime and civil disobedience.
With his latest motion, that alleged âpirateâ is taking another,
well-timed shot at elevating his case beyond one of a cybercriminal
drug kingpinâthis time to a story of illegal government surveillance.

 - Verizon reprogrammed the device so that when an incoming voice call
arrived, the card would disconnect from any legitimate cell tower to
which it was already connected, and send real-time cell-site location
data to Verizon, which forwarded the data to the FBI. This allowed the
FBI to position its stingray in the neighborhood where Rigmaiden
resided. The stingray then âbroadcast a very strong signalâ to force
the air card into connecting to it, instead of reconnecting to a
legitimate cell tower, so that agents could then triangulate signals
coming from the air card and zoom-in on Rigmaidenâs location.
To make sure the air card connected to the FBIâs simulator, Rigmaiden
says that Verizon altered his air cardâs Preferred Roaming List so
that it would accept the FBIâs stingray as a legitimate cell site and
not a rogue site, and also changed a data table on the air card
designating the priority of cell sites so that the FBIâs fake site was
at the top of the list.
 - the second "data table on the air card ... designating the priority
of cell sites" not unambiguous. for example, System Determination

Hi everyone
I want to announce to the list that a new release of tor-ramdisk is
out. Tor-ramdisk is an i686 or x86_64 uClibc-based micro Linux
distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an
environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced
by hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by
forcing logging to be off at all levels so that even the Tor operator
only has access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs
in ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the
Tor configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP or SCP.
tor was updated to 0.2.4.23 which addresses CVE-2014-5117.  The kernel
was updated to 3.15.7+ Gentoo's hardened-patches-3.15.7-1.extras.  All
other packages are the same as the previous release.  It is
recommended that users upgrade immediately.  For more information see

The Preferred Roaming List Zero Intercept Attack
# SUMMARY #
Attackers in position to carry out Monkey-in-the-Middle against
CDMA2000 links between customer stations and their carrier BTS
equipment can leverage silent push PRL updates to apply a routing list
preferring paths through malicious "tower(s)" carrying the subscriber
voice and data traffic under threat. The use of a specific PRL version
Zero (0), aka Preferred Roaming List Zero Intercept Attack, implements
the rogue tower associations with least potential interference to
legit carrier bands and devices present in broadcast domain of attack.
The presence of PRL version zero (0) on a device indicates malfunction
at best and potential maliciousness when supported by other confirming
factors. Note that malicious changes to the PRL may happen out of band
(at baseband / control plane) regardless of disabled update facilities
on the Android, iOS, or other device operating system. Polling must be
used to detect silent forced PRL updates at the version level.
# IMPACT #
All common smart phones deployed on Verizon, Sprint, MetroPCS, US
Cellular, and Telus carrier networks appear to support silent force
push PRL with insufficient authorization.
Any carrier phones or specific builds known to not accept PRL updates
without authorization should be noted in response to this thread and
the author with specific radio and carrier details. Software defined
CDMA2000 implementations observed to date unaffected as manual tower
associations are usually required in these systems.
# RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS #
1. Smart phone platforms and OEM distributions should refuse to
silently downgrade or set to version zero (0) any PRL updates.
Versions always increment, an offset sequence is a signal of something
amiss and must require user confirmation to execute overrides.
2. Manufacturers should pressure baseband vendors for strong controls
around PRL updates similar to controls around signed firmware updates
and defense in depth like TrustZone enforced PRL management. In
addition, preferred only bit set (use only preferred systems) should
be the default, not the exception.
3. Privacy conscious consumers should communicate via software defined
radio stacks rather than proprietary baseband black boxes. Full
control over all channels, forward, reverse, supplementary and the
content within them compelling transparency for radio comms.
4. Hackers at DEF CON should create apps to monitor for PRL zero
status and securely report the results to a hidden site. Unauthorized
PRL changes should then force radios off (airplane mode or cell radios
down) and trigger counter measures.
# BACKGROUND #
asking for disclosure or utility seems not unreasonable. [0][1] far
from a free for all these days, for sure, ... the rest of the rant
after this regularly scheduled programming: [2]
# VULNERABILITY ASPECTS #
- Vulnerability Classes: Improper Access Control
- Remotely Exploitable: Yes
- Locally Exploitable: Yes; most devices
- Authentication Required: No; only middle position
# TECHNICAL DETAIL #
Working knowledge of CDMA2000 network principles and protocols is assumed.
Explicit PRL updates as may be invoked via dialing  on
Sprint, *228 for Verizon - then opt. 2, or *228 on many other networks
are user initiated and properly authorized. Over-the-Air system update
facilities on carrier networks may also silently force push PRL
updates to customers for better service, as intended, with
incrementing versions.
When used maliciously, OTA PRL updates with a version of zero (0)
function well as in-scope target enabling, having the property that
once a target leaves the broadcast area under attack the legitimate
carrier update, no matter which real carrier or intervening time
period, will always be great than zero, and thus replace the transient
malicious roaming list with a legitimate copy of whatever is current.
It is this specific aspect: silent force PRL downgrade to version zero
(0) which is condemened. Any other aspects of securely communicating
provider preferences to customer devices is left as a problem for the
reader; CDMA designed to protect carrier base stations and networks,
not subscribers from a rogue "carrier".
Consider the following original roaming configuration for a device
subject to this attack:
The attacker desires least interruption to carrier SIDs ...0A, 12, 15,
and associated frequencies.  Attacker assumes operations on channels
650 and 725 with SID 0x00A1 to co-exist with incidental communications
inside the broadcast domain under attack.
With the new rogue station operating, a Preferred Roaming List Zero
attack can now be mounted, routing targets over the malicious base
stations as long as they remain in range of attacker.
Such a roaming configuration may look like:
One last note: It is useful to be alerting on scenarios where channel
drops, and strong neighbor appears just outside SRCH_WIN_N with a hard
hand-off. Investigation of the exchange in detail warranted, in
addition to any control messages that followed.
# DISCLOSURE PERSPECTIVE #
- "State Level" attackers using since before 2008? [how long before?]
- Observed "in the wild" 2011.
- Paying Fyodor's FD Tithe to public at Fri Aug 1 10:58:20 UTC 2014,
plus moderation delay.
# ADDITIONAL INFORMATION #
Will not be coming from this channel. This includes no press; sorry.
Third parties encouraged to continue and disseminate additional
inquiry, however!
# SOLICITED INFORMATION FOR BENEFIT OF OTHERS #
- Are R-UIM based devices affected by force PRL zero?
- Can knob frobbing mitigate successfully on carrier devices without
root'ing or jailbreak'ing? [PCS, WCDMA, other radio opts]
- If you force closed loop power control with constrained codings, can
you thwart the effectiveness of attackers using mobile or non-tower
- Will Metasploit deploy GNU CDMA blocks for this and other attacks
along with requisite faraday tents?
# FOR WANT OF CITES #
0.  - i remember Fyodor asking that inflamatory off-topics at least be
combined with a disclosure of some technical merit, too.  as a way to
atone for wasting precious minutes squandered and never to return;
alas i can't find the message on a cursory search.  i don't have a
problem with this policy (Vuln for Voice) but it does seem to raise a
high bar! *grin*
1. "Meta: List moderation", "Request to mailing list Fulldisclosure
rejected", etc.
  - 2. # RESUME RANT #
 - this is in reference to [3] which is actually the gist of my angst.
public and named individuals, organizations, institutions overly risk
averse. prosecutorial zeal into the absurd squelching independent
research while proprietary malcode monopolies from intelligence
community to private sector weaponizers fleece talent into
un-disclosure prisons with mental inhibitors decades to the future.
we're in a strange new future now, and i have no idea what role full
disclosure has in it, if any.

SENTER Sandman: Using Intel TXT to Attack BIOSes
 - At CanSecWest 2014 we presented the first prototype of Copernicus 2, a
trustworthy BIOS capture system. It was undertaken specifically to
combat our âSmiteâem the Stealthyâ PoC which can forge the BIOS
collection results from all other systems (including our own
Copernicus 1, the open source Flashrom, Intel Chipsec, etc).
Copernicus 2 makes use of the open source Flicker project from Jon
McCune of CMU which utilizes Intel Trusted Execution Technology in
order to build a trustworthy environment from which to run our BIOS
measurement code. We specifically chose TXT because it has the ability
to disable System Management Interrupts (SMIs) effectively putting the
SMM MitM, Smiteâem, to sleep.
But if youâve been following our work (specifically âDefeating Signed
BIOS Enforcementâ and âSetup for Failure: Defeating UEFI SecureBootâ)
you will have seen that we have two other attacks where we leverage
the ability to suppress SMIs to break into some BIOSes. Thus the
Sandman cometh! We will explain how we could implement the PoC Sandman
attack using the same infrastructure as Copernicus 2. We will also
explain what can be done against this kind of attack, and how the
latest Copernicus 2 attempts to prevent opening the door to the
Sandman. We will also cover how Copernicus 1 and 2 can check for the
problems with BIOSes that make SMI-suppression attacks feasible, how
to tell if youâre vulnerable, and what you may be able to do about it.

first and foremost:
WPA2 does NOT prevent an adversary able to inject packets at you from
downgrading crypto to flawed RC4. due to odd forgotten legacy protocol
bits, every implementation of WPA2 that i have tested is vulnerable to
an active downgrade to TKIP/RC4 while still being "WPA2" and still
showing all signs of using strongest security settings.
let me re-iterate: _WPA2 only_ as a setting on router or client device
does not prevent an active RC4 downgrade when using WPA2. AES-CCMP
must be explicitly checked for, and this is not straightforward in
end-user configuration or management utilities.
RECOMMENDATION: use a wireless packet capture utility to specifically
check for and alert on the presence of TKIP in a WPA2 session. this
never happens under legitimate circumstances. [if you know of one,
please tell me!]
TKIP in WPA2 == Active injection attack by "well funded" adversary[0]
i missed the renewed speculation that periodically swirls around RC4, e.g.
"I feel but cannot prove that the day is coming when we learn that
everything we ever encrypted with RC4 is very practical to decrypt"
 - "Kind of annoyed SHA-1 is a "crypto emergency" when most of the web
was encrypted with RC4 last year and almost no one cared"
 - "This attack also applies directly to WPA/TKIP, with similar success
rates, because of its use of per-packet keys for RC4. Here, the
particular structure of WPA/TKIP keys means that a different set of
biases are obtained in the first 256 bytes of RC4 keystream... For
WPA/TKIP, the only reasonable countermeasure is to upgrade to WPA2."
 - i have an advisory pending to full-disclosure with details on this
WPA2 force downgrade to TKIP attack and a rant about Kaminsky's DEF
CON 22 talk. advisory includes timeline indicating "in the wild"
discovery of this technique late 2013.  any earlier indications
to be clear, this issue is with backwards compatibility in WPA2, and
the manner in which a local attacker (8 miles or more with power and
directional emission) can force the WPA2 protected session to use
TKIP/RC4 while appearing to both client and network management
equipment to be using WPA2 and best security configuration. (not WEP,
not WPA)
this is not about how RC4 is broken; i have no idea about the nature
of the RC4 weaknesses enabling decryption, and this as yet unknown
attack is certainly more effective than the attack described in

a legitimate roaming association when out of normal coverage areas is
different from what could be called an "intercept attack".  that is to
say, actively placing an intercept channel in front of a station when
that station is able to associate with legitimate carrier towers is an
active attack against carrier networks, while a roaming association
when out of range of carrier is a desired function and not malicious.
to complicate matters, a number of years back i reported on active
MitM attacks on 4G networks by interfering with existing associations
to force a roaming hand-off to attacker endpoint.  thus a
determination of what is "normal" perspective to carrier towers
requires a span of time combined with local observation. (snapshots
not sufficient)
also, the new broadband back-haul'ed femtocells that some carriers are
distributing may or may not appear as an impersonating interceptor,
exhibiting the usual properties of a rogue tower while actually being
carrier provisioned capacity.
this is an interesting question.  presumably there are two reasons: a)
that the usual intercepts require judicial approval and logistic
delays, and b) manipulating the local link and signaling channel
affords deep "enabling" of the target via means not cleared to transit
untrusted networks.
fun questions, encourage more research!

this is totally marketing oriented, as the traditional "baseband"
attack is arbitrary code execution within the baseband processor
embedded system rather than opportunistic advantage of inherent
signaling and authentication weaknesses in protocol implementations.
the latter can be "weaponized" by nearly anyone with a full duplex
SDR. the former is usually accomplished with insider access or
painstaking expertise - the opposite of accessible.
if you read between the lines you can see how they classify any tower
aggressively peering stations in range as "baseband intercept attack"
for their maximal PR purposing.

Giganews Denial Campaign
Orchestrated PR against every leaker is to demonize: call the leaker a
sad case who needs psychiatric help, whose life style is scrutinized
for damning behavior aided by fabricated ruses and testimonies against
the leaker.
Officials, CEOs, lawyers, co-workers are set in motion to slur,
ridicule, laugh at, scowl at, condemn, smear, pity and rage against
the leaker. Retractions and redactions are demanded to protect he
innocent. But never admit the truth of the leaks until after more
leaks, then grudingly, with shallow apologies, layer by layer as the
leaking continues.
Attacks are initiated on the leaker's outlets and supporters, accusing
them of being duped and hoaxed, demand that they too recant and admit
being taken in by a crafty operator who did not understand the full
picture, and was not a reliable worker.
This is the pattern of cover-up, and it is widespread among
malefactors working the same territory of duping the public on behalf
of the government, usually after themselves being entrapped by
officials and extorted into becoming informers and co-conspirators
with officials. And if all goes well handsome contracts are used to
cement the malefaction as a part of successful business of betrayal.
This is what Nick Caputo revealed of Giganews, this is what Giganews
must deny as formulaicly denied by Stratfor, by HG Gary, by Sabu, by
Google, by Microsoft, by NSA, by DoJ, by FBI, on and on.
 15 September 2014
Giganews Is an FBI operation
Let me explain my history at Giganews in Austin, Texas and how I
learned about the FBI connection. I used to be a huge fan of Usenet
and a customer of different newsgroup providers for several years, and
I started working at Giganews in 2009. I rose through the company,
being promoted to a system technician after 6 months, and became a
Giganews system engineer less than two years after that.
A huge pirate at the time, I loved the idea of helping people download
all the "rich multimedia content" they could. The porn content is not
safe on Usenet, and the groups with children being abused I find
abhorrent. Customers would write in about it all the time, so its no
secret to a Usenet employee where it is.
Data Foundry is a data center company which is interconnected to
Giganews with the same admins, nocs, etc. Their main office
headquarters is at 1044 Liberty Park Dr in Austin. But, they host most
of the Usenet content in other data centers around the world. While
talking to the CEO of the entire operation, Ron Yokubaitis, I heard
what I interpreted as his request to remove the child pornography
groups when he asked, "Would you delete child porn?" I honestly loved
the thought of removing that junk off of Usenet, and removed three cp
newsgroups soon afterwards. This happened December 11th, 2011. I
didn't remove anything related to the normal and more socially
acceptable content Usenet downloaders know about.
It turned out that that wasn't what the CEO really wanted, who then
claimed he forgot what he said. The Giganews/Data Foundry admins
Philip Molter and Mike Smith disciplined me for removing the child
porn groups and didn't trust me to keep working there afterwards. They
made subtle references to jeopardizing criminal investigations IN
PROGRESS then threatened me with a bad reference for removing the
child abuse junk. No big deal, a bad reference from them after doing
that is good, but Philip restored the cp content from a backup I
didn't have access to.
Fast forward several months, I turned into a traitor in an effort to
remove the abhorrent junk off Usenet - I broke the first and second
rules not to talk about it, and told the FBI the truth about the child
abuse groups deletion in an email. This probably wont go over well
with internet freedom lovers, but sharing what I learned in the
experience will, I promise. My seemingly traitorous act exposed the
real traitor, the biggest one, to the Usenet network.
The FBI invited me to their unlisted Austin office in a nondescript
office building at 12515 Research Blvd, Building 7, Suite 400 in late
October 2012. Two agents took notes on what I told them, then
something unexpected happened. Special Agent Scott Kibbey told me he
personally knew the Giganews / Data Foundry CEO, bragged to me about
working there, then invited me back to Giganews! I had also helped
them with a separate crime venue in Austin that Data Foundry was going
to compete with, so I had earned their trust. In addition, Kibbey
offered me a new name and identity, with a new drivers license and
everything, if I were to go back to work at Giganews.
It was then that I realized that the fed I was talking to had been my
coworker at Giganews since I started in 2009! The other agent was
actually an Austin police detective named Charles Riley helping the
FBI whom worked alternate shifts to me at the Datafoundry NOC under
alias. Riley even bragged about being a detective once at a shift
change! The thought of my fellow Usenet systech in crime being a
police detective was unthinkable at the time. I've included some of
the emails from these feds (with email headers and IP addresses) in
the link at end.
Special Agent Scott Kibbey is central to the whole Giganews operation,
including Data Foundry, but with different names. This agent is a top
exec for Data Foundry, a top admin for Giganews, the Golden Frog front
company run from the same Usenet servers for VyprVPN, and the other
Usenet fronts Usenet.net, Supernews, Rhino Newsgroups, and
Powerusenet. Another business front name they used when I was there is
Powerhouse Management. Kibbey rolled out the OS images, kernels,
patches, setup the entire VyprVPN service including the detailed
logging which is easily accessible to him and the other government
agents working there.
There were also rumors agents from other governments worked thereÃ The
Hong Kong Giganews servers were brought down in early June 2009 by a
Chinese employee, the day of the Tiananmen Square anniversary when the
Chinese government was blocking everything online. This means the
VyprVPN connecting IP addresses are accessible to the Chinese
government indirectly through this employee. Anyone using the VyprVPN
service that governments are targeting is in danger, honestly.
This is my warning - that all of the content being downloaded and
shared on the Usenet network is going through the authorities!
Giganews customers are being logged! The log file is called the
"gigauth" on their "cruncher" servers which logs every connection by
every customer, which are then archived. This means Usenet uploaders
are helping the feds monitor the distribution of Usenet content if
their newsgroup provider peers with Giganews!
I swear to you that Giganews is an operation that employs federal
agents who run most of the operation. I suggest demanding from your
newsgroup provider that they stop the peering of binary groups to
FBI's Giganews. Please understand how risky this is for me to explain
as Agent Kibbey subtly threatened my family on behalf of Data Foundry
the second time I met both agents at the Austin FBI office. The
traitors saw me as a threat and said I did not cooperate. Even with
this threat, please warn Giganews customers and other Usenet users,
and use the evidence I've linked. If the google drive link dies, email
me for a new one. Agents Kibbey and Riley did not let me photograph
them, but I did include a scan of their business cards. Riley didn't
have an FBI badge or card, but he had an fbi.gov email address, ip,
and Austin Police Department badge.
I've linked pictures of my Giganews badge and the shirts with their
red armor logo I was forced to wear when working there. I've also
linked to the Giganews/Data Foundry employee list with in-office mug
shots, phone numbers and emails they gave me. I did not agree to
return this on their employee paperwork, so it is not illegal to
share. They thought I did, though. I doubt the names and phone numbers
they used internally are all real, as many are likely aliases and
fed-routed voip proxies. Most of the emails changed to goldenfrog.com
before I left from the ones listed in the 2011 employee pdf. Some of
the mugshots are photoshopped by them, as the pictures did not match
the physical appearance of some, likely to hide in case of someone
like me exposing these traitors.
Feel free to upload this to any newsgroup that Giganews carries -
Their customers need to know.

there is a third option: innocently overlooked.
it is unreasonable of me to assume that lack of prompt corrections is
intentional, as the research is older and not recently updated.
it is unreasonable of me to assume that the lack of awareness
regarding TKIP in WPA2 is widely known, as only driver implementations
and packet disassemblers appear to act on these optional elements.
it is unreasonable of me to repay actual research implementing attacks

a considered and insightful response to my saber rattling diatribe.
i owe you a beer, sir!
let's try another example: Intel RDRAND or RDSEED.  depend on it as
the sole source of entropy?
in theory, the only attacks that would allow to manipulate the output
are outside scope. (e.g. the data shows them as nation state level
is "depending on a single entropy source" the "known-crap" part? or is
it the un-verifiable output of this specific source that is
(or am i overreaching, and you advocate direct and sole use of RDRAND
everywhere? :)
if RC4 is known-crap, then how is a downgrade to known-crap not a problem?
consider a service provider that i use, like Google, with a
hypothetical 1024 bit RSA key to secure TLS. they don't use forward
secrecy, so recovery of their private key can recover content.
what is the risk that a Google-like provider key could be attacked? i
have no idea.  but certainly more than my risk as a single individual.
regarding open surveillance, this is a potential mechanism for it
despite the appearance of privacy.
at what point does an insufficient key length become "known-crap" vs.
needless lemming craziness?
said another way, "the data" is only useful if you or those you trust
is not an outlier.  in addition, "the data" is only retrospective; by
definition class breaks and novel attacks are not worth considering
until they become known and used.  does the difficulty in migrating
away from a new-known-crap mistake factor into how you draw the line?
microsoft updates are not the standard upon which to measure all
application updates. the vast majority don't check certificates or
secure digests at all, hence the hundreds of vectors in evilgrade that
provide a seamless path from MitM at coffee shop to administrator on
your laptop.
is the "not using crypto" or "not using crypto right" parts the
"known-crap" piece of this equation?
is the MitM or DNS poison dependency "low risk" enough per the data
that the "known crap" of the update itself no longer matters?
thank you taking the time to address these points in depth so that i
can better understand your reasoning.
this is an interesting discussion because i arrived at the opposite
conclusion: given the reasonableness of long keys and secure designs,
and in view of ever improving attacks, the best course of action is to
solve _once_ for the hardest threat model, so that you don't rely on
past indicators to predict future security and all lesser threat
models can benefit from the protection provided.
i dream of a future where the sudden development of very many qubit
computers does not cause a panic to replace key infrastructure or
generate new keys. where the protocols have only one mode, and it is
secure. where applications don't need to be updated frequently for
security reasons. where entire classes of vulnerabilities don't exist.
in short, i dream of a future where the cooperative solution to the
most demanding threat models is pervasive, to the benefit of all
lesser models, now and into the future.
best regards,
P.S. part of the context for this bias is my perspective as developer
of fully decentralized systems. any peer in such a system is
potentially the highest profile target; the threat model for any peer
the most demanding threat model any one peer may operate under. the
usual "client vs. server", or "casual vs. professional" distinctions
in threat models no longer apply...

Core Secrets: NSA Saboteurs in China and Germany
By Peter Maass and Laura Poitras
The National Security Agency has had agents in China, Germany, and
South Korea working on programs that use âphysical subversionâ to
infiltrate and compromise networks and devices, according to documents
obtained by The Intercept.
The documents, leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, also
indicate that the agency has used âunder coverâ operatives to gain
access to sensitive data and systems in the global communications
industry, and that these secret agents may have even dealt with
American firms. The documents describe a range of clandestine field
activities that are among the agencyâs âcore secretsâ when it comes to
computer network attacks, details of which are apparently shared with
only a small number of officials outside the NSA.
âItâs something that many people have been wondering about for a long
time,â said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist for the American
Civil Liberties Union, after reviewing the documents. âIâve had
conversations with executives at tech companies about this precise
thing. How do you know the NSA is not sending people into your data
Previous disclosures about the NSAâs corporate partnerships have
focused largely on U.S. companies providing the agency with vast
amounts of customer data, including phone records and email traffic.
But documents published today by The Intercept suggest that even as
the agency uses secret operatives to penetrate them, companies have
also cooperated more broadly to undermine the physical infrastructure
of the internet than has been previously confirmed.
In addition to so-called âclose accessâ operations, the NSAâs âcore
secretsâ include the fact that the agency works with U.S. and foreign
companies to weaken their encryption systems; the fact that the NSA
spends âhundreds of millions of dollarsâ on technology to defeat
commercial encryption; and the fact that the agency works with U.S.
and foreign companies to penetrate computer networks, possibly without
the knowledge of the host countries. Many of the NSAâs core secrets
concern its relationships to domestic and foreign corporations.
Some of the documents in this article appear in a new documentary,
CITIZENFOUR, which tells the story of the Snowden disclosures and is
directed by Intercept co-founder Laura Poitras. The documents describe
a panoply of programs classified with the rare designation of
âExceptionally Compartmented Information,â or ECI, which are only
disclosed to a âvery selectâ number of government officials.
Sentry Eagle
The agencyâs core secrets are outlined in a 13-page âbrief sheetâ
about Sentry Eagle, an umbrella term that the NSA used to encompass
its most sensitive programs âto protect Americaâs cyberspace.â
âYou are being indoctrinated on Sentry Eagle,â the 2004 document
begins, before going on to list the most highly classified aspects of
its various programs. It warns that the details of the Sentry Eagle
programs are to be shared with only a âlimited numberâ of people, and
even then only with the approval of one of a handful of senior
intelligence officials, including the NSA director.
âThe facts contained in this program constitute a combination of the
greatest number of highly sensitive facts related to NSA/CSSâs overall
cryptologic mission,â the briefing document states. âUnauthorized
disclosureâ¦will cause exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national
security. The loss of this information could critically compromise
highly sensitive cryptologic U.S. and foreign relationships,
multi-year past and future NSA investments, and the ability to exploit
foreign adversary cyberspace while protecting U.S. cyberspace.â
The document does not provide any details on the identity or number of
government officials who were supposed to know about these highly
classified programs. Nor is it clear what sort of congressional or
judicial oversight, if any, was applied to them. The NSA refused to
comment beyond a statement saying, âIt should come as no surprise that
NSA conducts targeted operations to counter increasingly agile
adversaries.â The agency cited Presidential Policy Directive 28, which
it claimed ârequires signals intelligence policies and practices to
take into account the globalization of trade, investment and
information flows, and the commitment to an open, interoperable, and
secure global Internet.â The NSA, the statement concluded, âvalues
these principles and honors them in the performance of its mission.â
Sentry Eagle includes six programs: Sentry Hawk (for activities
involving computer network exploitation, or spying), Sentry Falcon
(computer network defense), Sentry Osprey (cooperation with the CIA
and other intelligence agencies), Sentry Raven (breaking encryption
systems), Sentry Condor (computer network operations and attacks), and
Sentry Owl (collaborations with private companies). Though marked as a
draft from 2004, it refers to the various programs in language
indicating that they were ongoing at the time, and later documents in
the Snowden archive confirm that some of the activities were going on
as recently as 2012.
One of the most interesting components of the âcore secretsâ involves
an array of clandestine activities in the real world by NSA agents
working with their colleagues at the CIA, FBI, and Pentagon. The NSA
is generally thought of as a spying agency that conducts its espionage
from afarâvia remote commands, cable taps, and malware implants that
are overseen by analysts working at computer terminals. But the agency
also participates in a variety of âhuman intelligenceâ programs that
are grouped under the codename Sentry Osprey. According to the
briefing documentâs description of Sentry Osprey, the NSA âemploys its
own HUMINT assets (Target ExploitationâTAREX) to support SIGINT
According to a 2012 classification guide describing the program, TAREX
âconducts worldwide clandestine Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)
close-access operations and overt and clandestine Human Intelligence
(HUMINT) operations.â The NSA directs and funds the operations and
shares authority over them with the Armyâs Intelligence and Security
Command. The guide states that TAREX personnel are âintegratedâ into
operations conducted by the CIA, FBI, and Defense Intelligence Agency.
It adds that TAREX operations include âoff net-enabling,â âsupply
chain-enabling,â and âhardware implant-enabling.â
According to another NSA document, off-net operations are âcovert or
clandestine field activities,â while supply-chain operations are
âinterdiction activities that focus on modifying equipment in a
targetâs supply chain.â
The NSAâs involvement in supply-chain interdiction was previously
revealed in No Place to Hide, written by Intercept co-founder Glenn
Greenwald. The book included a photograph of intercepted packages
being opened by NSA agents, and an accompanying NSA document explained
the packages were âredirected to a secret locationâ where the agents
implanted surveillance beacons that secretly communicated with NSA
computers. The document did not say how the packages were intercepted
and did not suggest, as the new documents do, that interception and
implants might be done by clandestine agents in the field.
The TAREX guide lists South Korea, Germany, and Beijing, China as
sites where the NSA has deployed a âforward-based TAREX presence;â
TAREX personnel also operate at domestic NSA centers in Hawaii, Texas,
and Georgia. It also states that TAREX personnel are assigned to U.S.
embassies and other âoverseas locations,â but does not specify where.
The document does not say what the âforward-basedâ personnel are
doing, or how extensive TAREX operations are. But China, South Korea,
and Germany are all home to large telecommunications equipment
manufacturers, and China is known to be a key target of U.S.
intelligence activities.
Although TAREX has existed for decades, until now there has been
little information in the public domain about its current scope. A
2010 book by a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, Lt. Col.
Anthony Shaffer, described TAREX operations in Afghanistan as
consisting of âsmall-unit, up-close, intelligence-gathering
operatives. Usually two-to-three man units.â
âUnder Coverâ Agents
The most controversial revelation in Sentry Eagle might be a fleeting
reference to the NSA infiltrating clandestine agents into âcommercial
entities.â The briefing document states that among Sentry Eagleâs most
closely guarded components are âfacts related to NSA personnel (under
cover), operational meetings, specific operations, specific
technology, specific locations and covert communications related to
SIGINT enabling with specific commercial entities (A/B/C).â
It is not clear whether these âcommercial entitiesâ are American or
foreign or both. Generally the placeholder â(A/B/C)â is used in the
briefing document to refer to American companies, though on one
occasion it refers to both American and foreign companies. Foreign
companies are referred to with the placeholder â(M/N/O).â The NSA
refused to provide any clarification to The Intercept.
The document makes no other reference to NSA agents working under
cover. It is not clear whether they might be working as full-time
employees at the âcommercial entities,â or whether they are visiting
commercial facilities under false pretenses. The CIA is known to use
agents masquerading as businessmen, and it has used shell companies in
the U.S. to disguise its activities.
There is a long history of overt NSA involvement with American
companies, especially telecommunications and technology firms. Such
firms often have employees with security clearances who openly
communicate with intelligence agencies as part of their duties, so
that the government receives information from the companies that it is
legally entitled to receive, and so that the companies can be alerted
to classified cyber threats. Often, such employees have previously
worked at the NSA, FBI, or the military.
But the briefing document suggests another category of employeesâones
who are secretly working for the NSA without anyone else being aware.
This kind of double game, in which the NSA works with and against its
corporate partners, already characterizes some of the agencyâs work,
in which information or concessions that it desires are
surreptitiously acquired if corporations will not voluntarily comply.
The reference to âunder coverâ agents jumped out at two security
experts who reviewed the NSA documents for The Intercept.
âThat one bullet point, itâs really strange,â said Matthew Green, a
cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University. âI donât know how to
interpret it.â He added that the cryptography community in America
would be surprised and upset if it were the case that âpeople are
inside [an American] company covertly communicating with NSA and they
are not known to the company or to their fellow employees.â
The ACLUâs Soghoian said technology executives are already deeply
concerned about the prospect of clandestine agents on the payroll to
gain access to highly sensitive data, including encryption keys, that
could make the NSAâs work âa lot easier.â
âAs more and more communications become encrypted, the attraction for
intelligence agencies of stealing an encryption key becomes
irresistible,â he said. âItâs such a juicy target.â
Of course the NSA is just one intelligence agency that would stand to
benefit from these operations. Chinaâs intelligence establishment is
believed to be just as interested in penetrating American companies as
the NSA is believed to be interested in penetrating Chinese firms.
âThe NSA is a risk [but] I worry a lot more about the Chinese,â said
Matthew Prince, chief executive of CloudFlare, a server company. âThe
insider threat is a huge challenge.â Prince thinks it is unlikely the
NSA would place secret agents inside his or other American firms, due
to political and legal issues. âI would be surprised if that were the
case within any U.S. organization without at least a senior executive
like the CEO knowing it was happening,â he said. But he assumes the
NSA or CIA are doing precisely that in foreign companies. âI would be
more surprised if they didnât,â he said.
Corporate Partners
The briefing sheetâs description of Sentry Owl indicates the NSA has
previously unknown relationships with foreign companies. According to
the document, the agency âworks with specific foreign partners (X/Y/Z)
and foreign commercial industry entitiesâ to make devices and products
âexploitable for SIGINTââa reference to signals intelligence, which is
the heart of the NSAâs effort to collect digital communications, such
as emails, texts, photos, chats, and phone records. This language
clarifies a vague reference to foreign companies that appears in the
secret 2013 budget for the intelligence community, key parts of which
were published last year from the Snowden archive.
The document does not name any foreign companies or products, and
gives no indication of the number or scale of the agencyâs ties to
them. Previous disclosures from the Snowden archive have exposed the
agencyâs close relationships with foreign intelligence agencies, but
there has been relatively little revealed about the agency gaining the
help of foreign companies.
The description of Sentry Hawk, which involves attacks on computer
networks, also indicates close ties with foreign as well as American
companies. The document states that the NSA âworks with U.S. and
foreign commercial entitiesâ¦in the conduct of CNE [Computer Network
Exploitation].â Although previous stories from the Snowden archive
revealed a wide range of NSA attacks on computer networks, it has been
unclear whether those attacks were conducted with the help of
âcommercial entitiesââespecially foreign ones. The document does not
provide the names of any of these entities or the types of operations.
Green, the cryptography professor, said âitâs a big dealâ if the NSA
is working with foreign companies on a greater scale than currently
understood. Until now, he noted, disclosures about the agencyâs
corporate relationships have focused on American companies. Those
revelations have harmed their credibility, nudging customers to
foreign alternatives that were thought to be untouched by the NSA. If
foreign companies are also cooperating with the NSA and modifying
their products, the options for purchasing truly secure
telecommunications hardware are more limited than previously thought.
The briefing sheet does not say whether foreign governments are aware
that the NSA may be working with their own companies. If they are not
aware, says William Binney, a former NSA crypto-mathematician turned
whistleblower, it would mean the NSA is cutting deals behind the backs
of friendly and perhaps not-so-friendly governments.
âThe idea of having foreign corporations involved without any hint of
any foreign government involved is significant,â he said. âIt will be
an alert to all governments to go check with their companies. Bring
them into parliament and put them under oath.â
The description of Sentry Raven, which focuses on encryption, provides
additional confirmation that American companies have helped the NSA by
secretly weakening encryption products to make them vulnerable to the
agency. The briefing sheet states the NSA âworks with specific U.S.
commercial entitiesâ¦to modify U.S manufactured encryption systems to
make them exploitable for SIGINT.â It doesnât name the commercial
entities or the encryption tools they modified, but it appears to
encompass a type of activity that Reuters revealed last yearâthat the
NSA paid $10 million to the security firm RSA to use a weak random
number generator in one of its encryption programs.
The avalanche of NSA disclosures since the Snowden leaks began in 2013
has shattered whatever confidence technologists once had about their
networks. When asked for comment on the latest documents, Prince, the
CEO of CloudFlare, began his response by saying, âWeâre hyper-paranoid
about everything.â

@_subject: The NSA and Me - by James Bamford 
"More than three decades later, the NSA, like a mom-and-pop operation
that has exploded into a global industry, now employs sweeping powers
of surveillance that Frank Church could scarcely have imagined in the
days of wired phones and clunky typewriters. At the same time, the
Senate intelligence committee he once chaired has done an about face,
protecting the agencies from the public rather than the public from
the agencies..."
The NSA and Me - by James Bamford
The tone of the answering machine message was routine, like a reminder
for a dental appointment. But there was also an undercurrent of
urgency. âPlease call me back,â the voice said. âItâs important.â
What worried me was who was calling: a senior attorney with the
Justice Departmentâs secretive Office of Intelligence Policy and
Review. By the time I hung up the payphone at a little coffee shop in
Cambridge, Mass., and wandered back to my table, strewn with yellow
legal pads and dog-eared documents, I had guessed what he was after:
my copy of the Justice Departmentâs top-secret criminal file on the
National Security Agency. Only two copies of the original were ever
made. Now I had to find a way to get it out of the countryâfast.
It was July 8, 1981, a broiling Wednesday in Harvard Square, and I was
in a quiet corner of the Algiers Coffee House on Brattle Street. A
cool, souk-like basement room, with the piney aroma of frankincense,
it made for a perfect hideout to sort through documents, jot down
notes, and pore over stacks of newspapers while sipping bottomless
cups of Arabic coffee and espresso the color of dark chocolate.
For several years I had been working on my first book, The Puzzle
Palace, which provided the first in-depth look at the National
Security Agency. The deeper I dug, the more troubled I became. Not
only did the classified file from the Justice Department accuse the
NSA of systematically breaking the law by eavesdropping on American
citizens, it concluded that it was impossible to prosecute those
running the agency because of the enormous secrecy that enveloped it.
Worse, the file made clear that the NSA itself was effectively beyond
the lawâallowed to bypass statutes passed by Congress and follow its
own super-classified charter, what the agency called a âtop-secret
birth certificateâ drawn up by the White House decades earlier.
Knowing the potential for such an unregulated agency to go rogue, I
went on to write two more books about the NSA, Body of Secrets, in
2001, and The Shadow Factory, in 2008. My goal was to draw attention
to the dangers the agency posed if it is not closely watched and
controlledâdangers that would be laid bare in stark detail by Edward
Snowden years later.
âYou Want to Hear Something Interesting?â
The idea of writing a book about the NSA had occurred to me several
years earlier. During the war in Vietnam, I spent three years in the
Navy at Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Hawaii. It was a nice venue a
long way from the bloody battlefields, where the only dangers were
rogue surfboards on Waikiki Beach and bar fights on Hotel Street.
Assigned to an NSA unit, I experienced the war vicariously: One of my
jobs every morning was reading a foot-high stack of overnight messages
from the war zone, mostly NSA reports classified top secret and
higher, and passing them on to whichever project officer had
responsibility to simply read or take action.
Later, in law school and running low on cash, I decided to rejoin the
Naval Reserve to help pay for living expenses. The Navy was very
accommodating, allowing me to pick not only when I wanted to do my two
weeks of active duty, but also where. So I decided to request two
weeks in October 1974, which coincided with a school break. And for
location I chose Puerto Ricoâa nice warm island far from chilly
Boston. Although I had NSA clearances, I had never worked at an actual
NSA intercept site. Nevertheless, the Navy decided to send me down to
Sabana Seca, one of the agencyâs key listening posts, which focused on
Cuba, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
Like most listening posts at the time, Sabana Seca consisted of a
gigantic circular antenna about half a mile wide and a hundred or so
feet high, an odd structure that closely resembled its nicknameâthe
âelephant cage.â Known as a Wullenweber antenna, it was used not only
to intercept communications, but also to assist in triangulating where
the transmissions were coming from. At the center of the elephant cage
was the operations building, a windowless, two-story, gray cement
Rubikâs cube. Inside were tall racks of receivers with blinking
lights, big black dials, oval-shaped gauges, and silver toggle
switches facing rows of earphone-clad men and women in blue Navy-issue
Unfamiliar with the technology and unable to speak more than
rudimentary Spanish, I spent my two weeks pushing a few papers and
staying out of the way, hoping to avoid work as much as possible. But
one day an intercept operator with whom I had downed a few beers at
the base club the night before spotted me and waved me over. âYou want
to hear something interesting?â he said as he took off his earphones.
I thanked him but explained I didnât speak Spanish. âNo, no,â he said,
âItâs English.â So I put on the earphones and listened in to what
appeared to be several Americans carrying on a conversation. I only
heard a few snippets, not enough to get a sense of the topic, but I
was surprised. âInteresting,â I said. âYou get many Americans
speaking?â He said they did on certain channels they were assigned to
target. I thanked him, said something about getting another beer later
that night, and wandered off to watch some other intercept operators
pulling in long reams of blue teletype paper covered in Spanish.
It was only when I was back in Boston, where I had a part-time job as
a student prosecutor with the Suffolk County district attorneyâs
office, that the conversation came back to me. I was working on a case
in which the topic of a wiretap came up, and there was a long
discussion about procedures for a warrant. I suddenly wondered what
legal authority the intercept operators at Sabana Seca had to target
American conversations. I did a little research in the law library,
but could find nothing that gave the military any powers for
warrantless eavesdropping on Americans.
A few weeks later, just before Christmas, The New York Times broke a
series of stories by Seymour Hersh outlining Operation Chaos, the
program by which the FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies
targeted U.S. citizens involved in anti-war protests. The articles
caused widespread public outrage, followed by a high-profile
congressional investigation led by Senator Frank Church. I felt
certain that whatever it was I sawâand heardâin Sabana Seca would soon
be discovered.
But during the summer of 1975, as reports began leaking out from the
Church Committee, I was surprised to learn that the NSA was claiming
that it had shut down all of its questionable operations a year and a
half earlier. Surprised because I knew the eavesdropping on Americans
had continued at least into the prior fall, and may have still been
going on. After thinking for a day or so about the potential
consequences of blowing the whistle on the NSAâI was still in the
Naval Reserve, still attending drills one weekend a month, and still
sworn to secrecy with an active NSA clearanceâI nevertheless decided
to call the Church Committee.
It was July 1, and at first the staffer with whom I spoke sounded
skepticalâsomeone calling out of the blue and accusing the NSA of
lying. But after I mentioned my work at Sabana Seca, he asked how soon
I could come down to Washington to testify. At 8:40 the next morning,
I boarded American Airlines Flight 605 and took seat 13Aâan unlucky
number, I thought. It would be the first of numerous trips. The
committee agreed to keep my name confidential and allowed me to
testify in executive session in Sen. Churchâs private office. Soon
after, committee staffers flew down to Sabana Seca for a surprise
inspection. Surprise, indeed. They were shocked to discover the
program had never been shut down, despite the NSAâs claims.
âJust Because the Information Has Been Published Doesnât Mean it
Should No Longer Be Classifiedâ
The discovery that the NSA had been lying to the Church Committee
shocked me. But it also gave me the idea to write the first book about
the agency. As more and more revelations came out about the NSAâs
widespread, illegal eavesdropping activities, I found myself filled
with questions. Where did the agency come from? What did it do? How
did it operate? Who was watching it? In the summer of 1979, after a
year of research, I submitted a proposal to Houghton Mifflin for The
Puzzle Palace, and within a few months was awarded a book contract. It
was the start of wild ride, taking on an agency so secret that even
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley told me, at the time, that he had never
heard of it.
I soon learned that there was one major advantage to being first: The
NSA had grown so confident that no one would ever dare to write about
it that it had let its guard down. I would occasionally drive up to
the agency, park in the executive parking lot, walk in the front door
to the lobby, get some coffee and have a seat. All around me were
employees from the CIA and foreign intelligence agencies, all waiting
to be processed for their NSA visitorâs badge. As I read my paper and
sipped my coffee, I quietly listened to them chat away about signals
intelligence operations, new listening posts, cooperative agreements,
and a host of other topics. No one ever asked who I was or why I was
there. In the parking lot, I copied the license plate numbers of the
dozen cars parked closest to the front entrance, then ran the numbers
at the registry of motor vehicles. The result was a Whoâs Who of the
NSAâs leadership, as well as the liaison officers from Americaâs
so-called Five Eyes surveillance partners: England, Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand.
By the summer of 1981, I had also won several significant legal
battles with the agency. As a result of an out-of-court settlement,
the NSA was forced to give me a tour of the agency, detail the entire
structure of its internal organization to me, and provide me
interviews with senior officials. Even though the agency was virtually
immune from the Freedom of Information Act, I managed to find a
loophole that allowed me access to more than 6,000 pages of internal
documents. I even worked out an agreement whereby they would provide
me with an office in the agency for a week to go through the 6,000
pages. But then the NSA got its revengeâwhen they handed me the 6,000
pages, they were all out of order, as if they had been shuffled like a
new deck of cards. Nothing in the Freedom of Information Act, it turns
out, requires collation. The hostility became so intense that the
director, Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, accused me of using a âhostage
approachâ in my battle to force the agency to give me documents and
But the NSA knew nothing about one of my biggest finds, which took
place on the campus of the Virginia Military Institute. Nicknamed âthe
West Point of the South,â VMI housed the papers of William F.
Friedman, a founder of both the NSA and of American cryptology. The
NSAâs own auditorium is named after him. Yet Friedman had soured on
the agency by the time he retired, and deliberately left his papers to
a research library at VMI to get them as far away from the NSA as
After Friedmanâs death, and without his permission, agency officials
traveled to the library, pulled out hundreds of his personal letters,
and ordered them locked away in a secure vault. When I discovered what
the NSA had done, I persuaded the libraryâs archivist to give me
access to the letters, all of which were unclassified. Many were
embarrassingly critical of the agency, describing its enormous
paranoia and obsession with secrecy. Others contained clues to a
secret trips that Friedman had made to Switzerland, where he helped
the agency gain backdoor access into encryption systems that a Swiss
company was selling to foreign countries.
I also discovered that a former NSA director, Lt. Gen. Marshall
Carter, had left his papers â including reams of unclassified
documents from his NSA office â to the same research library at VMI.
They included personal, handwritten correspondence from Carterâs
British counterpart about listening posts, cooperative agreements, and
other sensitive topics. Later, Carter gave me a long and detailed
interview about the NSA. The agency knew nothing about either the
documents or the interview.
Following the publication of my book, the NSA raided the research
library, stamped many of the Friedman documents secret, and ordered
them put back into the vault. âJust because information has been
published,â NSA director Lincoln Faurer explained to The New York
Times, âdoesnât mean it should no longer be classified.â Faurer also
flew to Colorado, where Gen. Carter was living in retirement, met with
him at the NSA listening post at Buckley Air Force Base, and
threatened him with prosecution if he ever gave another interview or
allowed anyone else access to his papers.
âPrima Facie Questions of Criminalityâ
But my biggest battle with the NSA came before my book was even
published. Without the agencyâs knowledge, I had obtained the criminal
file that the Justice Department had opened on the NSA. Marked as Top
Secret, the file was so sensitive that only two original copies
existed. Never before or since has an entire agency been the subject
of a criminal investigation. Senior officials at the NSA were even
read their Miranda rights.
The secret investigation grew out of the final report by the
Rockefeller Commission, a panel that had been set up by President
Gerald Ford to parallel the Church Committee. Issued on June 6, 1975,
the report noted that both the NSA and CIA had engaged in questionable
and possibly illegal electronic surveillance. As a result, Attorney
General Edward Levi established a secret internal task force to look
into the potential for criminal prosecution. Focusing particularly on
NSA, the task force probed more deeply into domestic eavesdropping
than any part of the executive branch had ever done before.
I had heard rumors from several sources about such a probe, so I
thought it would be worth requesting a copy of the file under FOIA.
Nevertheless, I was surprised when the documents, with relatively few
redactions, turned up at my door 10 months later. They included a
lengthy, detailed âReport on Inquiry into CIA-Related Surveillance
Activitiesâ that laid out the investigation in stark detail, as well
as a shorter draft âprosecutive summaryâ evaluating the potential for
criminal prosecution. I was shocked that the Justice Department had
released them to me without notifying the NSA. An official at Justice
later told me that it was standard procedure not to notify the object
of a criminal investigation (think John Gotti) once it is completed
and requested under FOIA.
It turned out that just as with its investigations into organized
crime, the Justice Department had received little cooperation from the
potential criminal defendant â in this case, the NSA. Noting that the
attitude of agency officials âranged from circumspection to wariness,â
the file made clear that the NSA had stonewalled investigators at
every step. âOne typically had to ask the right question to elicit the
right answer or document,â an attorney for the Justice Department
reported. âIt is likely, therefore, that we had insufficient
information on occasion to frame the âmagicâ question.â
But the agencyâs obstructionism didnât prevent the Justice Department
from finding evidence of serious wrongdoing. The draft prosecutive
summary of the Justice Departmentâs investigative task force, dated
March 4, 1977, and classified top secret detailed 23 categories of
questionable eavesdropping operations. Five of the illegal activities
were immune from prosecution because the statute of limitations had
passed, and seven were found to âclearly possess no prosecutive
potential.â The rest, however, were fair game for criminal
prosecution. Discussing the agencyâs Operation Minaret, for example,
the full report concluded: âThis electronic surveillance activity
presents prima facie questions of criminality and is well within the
limitations period.â
The prosecutive summary had been sent to Attorney General Benjamin
Civiletti for further action. But any attempt to prosecute top
officials of Americaâs most secret agency, the file warned, would
almost certainly be met by finger-pointing and scapegoating. âThere is
likely to be much âbuck-passingâ from subordinate to superior, agency
to agency, agency to board or committee, board or committee to the
President, and from the living to the dead,â the report cautioned.
In addition, calling the crimes âan international cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre
involving fundamental constitutional rights of United States
citizens,â the task force pointed to the likelihood that the NSA would
put political pressure on anyone who dared to testify against it.
Whatâs more, the report added, defense attorneys for senior NSA
officials would likely subpoena âevery tenuously involved government
official and former officialâ to establish that the illegal operations
had been authorized from on high. âWhile the high office of
prospective defense witnesses should not enter into the prosecutive
decision,â the report noted, âthe confusion, obfuscation, and surprise
testimony which might result cannot be ignored.â
The reportâs prosecutive summary also pointed to the NSAâs top-secret
âcharterâ issued by the Executive Branch, which exempts the agency
from legal restraints placed on the rest of the government. âOrders,
directives, policies, or recommendations of any authority of the
Executive branch relating to the collection . . . of intelligence,â
the charter reads, âshall not be applicable to Communications
Intelligence activities, unless specifically so stated.â This
so-called âbirth certificate,â the Justice Department report
concluded, meant the NSA did not have to follow any restrictions
placed on electronic surveillance âunless it was expressly directed to
do so.â In short, the report asked, how can you prosecute an agency
that is above the law?
If the first shock to top officials at the NSA was the discovery that
they were being investigated as potential criminals, the second shock
was that I had a copy of the top secret file on the investigation.
When the NSA discovered that the file was in my possession, director
Bobby Inman wrote to the attorney general informing him that the
documents contained classified information and should never have been
handed over to me. But Civiletti, apparently believing that the file
had been properly reviewed and declassified, ignored Inmanâs protest.
Then, on January 20, 1981, Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. At the
Justice Department, Civiletti was replaced by a new attorney general
with a much more accommodating attitude when it came to the NSA:
William French Smith.
A few months later, while I was working on a chapter of my book that
dealt with the Five Eyes partnership, I sent a letter to George Gapp,
the senior liaison officer from GCHQ, the NSAâs British counterpart.
In the letter, I noted that documents released to me by the Justice
Department implicated his agency in Operation Minaret, the illegal NSA
program directed against American citizens. I asked whether he knew of
GCHQâs involvement in the operation and whether the agency was
currently engaged in any similar activities in the United States.
The letter apparently set off a firestorm, both at the NSA and GCHQ.
Lt. Gen. Faurer, who had replaced Inman as director, sent a letter to
the new attorney general again pointing out that the documents in my
possession contained top-secret material. Considering that they
accused his agency of being a criminal enterprise, they were also
embarrassing to the NSA, and potentially explosive. The decision was
made to try to get them back from me before the publication of my
Thus the answering machine message I heard on that steamy day in
Cambridge, while I was quietly working away at a back table in the
Algiers Coffee House. The call was from Gerald Schroeder, a senior
attorney with the Justice Department. When I called him back, he asked
whether we could meet in Washington to discuss the file that had been
released to me by his own department. The Reagan Justice Department,
it seemed, now wanted to reverse the decision of the Carter Justice
Department and get the documents back.
Long before the arrival of the internet, and the ability to transfer
documents at the tap of a finger, I was very concerned about what the
agency might do to retrieve the physical copy of the file in my
possession. Years before, when David Kahn had written his monumental
history of cryptology, the agency had considered placing him under
surveillance and conducting a âsurreptitious entryâ into his Long
Island home to steal the manuscript prior to publication. Decades
earlier, after Herbert Yardley wrote about the Black Chamber, the
predecessor to NSA, the Justice Department actually did steal the
manuscript for his second book, preventing it from ever being
My first thought was to quickly make a duplicate of the file and get
the copy out of the country. That would protect the documents not only
from theft, but also from any court order prohibiting me from
revealing their contents. With a copy beyond the jurisdiction of U.S.
courts, a foreign newspaper could always publish the documents.
I called a close friend who worked for the Insight Team, the
investigative unit of Londonâs Sunday Times. She agreed to help. It
turned out that an American journalist she knew was flying from Boston
to London that night, and she quickly arranged for him to take the
documents with him and give them to her to hide.
That night I met the journalist on a dark Boston street corner and
passed him a package, with the understanding that I was not to tell
him was it contained. He wanted as little information as possible, in
case he was questioned later. Early the next morning, my friend at the
Sunday Times called from London with a code indicating that all was
well and that the documents were in a secure place.
With the documents safely beyond the reach of the Justice Department,
I next turned to my next problem â finding an attorney to represent
me. With the advance on my book totaling $7,500, spread over three
years, I was in no position to seek out a white-shoe law firm on
Beacon Hill. Instead, I called the ACLUâs Center for National Security
Studies and explained my problem. They immediately put me in touch
with Mark Lynch, a staff attorney at the center who had considerable
experience going up against intelligence agencies, including the NSA.
Lynch agreed to represent me.
On July 23, two weeks after I had received the phone call at the
coffee shop, Lynch and I met with Schroeder for an hour and a half in
the conference room of the center, a cluster of rooms in the stately
Stewart Mott house on Capitol Hill. Schroeder began by insisting that
the two documents had been released to me âby mistake.â The NSA and
the CIA had determined that they contained information that was still
classified, he said, and the Justice Department would like me to
return them.
I politely informed Schroeder that the documents had been in my
possession for more than two years, that material from them was
already incorporated into my manuscript, and that the Carter
administration had spent 10 months reviewing them before releasing the
documents to me. There had been no mistake. In addition, because the
documents raised questions about criminal activities by the NSA and
CIA, I felt it was important for the public to be informed. In the
end, we agreed to another meeting â but this time I insisted that
since I had traveled to Washington for the first meeting, they would
come to Boston for the next one.
The second meeting took place on August 14, in the editorial
conference room of my publisher, Houghton Mifflin, on Beacon Hill.
This time, the government dispensed with any attempt at politeness.
Accompanying Schroeder were the NSAâs general counsel, Daniel
Schwartz, and the agencyâs director of policy, Eugene Yeates. They
immediately began by interrogating me. How many copies of the document
I had made? Whom I had given them to? Where were the documents now
located? I responded that none of those questions were on the agenda;
since my attorney could not be present, we had agreed in advance that
the meeting was simply to allow them to explain the governmentâs
position. Any questions, I said, would have to go through Mark Lynch.
I pointed to the phone.
After placing a call to Lynch, Schroeder brought up the possibility of
using the espionage statue to force me to return the documents. Lynch
immediately asked to speak with me privately.
Once the three officials left the room, Lynch expressed worry over the
way the meeting was going. The officials could have a subpoena or a
restraining order or a warrant for my arrest in their pocket, he said.
He advised me to put down the receiver, call Schroeder to the phone,
leave the room â and keep walking. To this day, I still have no idea
how long the three officials waited for me to return before finding
their way out of the publishing house and back to Washington.
The fight quickly escalated. On September 24, after we informed
Schroeder that I was going to use the documents in my book and that
all further discussions would be pointless, I received a registered
letter. âYou are currently in possession of classified information
that requires protection against unauthorized disclosure,â Schroeder
wrote. âUnder the circumstances, I have no choice but to demand that
you return the two documents . . . Of course, you will have a
continuing obligation not to publish or communicate the information.â
To emphasize the point, on November 27 the Justice Department sent my
attorney a letter stating that âthere should be no misunderstanding of
the Governmentâs position that Mr. Bamford holds information that is
currently and properly classifiedâ and that failure to return the
documents could force federal prosecutors to resort to an unnamed
âpost-publication judicial remedy.â
Despite the threats, I refused to alter my manuscript or return the
documents. Instead, we argued that according to Executive Order 12065,
âclassification may not be restored to documents already declassified
and released to the publicâ under the Freedom of Information Act. That
prompted the drama to move all the way up to the White House. On April
2, 1982, President Reagan signed a new executive order on secrecy that
overturned the earlier one and granted him the authority to
âreclassify information previously declassified and disclosed.â
We responded by citing the legal principal of ex post facto, arguing
that even if the new executive order was legal, Reagan could not
retroactively enforce it against me. The Puzzle Palace was published
on schedule, in September 1982, with no deletions or alterations to
the text. And ever since then, the NSAâs criminal file â still
officially top secret, according to the NSA â has remained on my
Wrongdoing Masquerading as Patriotism
More than three decades later, the NSA, like a mom-and-pop operation
that has exploded into a global industry, now employs sweeping powers
of surveillance that Frank Church could scarcely have imagined in the
days of wired phones and clunky typewriters. At the same time, the
Senate intelligence committee he once chaired has done an about face,
protecting the agencies from the public rather than the public from
the agencies.
It is a dangerous combination â one the Church Committee warned of
long ago. âThe potential for abuse is awesome,â the committee
observed, especially when âchecks and balances designed â¦ to assure
accountability have not been applied.â As the committee presciently
noted in its report, âIntelligence collection programs naturally
generate ever-increasing demands for new data.â
For proof, one need only look at the NSAâs ever-expanding array of
surveillance techniques. The agencyâs metadata collection program now
targets everyone in the country old enough to hold a phone. The
gargantuan data storage facility it has built in Utah may eventually
hold zettabytes (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes) of information.
And the massive supercomputer that the NSA is secretly building in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, will search through it all at exaflop
(1,000,000,000,000,000,000 operations per second) speeds.
Without adequate oversight, or penalties for abuse, the only
protection that citizens have comes not from Congress or the courts,
but from whistleblowers. As one myself, albeit in the most minor
capacity, I understand what motivates someone to expose wrongdoing
masquerading as patriotism. There is no graduate school for
whistleblowing and no handbook for whistleblowers. Itâs an imperfect
science, and whistleblowers learn from the mistakes of their
predecessors. Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, Tom Drake, Bill Binney
and Kirk Wiebe all came from different backgrounds and worked in
different fields. None joined the intelligence community to become a
whistleblower, but each was driven by unchecked government abuse to
tell the public what they knew to be true.
The solution is not to jail the whistleblowers, or to question the
patriotism of those who tell their stories, but to do what Attorney
General Edward Levi courageously attempted to do more than a third of
a century ago â to have the criminal division of the Justice
Department conduct a thorough investigation, and then to prosecute any
member of the intelligence community who has broken the law, whether
by illegally spying on Americans or by lying to Congress.
I would be happy to lend my copy of the NSAâs criminal file to
Attorney General Eric Holder, if he would like to see how to begin. Or
he can read it here.

a simplistic "shellshock worse than heartbleed" is
mis-characterization of the situation.
first, this presents a vulnerability without context, by itself. in
the real world, we care about vulnerability with respect to
exploitation. usually many vulnerabilities are leveraged together in
exploitation of notoriety.
in the sense of best practice and conservative security posture,
heartbleed could be worse by far. a strongly keyed, defense in depth
surreptitiously bypassed via bleeding. e.g. bleed UDP DTLS VPN to
access internal network, bleed intranet HTTPS for admin credentials to
critical infrastructure services.
the ability to send things to a bash shell, even restricted shell,
even constrained behind  application layers, was always seen as bad
practice for security conscious configurations - insiders get shell,
not untrusted inputs.
last but not least, this is all bullshit speculation; risk is a
perspective and shellshock or heartbleed is better or worse depending
on what you're looking at.

Wind River Systems exported its software to China, Hong Kong, Russia,
Israel, South Africa, and South Korea. BIS [Bureau of Industry and
Security] significantly mitigated what would have been a much larger
fine because the company voluntarily disclosed the violations.
We believe this to be the first penalty BIS has ever issued for the
unlicensed export of encryption software that did not also involve
comprehensively sanctioned countries (e.g., Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Sudan or Syria). This suggests a fundamental change in BISâs treatment
of violations of the encryption regulations.
Historically, BIS has resolved voluntarily disclosed violations of the
encryption regulations with a warning letter but no material
consequence, and has shown itself unlikely to pursue such violations
that were not disclosed. This fine dramatically increases the
compliance stakes for software companies â a message that BIS seemed
intent upon making in its announcement.
fuck BIS!

"Keeping Secrets"
Four decades ago, university researchers figured out the key to
computer privacy, sparking a battle with the National Security Agency
that continues today.
  BY HENRY CORRIGAN-GIBBS
WHAT IF your research could help solve a looming national problem, but
government officials thought publishing it would be tantamount to
treason? A Stanford professor and his graduate students found
themselves in that situation 37 years ago, when their visionary work
on computer privacy issues ran afoul of the National Security Agency.
At the time, knowledge of how to encrypt and decrypt information was
the domain of government; the NSA feared that making the secrets of
cryptography public would severely hamper intelligence operations. But
as the researchers saw it, societyâs growing dependence on computers
meant that the private sector would also need effective measures to
safeguard information. Both sidesâ concerns proved prescient; their
conflict foreshadowed what would become a universal tug-of-war between
privacy-conscious technologists and security-conscious government
A Controversial Symposium
The International Symposium on Information Theory is not known for its
racy content or politically charged presentations, but the session at
Cornell University on October 10, 1977, was a special case. In
addition to talks with titles like âDistribution-Free Inequalities for
the Deleted and Holdout Error Estimates,â the conference featured the
work of a group from Stanford that had drawn the ire of the National
Security Agency and the attention of the national press. The
researchers in question were Martin Hellman, then an associate
professor of electrical engineering, and his students Steve Pohlig, MS
â75, PhD â78, and Ralph Merkle, PhD â79.
A year earlier, Hellman had published âNew Directions in Cryptographyâ
with his student Whitfield Diffie, Gr. â78. The paper introduced the
principles that now form the basis for all modern cryptography, and
its publication rightfully caused a stir among electrical engineers
and computer scientists. As Hellman recalled in a 2004 oral history,
the nonmilitary communityâs reaction to the paper was âecstatic.â In
contrast, the âNSA was apoplectic.â
The fact that Hellman and his students were challenging the U.S.
governmentâs longstanding domestic monopoly on cryptography deeply
annoyed many in the intelligence community. The NSA acknowledged that
Diffie and Hellman had come up with their ideas without access to
classified materials. Even so, in the words of an internal NSA history
declassified in 2009 and now held in the Stanford Archives, âNSA
regarded the [Diffie-Hellman] technique as classified. Now it was out
in the open.â
The tension between Hellman and the NSA only worsened in the months
leading up to the 1977 symposium. In July, someone named J. A. Meyer
sent a shrill letter to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers, which had published Hellmanâs papers and was holding the
conference. It began:
    I have noticed in the past months that various IEEE Groups have
been publishing and exporting technical articles on encryption and
cryptologyâââa technical field which is covered by Federal
Regulations, viz: ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22
CFR 121â128).
Meyerâs letter asserted that the IEEE and the authors of the relevant
papers might be subject to prosecution under federal laws prohibiting
arms trafficking, communication of atomic secrets and disclosure of
classified information.
Without naming Hellman or his co-authors, Meyer specified the issues
of IEEEâs Transactions on Information Theory journal and Computer
magazine in which Hellmanâs articles appeared. Meyer concluded
ominously that âthese modern weapons technologies, uncontrollably
disseminated, could have more than academic effect.â
Meyerâs letter alarmed many in the academic community and drew
coverage by Science and the New York Times for two main reasons.
First, the letter suggested that merely publishing a scientific paper
on cryptography would be the legal equivalent of exporting nuclear
weapons to a foreign country. If Meyerâs interpretation of the law was
correct, it seemed to place severe restrictions on researchersâ
freedom to publish. Second, Deborah Shapley and Gina Kolata of Science
magazine discovered that Meyer was an NSA employee.
As soon as Hellman received a copy of the letter, he recognized that
continuing to publish might put him and his students in legal
jeopardy, so he sought advice from Stanford University counsel John
In his memo to Schwartz, Hellman made a lucid case for the value of
public-domain cryptography research. Astutely, Hellman first
acknowledged that the U.S. governmentâs tight control over
cryptographic techniques proved enormously useful in World War II:
Allied forces used confidential cryptographic discoveries to improve
their own encryption systems while denying those same cryptographic
benefits to Axis powers. Even so, Hellman argued that circumstances
had changed.
    [T]here is a commercial need today that did not exist in the
1940âs. The growing use of automated information processing equipment
poses a real economic and privacy threat. Although it is a remote
possibility, the danger of initially inadvertent police state type
surveillance through computerization must be considered. From that
point of view, inadequate commercial cryptography (which our
publications are trying to avoid) poses an internal national security
In the memo, Hellman described how his earlier attempts to prevent
âstepping on [the] toesâ of the NSA failed when the agencyâs staffers
would not even disclose which areas of cryptography research Hellman
should avoid.
Responding to Hellman a few days later, Schwartz opined that
publishing cryptography research would not in itself violate federal
law. His findings had a strong legal basis: Two regulations governed
classified information in the United States at the timeâââan executive
order and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954âââand neither seemed to
prevent the publication of unclassified research on cryptography.

monopoly on cryptography. (Photo by Chuck Painter/Stanford News
There was only one other likely legal tool that the federal government
could use to prevent the Stanford group from disseminating their work:
the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, which regulated the export of
military equipment. Under a generous interpretation of the law, giving
a public presentation on cryptographic algorithms could constitute
âexportâ of arms. It was not clear, however, that a prosecution under
this act would stand up to a legal challenge on First Amendment
Evaluating these laws together, Schwartz concluded that Hellman and
his students could legally continue to publish. At the same time,
Schwartz noted wryly, âat least one contrary view [of the law] existsâ
ââthat of Joseph A. Meyer. Hellman later recalled Schwartzâs
less-than-comforting informal advice: âIf you are prosecuted, Stanford
will defend you. But if youâre found guilty, we canât pay your fine
and we canât go to jail for you.â
The Cornell symposium was to begin three days after Schwartz offered
his legal opinion; Hellman, Merkle and Pohlig had to quickly decide
whether to proceed with their presentations in spite of the threat of
prosecution, fines and jail time. Graduate students typically present
their own research at academic conferences, but according to Hellman,
Schwartz recommended against it in this case. Since the students were
not employees of Stanford, it might be more difficult for the
university to justify paying their legal bills. Schwartz also reasoned
that dealing with a lengthy court case would be harder for a young PhD
student than for a tenured faculty member. Hellman left the decision
up to the students.
According to Hellman, Merkle and Pohlig at first said, âWe need to
give the papers, the hell with this.â After speaking with their
families, though, the students agreed to let Hellman present on their
In the end, the symposium took place without incident. Merkle and
Pohlig stood on stage while Hellman gave the presentation. The fact
that the conference went ahead as planned, Science observed, âleft
little doubt that the work [in cryptography] has been widely
circulated.â That a group of nongovernmental researchers could
publicly discuss cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms signaled the
end of the U.S. governmentâs domestic control of information on
The View from Fort Meade
Vice Adm. Bobby Ray Inman took over as director of the NSA in the
summer of 1977. Inman was an experienced naval intelligence officer
with allies in both political parties. If his qualifications for the
job were good, his timing was not. He had barely warmed his desk chair
when he was thrust into the center of what he recently described as âa
huge media uproarâ over the J. A. Meyer letterâââwritten the very
first day of Inmanâs tenure.
Although Inman was concerned about the impact that publication of
these new cryptographic techniques would have on the NSAâs foreign
eavesdropping capabilities, he was also puzzled. As he explained, the
primary consumers of cryptographic equipment in the 1970s were
governments. Apart from that, âthe only other people early on . . .
who were buying encryption to use were the drug dealers.â Since the
NSA already had âincredibly able people working on building the
systems to be used by the U.S. governmentâ and the NSA had no interest
in protecting the communications of drug dealers, Inman wanted to find
out why these young researchers were so focused on cryptography.
In the tradition of intelligence professionals, Inman set out to
gather some information for himself. He went to California to meet
with faculty members and industry leaders at Berkeley, Stanford and
elsewhere. Inman quickly discovered that the researchers at Stanford
were designing cryptographic systems to solve an emerging problem that
was not yet on the NSAâs radar: securing the growing number of
commercial computer systems, which were subject to attack or
compromise. The researchersâ position, Inman said, was that âthereâs a
whole new world emerging out there where thereâs going to need to be
cryptography, and itâs not going to be provided by the government.â
Martin Hellman recently recounted their conversation in similar terms:
âI was working on cryptography from an unclassified point of view
because I could seeâââeven in the mid-â70sâââthe growing marriage of
computers and communication and the need therefore for unclassified
knowledge of cryptography.â Inman realized that the California
academics saw strong public cryptographic systems as a crucial piece
of a functioning technological environment.
Still, Inman was not excited about the prospect of high-grade
encryption systems being available for purchase, especially abroad.
âWe were worried that foreign countries would pick up and use
cryptography that would make it exceedingly hard to decrypt and read
their traffic.â
The level of public excitement surrounding the recent cryptography
work made growth in the field of unclassified cryptography almost
inevitable. In August 1977, Scientific American had published a
description of the new RSA cryptosystem devised by Ron Rivest, Adi
Shamir and Leonard Adleman of MIT. According to Steven Levyâs 2001
book Crypto, the researchers offered a copy of a technical report
describing the scheme to anyone who would send a self-addressed
stamped envelope to MIT. The authors received 7,000 requests.
To reckon with the growing threat of unclassified cryptography, Inman
convened an internal NSA panel for advice. As recounted in the
declassified NSA history, the panel gave Inman three stark choices for
how to control the publication of cryptography research:
(a) Do nothing
(b) Seek new legislation to impose additional government controls
(c) Try non-legislative means such as voluntary commercial and
academic compliance.
The panel concluded that the damage was already so serious that
something needed to be done.
NSA documents and Hellmanâs recollection both suggest that Inman first
tried to get a law drafted to restrict cryptographic research, along
the lines of the Atomic Energy Act. For political reasons, the NSA
history says, Inmanâs proposed bill was âdead on arrival.â
âCongress [wanted to] unshackle U.S. commerce from any sort of
Pentagon-imposed restriction on trade,â the history ruefully recounts,
and the Carter administration âwanted to loosen Pentagon control of
anything, especially anything that might affect individual rights and
academic freedom.â
Even if Inman could get a bill through Congress, Hellman said, the
First Amendment would make it difficult to prevent researchers from
speaking publicly about their work. If they didnât publish their
papers, âtheyâll give 100 talks before they submit it for
As a sort of last-ditch effort at compromise, Inman organized a
voluntary system of prepublication review for cryptography research
papers. A number of other scientific journals have attempted a similar
system in recent years. âThatâs really the best anyone has been able
to come up with,â said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American
Scientists, an expert on government secrecy.
The review process was used for a decade, but Inman recalled that it
eventually âfell apartâ because of âthe explosion of . . . usesâ for
cryptography. As the world underwent a digital revolution, there was
an accompanying ârevolution in cryptography,â just as Diffie and
Hellman had predicted in 1976.
It is tempting to view the outcome of the conflict between the
Stanford researchers and the NSA as an unequivocal victory for freedom
of speech and the beginning of the democratization of the tools of
cryptography. There is a grain of truth in this characterization, but
it misses the larger effect the run-in had on the academic
cryptography community and on the NSA.
Hellman and other academic researchers realized they could win the
debate, as long as it took place in public. Newspapers and scientific
journals found it much easier to sympathize with a group of quirky and
passionate academics than with a shadowy and stern-faced intelligence
agency. The issue of First Amendment rights, Hellman recalled in 2004,
also gave the press and the researchers a common cause. âWith the
freedom of publication issue, the press was all on our side. There
were editorials in the New York Times and a number of other
publications. Science, I remember, had covered our work and was very
From the other side, NSA officials realized they would have a
difficult time getting public support to suppress publication of what
they considered dangerous research results. They turned instead to two
aspects of nongovernmental cryptography over which they had near-total
control: research funding and national standards.
As of 2012, the federal government provided 60 percent of U.S.
academic research and development funding. By choosing which projects
to fund, grant-giving government agencies influence what research
takes place.
Even before the 1977 Symposium on Information Theory, the NSA reviewed
National Science Foundation grant applications that might be relevant
to signals intelligence or communications security. The purported
reason for these reviews was for the NSA to advise the NSF on the
proposalsâ âtechnical merits,â but the agency appeared to use this
process to exercise control over nongovernmental cryptography
For instance, the NSA reviewed and approved an NSF grant application
from Ron Rivest. Later, Rivest used the funds to develop the
enormously influential RSA cryptosystem, which secures most encrypted
Internet traffic today. An internal NSA history suggests that the
agency would have tried to derail Rivestâs grant application if the
reviewers had understood what Rivest would do with the money. The NSA
missed this opportunity, the history complains, because the wording of
Rivestâs proposal âwas so general that the Agency did not spot the
threatâ posed by the project.
In 1979, Leonard Adleman (another member of the RSA triumvirate)
applied to the NSF for funding and had his application forwarded to
the NSA. According to Whitfield Diffie and Susan Landauâs 2007 book,
Privacy on the Line, the NSA offered to fund the research in lieu of
the NSF. Fearing that his work would end up classified, Adleman
protested and eventually received an NSF grant.
Even though the NSF appears to have maintained some level of
independence from NSA influence, the agency likely has had greater
control over other federal funding sources. In particular, the
Department of Defense funds research through the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Naval Research, the
Army Research Office and other offices. After the run-in with the
academic community in the late 1970s, the NSA history asserts that
Vice Adm. Inman âsecure[d] a commitmentâ that the Office of Naval
Research would coordinate its grants with the NSA. Since funding
agencies often need not explain why they have rejected a particular
grant proposal, it is hard to judge the NSAâs effect on the
grant-making process.
The agency has a second tactic to prevent the spread of cryptographic
techniques: keeping high-grade cryptography out of the national
standards. To make it easier for different commercial computer systems
to interoperate, the National Bureau of Standards (now called NIST)
coordinates a semipublic process to design standard cryptographic
algorithms. Vendors are hesitant to implement algorithms that are not
in the NIST standards: Non-standard algorithms are harder to deploy in
practice and are less likely to see adoption in the open marketplace.
The first controversy over the NSAâs hand in these standards erupted
in the 1970s when it persuaded the bureau to weaken the Data
Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, an NBS-designed cryptosystem
widely used by banks, privacy-sensitive businesses and the public.
Hellman and his then-student Diffie mounted a vigorousâââand
ultimately unsuccessfulâââpublic relations campaign to try to improve
the strength of the DES algorithm.
At the time, NSA leadership emphatically denied that it had influenced
the DES design. In a public speech in 1979 aimed to quell some of the
controversy, Inman asserted: âNSA has been accused of intervening in
the development of the DES and of tampering with the standard so as to
weaken it cryptographically. This allegation is totally false.â
Recently declassified documents reveal that Inmanâs statements were
misleading, if not incorrect. The NSA tried to convince IBM (which had
originally designed the DES algorithm) to reduce the DES key size from
64 to 48 bits. Reducing the key size would decrease the cost of
certain attacks against the cryptosystem. The NSA and IBM eventually
compromised, the history says, on using a weakened 56-bit key.
Today, Inman acknowledges that the NSA was trying to strike a balance
be-tween protecting domestic commercial communication and safeguarding
its own ability to eavesdrop on foreign governments: â[T]he issue was
to try to find a level of cryptography that ensured the privacy of
individuals and companies against competitors. Against anyone other
than a country with a dedicated effort and capability to break the
The NSAâs influence over the standards process has been particularly
effective at mitigating what it perceived as the risks of
nongovernmental cryptography. By keeping certain cryptosystems out of
the NBS/NIST standards, the NSA facilitated its mission of
eavesdropping on communications traffic.
Reflections on Secrecy
There are a few salient questions to consider when looking back at
these first conflicts between the intelligence community and academic
researchers in cryptography. A starting point for this analysis, said
Aftergood, is to consider âwhether in retrospect, [the governmentâs]
worst fears were realized.â
According to Inman, the uptake of the research communityâs
cryptographic ideas came at a much slower pace than he had expected.
As a result, less foreign traffic ended up being encrypted than the
agency had projected, and the consequences for national security were
not as dramatic as he had feared. Essentially, Inman recalled, âthere
was no demandâ for encryption systems outside of governments, even
though many high-grade systems eventually became available. âYou had a
supply but no demand for it.â Even those people who try to use
high-grade cryptographic tools, Hellman said, often make mistakes that
render their traffic easy for an intelligence agency to decrypt:
âPeople still make a lot of mistakes: use wrong, bad keys, or whatever
A second question is whether Hellman was right to worry that a lack of
strong cryptography could become an âeconomic and privacy threatâ in a
computerized economy. In an unexpected turn, today Inman is as worried
about protecting nongovernmental computer systems as Hellman was in
the 1970s. When asked if he would make the same decisions about
nongovernmental cryptography now as he did then, Inman replied,
âRather than being careful to make sure they were[nât] going to damage
[our collection capabilities] . . . I would have been interested in
how quickly they were going to be able to make [cryptosystems]
available in a form that would protect proprietary information as well
as government information.â
The theft of portions of the designs for the F-35 jet, Inman said,
demonstrates that weak nongovernmental encryption and computer
security practices can grievously harm national security. Even though
history has vindicated Martin Hellman, he adamantly refuses to gloat
over the accuracy of his predictions and the far-reaching impact of
his technical work. On the contrary, Hellman is still deeply troubled
by the way he engaged in the debate with the NSA over the publication
of his papers and the DES encryption standard.
Rather than trying to understand both sides of the issue and make the
ârightâ decision, Hellman said that in the heat of the controversy, he
listened to his ego instead. âThe thought just popped into my head:
Forget about whatâs right. Go with this, youâve got a tiger by the
tail. Youâll never have more of an impact on society.â
Aftergood said that this sort of ego-driven reasoning is a hallmark of
debates over secrecy in research: âIf youâre a researcher and youâve
achieved some kind of breakthrough, youâre going to want to let people
know. So youâre not a neutral, impartial, disinterested party. Youâre
an interested party.â
It was not until Hellman watched Day After Trinity, a documentary
about the development of the atomic bomb, that he realized how
dangerous his decision-making process had been. The moment in the film
that troubled him most, he recalled, was when the Manhattan Project
scientists tried to explain why they continued to work on the bomb
after Hitler had been defeated and the threat of a German atom bomb
had disappeared. The scientists âhad figured out what they wanted to
do and had then come up with a rationalization for doing it, rather
than figuring out the right thing to do and doing it whether or not it
was what they wanted to do. . . . I vowed I would never do that
again,â Hellman said. âThinking it through even now, I still would
have done most of what I did. But it could have been something as bad
as inventing nuclear weapons, and so I vowed I would never do that
Making good decisions in these situations, Aftergood said, requires a
large dose of âinternal restraintâ and a certain âdegree of trustâ
between researchers and government officials, âwhich is often lacking
in practice.â
Although Hellman and Inman forged an unlikely friendship in the wake
of the conflict in the late 1970s, trust between the academic
cryptography community and the NSA is at its nadir. Inman said of the
new NSA director, âHe has a huge challenge on his plate. How does he .
. . can he, in fact, reestablish a sense of trust?â
Diffie and Hellmanâs now-legendary key-exchange algorithm has an
elegant one-line representation. Debates over academic freedom and
government secrecy do not lend themselves to such a concise
formulation. âItâs not a neat, simple calculation,â Aftergood said.
âThere are competing interests on all sides, and somehow one just has
to muddle through.â

@_subject: Fwd: [seL4 Announce] seL4-based "RefOS" released 
Today we announce the release of the RefOS project.  RefOS is an OS
personality that runs on seL4. RefOS stands for "Reference OS", the
aspirational goal of the project, which is to provide a reference OS
personality for seL4.
RefOS is a student project built as a case study to explore more
dynamic virtual memory (VM) management systems than the typical static
systems architected on separation kernels. When compared to statically
allocated systems, a key difference (and complexity) of dynamic VM
management is relaxing the assumption that virtual memory (and memory
objects) are managed by a single task upon the microkernel (or by the
microkernel itself).
RefOS has a distributed VM framework inspired by the Sawmill VM
framework [1], though differing in the centralisation of some core
book-keeping into a single server (mainly fault forwarding and mapping
authorisation). An additional goal of the project was to create
tension between user-level and kernel-level VM primitives to enable
ongoing kernel experimentation in the area of higher-level VM
The current functionality of RefOS consists of processes, an
in-memory boot-image file server, and console support. Additionally,
some games and test applications have been ported to the system.
RefOS is available at  under a
"BSD 2-Clause" license.

âTo those of us who have to tackle the depressing end of intelligence
community behaviour on the internet, it can seem that all governments,
telcos, and computing companies are in denial about its misuse."
 [ paraphrased for relevance ]
- GCHQ chief accuses US tech giants of becoming terrorists' 'networks of choice'
New director of UK eavesdropping agency accuses US tech firms of
becoming ânetworks of choiceâ for terrorists
Privacy has never been âan absolute rightâ, according to the new
director of GCHQ, who has used his first public intervention since
taking over at the helm of Britainâs surveillance agency to accuse US
technology companies of becoming âthe command and control networks of
choiceâ for terrorists.
Robert Hannigan said a new generation of freely available technology
has helped groups like Islamic State (Isis) to hide from the security
services and accuses major tech firms of being âin denialâ, going
further than his predecessor in seeking to claim that the leaks of
Edward Snowden have aided terror networks.
GCHQ and sister agencies including MI5 cannot tackle those challenges
without greater support from the private sector, âincluding the
largest US technology companies which dominate the webâ, Hannigan
argued in an opinion piece written for the Financial Times just days
into his new job.
Arguing that GCHQ needed to enter into the debate about privacy,
Hannigan said: âI think we have a good story to tell. We need to show
how we are accountable for the data we use to protect people, just as
the private sector is increasingly under pressure to show how it
filters and sells its customersâ data.
âGCHQ is happy to be part of a mature debate on privacy in the digital
age. But privacy has never been an absolute right and the debate about
this should not become a reason for postponing urgent and difficult
Hannigan, who was born in Gloucestershire, not far from GCHQâs base,
has advised the prime minister on counter-terrorism, intelligence and
security policy, goes on to take aim at the role of major technology
companies. A senior Foreign Office official, Hannigan succeeded Sir
Iain Lobban at the Cheltenham-based surveillance agency.
âTo those of us who have to tackle the depressing end of human
behaviour on the internet, it can seem that some technology companies
are in denial about its misuse.
âI suspect most ordinary users of the internet are ahead of them: they
have strong views on the ethics of companies, whether on taxation,
child protection or privacy; they do not want the media platforms they
use with their friends and families to facilitate murder or child
Hannigan asserts that the members of the public âknowâ the internet
grew out of the values of western democracy and insists that customers
of the technology firms he criticises would be âcomfortable with a
better, more sustainable relationship between the agencies and the
technology companies.â
Heading towards the 25th anniversary of the creation of the world wide
web, he calls for a ânew dealâ between democratic governments and the
technology companies in the area of protecting citizens.
âIt should be a deal rooted in the democratic values we share. That
means addressing some uncomfortable truths. Better to do it now than
in the aftermath of greater violence.â
In the same piece, Hannigan says Isis differs from its predecessors in
the security of its communications, presenting an even greater
challenge to the security services.
 âTerrorists have always found ways of hiding their
operations. But today mobile technology and smartphones have increased
the options available exponentially.
âTechniques for encrypting messages or making them anonymous which
were once the preserve of the most sophisticated criminals or nation
states now come as standard. These are supplemented by freely
available programs and apps adding extra layers of security, many of
them proudly advertising that they are âSnowden approvedâ. There is no
doubt that young foreign fighters have learnt and benefited from the
leaks of the past two years.â
Among the advocates of privacy protection who reacted to Hanniganâs
comments, the deputy director of Privacy International, Eric King,
said: âItâs disappointing to see GCHQâs new director refer to the
internet â the greatest tool for innovation, access to education and
communication humankind has ever known â as a command-and-control
network for terrorists.â
King added: âBefore he condemns the efforts of companies to protect
the privacy of their users, perhaps he should reflect on why there has
been so much criticism of GCHQ in the aftermath of the Snowden
revelations. GCHQâs dirty games â forcing companies to handover their
customersâ data under secret orders, then secretly tapping the private
fibre optic cables between the same companiesâ data centres anyway â
have lost GCHQ the trust of the public, and of the companies who
services we use. Robert Hannigan is right, GCHQ does need to enter the
public debate about privacy - but attacking the internet isnât the
right way to do it.â
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) meanwhile rejected the notion
that an agreement between companies and governments was needed.
Jillian York, director of international free expression at EFF said:
âA special âdealâ between governments and companies isnât necessary -
law enforcement can conduct open source intelligence on
publicly-posted content on social networks, and can already place
legal requests with respect to users. Allowing governments special
access to private content is not only a violation of privacy, it may
also serve to drive terrorists underground, making the job of law
enforcement even more difficult.â
Welcoming Hanniganâs participation in the public debate, the Labour
Party MP Tom Watson said it helped to map out where we should draw the
line on privacy and helps the same agencies âto rebuild their
legitimacy post-Snowdenâ.
But he added: âI hope they do not confuse the use of public propaganda
through social media by extremists with the use of the covert
communications. It is illogical to say that because Isis use Twitter,
all our metadata should be collected without warrant.â
Hanniganâs comments come after the director of the FBI, James Comey,
called for âa regulatory or legislative fixâ for technology companiesâ
expanding use of encryption to protect user privacy.
Reacting last month to the introduction of strong default encryption
by Apple and Google on their latest mobile operating systems, Comey
said âthe post-Snowden pendulum has swung too far in one direction -
in a direction of fear and mistrust.â
âJustice may be denied because of a locked phone or an encrypted hard
drive,â said Comey. Without a compromise, âhomicide cases could be
stalled, suspects could walk free, and child exploitation victims
might not be identified or recovered.â

A Practical Attack Against the HIVE Hidden Volume Encryption System
Kenneth G. Paterson and Mario Strefler
Abstract: The HIVE hidden volume encryption system was proposed by
Blass et al. at ACM-CCS 2014. Even though HIVE has a security proof,
this paper demonstrates an attack on its implementation that breaks
the main security property claimed for the system by its authors,
namely plausible hiding against arbitrary-access adversaries. Our
attack is possible because of HIVE's reliance on the RC4 stream cipher
to fill unused blocks with pseudorandom data. While the attack can be
easily eliminated by using a better pseudorandom generator, it serves
as an example of why RC4 should be avoided in all new applications and
a reminder that one has to be careful when instantiating primitives.

@_subject: Fwd: [tor-talk] Cloak Tor Router 
first question, did you contact Tor Project Inc. about this for their
input? (if yes, what was their take on your aims?)
the majority of these repositories are forks of existing public
projects, but not clearly so. (e.g. cloak-routing is a selection of
specific OpenWRT packages, eschalot, etc.)
what do you think of branching from upstream repositories, and keeping
your changes in a manner that upstream would be encouraged to
i have more feedback on code itself, but this is foremost to mention.
i approve of open hardware approach very much :)
perhaps useful to identify what is open (like PCB) and what is not (Atheros)
obviously this is not difficult, but it is also more complicated than
just "some sensible rules". e.g.
 and
iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP and all the
other intricacies...
it would also be great if you could introduce some per-device unique
entropy seed, obtained from a strong hardware based random number
generator. (how better to signal your interest in utmost privacy, even
if practical benefit is less concrete? :)
the concept of a portable Tor proxy hardware router that fits in your
pocket is great, in my not so unbiased opinion :)
what technical people will frown on is the way the device is presented
to users, and if users are placed into risk by technical errors.
that's fine; i believe it is possible to make a device that is
transparently usable that also doesn't put users at needless risk, if
that is what you are getting at.
the suggestions others have made that i second:
- block accidental Tor over Tor setups.
- provide a Tor Browser on the supported platforms with TOR_TRANSPROXY=1
- provide automated builds, so that users can keep their device up to
date easily, or use a built-in mechanism to obtain and install the
latest easily.
in general, some guidelines that me as a technical person would like to see:
- the device should fail safe, rather than fail open: if i
accidentally connect my friend's windows XP laptop to your device, it
should block rather than allow all by default.
- support robust stream isolation, beyond what may be default. perhaps
IsolateDestAddr and IsolateByClientAddr on TransPort (this does not
yet exist, but you could code it to the benefit of all Transparent
proxy consumers :)
regarding your other information:
from your kickstarter, "We commit to establish and operate new exit
nodes, to ensure that we are pulling our weight. Tor is currently at
approx 2000 users per exit node. For every 1000 devices we ship, we
will establish a new dedicated exit node. "
why the focus on number of exit nodes, instead of contributed exit
capacity?  you're measuring the wrong thing here.
i have more feedback, but your responses to these questions will help
me determine how much time i can contribute to an evaluation.

someone asked, "then why the names and ..?"
if i was implementing this attack, i would want the attacked to assume
it was a mis-configured bot. this looks like a mis-configured bot.
only by watching established connections, and the rate of client
request data sent over them, would you be able to identify this type
of malicious attack was taking place.
morals of this story:
- never assume a crash or DoS is innocuous on the Tor network.
- always get packet captures to diagnose trouble! (not just request logs)
- "the old tricks, still the best tricks..."
- and DON'T record traffic on a relay or exit! this is likely to harm
others while you attempt to be proactive. the last thing Tor needs is
relays and exits breaking the very privacy it is intended to provide

your ConstrainedSockets experiments are exactly what i would expect to
see if this technique were used, since reducing socket buffers would
allow you to have more concurrent connections open (and thus thwart a
DoS at lower limits).
note that the next level of breakage might show up at file descriptor
limits in processes like Tor or your Nginx server.  ulimits tuning
also suggested. (i like to use 32-64k as soft limit for all processes
on a server by default, and 0.25mm for front-end proxies running
Nginx/HAProxy or related services.)
last but not least, if you are pushing to extreme levels of
concurrence, be sure to disable CONNTRACK in iptables/xtables.

thanks for the transparency, nachash! i am putting this conversation
on tor-talk, since my replies are more noise and less dev, and the
details seem to be around Tor use and configuration.
the pcap dumps would have been most useful, as the access logs only
identify state transitions. these types of attacks likely utilized
many concurrent requests (perhaps just sending a few bytes of the
request string at once, bit by bit, until a request is complete)
performance analysis and tuning of internet sytems is difficult, and
even more so in this context!  (and performance in anonymity systems
is easily reversed for de-anonymizing DoS)
Andrea's distribution shows this type of behavior, as i would expect it:
e.g. send small bits to keep connection active and not closed by
server side client send timeouts, then around 900-1000 chars call it
good and finalize the request.
this may be application of slowloris type DoS to "encourage" HS
operator to use a vulnerable path, or confirm via side channel. (you
stated your web server bound to localhost, so the obvious ones you
avoided at least :)
of all the virtualization environments, i dislike OpenVZ the most. i
dislike all virtual hosting, however, so don't assume this is a vote
for Docker ;)

ok, maybe a dedi not an option if you're that tight for cash... :/

yup. hence slappy fights over the HSDir descriptor publishing is going
to be effective for who knows how long...
this was an international effort, so perhaps just one hand not talking

to clarify, the POTUS jammin' described by OP is a simple, and brute
case.  however, there is precedent for "intelligent jamming", where
attempts to avoid the specific DoS using wide band, complex encoding
would be met with a specific wide-band, complex response telling you
to get stuffed. these systems cooperate together, and surely
countermeasures are in place if you evade the trivial measures.
note that avoiding POTUS jammin' is a violation of FCC regs,  etc,...
a shielded, passive receiver would be overwhelmed by the brute flood.
they probably use a few tens of watts EIRP at most, unless they need
to react to a perceived threat to penetrate that barrier. military

here's the game:
a. you control power

of service. but range can also extend to beam form in addition to beam
power, of course, a similar game of effort - rise above the elevated
noise floor for the win.
a different type of attack and avoidance, in coding complexity, even
up to logical protocol DoS.
thus, to be the most difficult to deter, you would max all three: very

efficiency (which in turn drives power consumption) is paramount.

@_subject: Fwd: [Announce] GnuPG 2.1.0 "modern" released 
The GnuPG Project is pleased to announce the availability of a
new release: Version 2.1.0.
The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a complete and free implementation of
the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC-4880 and better known as PGP.
GnuPG, also known as GPG, allows to encrypt and sign data and
communication, features a versatile key management system as well as
access modules for public key directories.  GnuPG itself is a command
line tool with features for easy integration with other applications.
A wealth of frontend applications and libraries making use of GnuPG
are available.  Since version 2 GnuPG provides support for S/MIME and
Secure Shell in addition to OpenPGP.
GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can
be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.
Three different versions of GnuPG are actively maintained:
- GnuPG "modern" (2.1) is the latest development with a lot of new
  features.  This announcement is about the first release of this
  version.
- GnuPG "stable" (2.0) is the current stable version for general use.
  This is what most users are currently using.
- GnuPG "classic" (1.4) is the old standalone version which is most
  suitable for older or embedded platforms.
You may not install "modern" (2.1) and "stable" (2.0) at the same
time.  However, it is possible to install "classic" (1.4) along with
any of the other versions.
What's New in GnuPG-2.1
  - The file "secring.gpg" is not anymore used to store the secret
    keys.  Merging of secret keys is now supported.
  - All support for PGP-2 keys has been removed for security reasons.
  - The standard key generation interface is now much leaner.  This
    will help a new user to quickly generate a suitable key.
  - Support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is now available.
  - Commands to create and sign keys from the command line without any
    extra prompts are now available.
  - The Pinentry may now show the new passphrase entry and the
    passphrase confirmation entry in one dialog.
  - There is no more need to manually start the gpg-agent.  It is now
    started by any part of GnuPG as needed.
  - Problems with importing keys with the same long key id have been
    addressed.
  - The Dirmngr is now part of GnuPG proper and also takes care of
    accessing keyserver.
  - Keyserver pools are now handled in a smarter way.
  - A new format for locally storing the public keys is now used.
    This considerable speeds up operations on large keyrings.
  - Revocation certificates are now created by default.
  - Card support has been updated, new readers and token types are
    supported.
  - The format of the key listing has been changed to better identify
    the properties of a key.
  - The gpg-agent may now be used on Windows as a Pageant replacement
    for Putty in the same way it is used for years on Unix as
    ssh-agent replacement.
  - Creation of X.509 certificates has been improved.  It is now also

Getting the Software
Please follow the instructions found at  or
read on:
GnuPG 2.1.0 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or
direct from its primary FTP server.  The list of mirrors can be found
at  .  Note that GnuPG is not available
at ftp.gnu.org.
On ftp.gnupg.org you find these files:
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2  (3039k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2.sig
This is the GnuPG 2.1 source code compressed using BZIP2 and its
OpenPGP signature.
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.exe  (6225k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.exe.sig
This is an experimental installer for Windows including GPA as
graphical key manager and GpgEX as an Explorer extension.  Please
de-install an already installed Gpg4win version before trying this
installer.  This binary version has not been tested very well, thus it
is likely that you will run into problems.  The complete source code
for the software included in this installer is in the same directory;
use the suffix ".tar.xz" instead of ".exe".
Although several beta versions have been released over the course of
the last years, no extensive public field test has been done.  Thus it
is likely that bugs will show up.  Please check the mailing list
archives and the new wiki  for latest
information on known problems and workaround.
Checking the Integrity
In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of
the following ways:
 * If you already have a version of GnuPG installed, you can simply
   verify the supplied signature.  For example to verify the signature
   of the file gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2 you would use this command:
     gpg --verify gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2.sig
   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that
   this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint
   against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by
   checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.
   See below for information on the signing keys.
 * If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have
   to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do
   this is either "sha1sum" or "shasum".  Assuming you downloaded the
   file gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2, you would run the command like this:
     sha1sum gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2
   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:
2fcd0ca6889ef6cb59e3275e8411f8b7778c2f33  gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2
9907cb6509a0e63331b27a92e25c1ef956caaf3b  gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.exe
28dc1365292c61fbb2bbae730d4158f425463c91  gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.tar.xz
Release Signing Keys
To guarantee that a downloaded GnuPG version has not been tampered by
malicious entities we provide signature files for all tarballs and
binary versions.  The keys are also signed by the long term keys of
their respective owners.  Current releases are signed by one or more
of these four keys:
  2048R/4F25E3B6 2011-01-12
  Key fingerprint = D869 2123 C406 5DEA 5E0F  3AB5 249B 39D2 4F25 E3B6
  Werner Koch (dist sig)
  rsa2048/E0856959 2014-10-29
  Key fingerprint = 46CC 7308 65BB 5C78 EBAB  ADCF 0437 6F3E E085 6959
  David Shaw (GnuPG Release Signing Key)   rsa2048/33BD3F06 2014-10-29
  Key fingerprint = 031E C253 6E58 0D8E A286  A9F2 2071 B08A 33BD 3F06
  NIIBE Yutaka (GnuPG Release Key)   rsa2048/7EFD60D9 2014-10-19
  Key fingerprint = D238 EA65 D64C 67ED 4C30  73F2 8A86 1B1C 7EFD 60D9
  Werner Koch (Release Signing Key)
You may retrieve these files from the keyservers using this command
  gpg --recv-keys 249B39D24F25E3B6 04376F3EE0856959 \
                  2071B08A33BD3F06 8A861B1C7EFD60D9
The keys are also available at and in the released GnuPG tarball in the file g10/distsigkey.gpg .
Note that this mail has been signed using my standard PGP key.
This new branch of GnuPG has support for 4 languages: French, German,
Japanese, and Ukrainian.  More translations can be expected with the
next point releases.
If you used GnuPG in the past you should read the description of
changes and new features at doc/whats-new-in-2.1.txt or online at
  The file gnupg.info has the complete user manual of the system.
Separate man pages are included as well but they have not all the
details available in the manual.  It is also possible to read the
complete manual online in HTML format at
  or in Portable Document Format at
   .
The chapters on gpg-agent, gpg and gpgsm include information on how
to set up the whole thing.  You may also want search the GnuPG mailing
list archives or ask on the gnupg-users mailing lists for advise on
how to solve problems.  Many of the new features are around for
several years and thus enough public knowledge is already available.
Please consult the archive of the gnupg-users mailing list before
reporting a bug .
We suggest to send bug reports for a new release to this list in favor
of filing a bug at .  For commercial support
requests we keep a list of known service companies at:
  The driving force behind the development of GnuPG is the company of
its principal author, Werner Koch.  Maintenance and improvement of
GnuPG and related software takes up most of their resources.  To allow
him to continue this work he kindly asks to either purchase a support
contract, engage g10 Code for custom enhancements, or to donate money:
  We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it
testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, administering the
servers, spreading the word, and answering questions on the mailing
lists.  A final big Thank You goes to Hal Finney, who too early passed
away this year.  Hal worked on PGP and helped to make OpenPGP a great
standard; it has been a pleasure having worked with him.

they crushed Aaron because they could,
 they destroy lives across the globe because they can,
  my fellow frogs in the boiling pot,
   how much is too much?
Iâd been asked by the headmaster of Northshore Country Day to come and
speak to the middle school, and, for some reason, there was this 10 or
11 year old that was in among the middle schoolers. And I spent the
afternoon â this was a time when, I donât think there were that many
people who felt the way I did about this stuff. Most of them are in
this room now. And I was promoting the idea that we could make a world
where anybody anywhere could give his thirst for knowledge and his
curiosity everything that it wanted to know. And *anybody* could know
as much as any human being knew about any thing, in the future. He
didnât say much. He was extremely memorable, however. He was much
younger. He was all eyes, and mind, andâ¦spiritual radiance, in a way.
And I scarcely saw him again.
But years laterâ¦ Last year, at one point, when I was with a bunch of
copyright barons in Paris at the EG8, and they were all talking about
how enforcement and education was gonna come out right, and it was
gonna be just like the War on some Drugs. And I happened to be on a
panel with these guys. I said âyou know, you think youâve won this
thing, or you will win this thing. But the truth is that youâve turned
a whole generation into an electronic Hezbollah. And you will be dead
when they are alive. And I was thinking of Aaron Swartz and itâs
really very difficult for me to see that he is dead, and they are
alive. But he is not dead, and they will be.
i cried when Aaron died,
 i raged when Snowden leaked,
  yet now i am calm and dedicated.

i used to agree with this, and then i realized this is bad advice if
incremental improvements are resulting in less security over time.
said another way, if you are currently falling behind quickly, by not
moving, then moving ahead at a walk just means you fail less soon than
everyone ends up in fail, however.
i think this is only true if the magnitude of broken and incompetent
crushes you into inaction.
if instead it spurs you to build, for years, on something of a solid
base, then criticism must be deferred until that base is put to the
of course, my time spent writing rebuttal subtracted from the time

"I don't have a revocation key or a subkey" - admission of guilt?
this is sane practice compared to lesser alternatives of:
 - using revocations keys or subkeys improperly, leading to

 - not using crypto at all, out of frustration.
 - using non-end-to-end encryption, out of frustration.

with defense in depth, this is a reasonable solution.

... GreedyBTS can be used to assist security researchers and analysts
performing assessments of mobile connectivity in environments, as well
as highlighting risks to organisations who may transfer potentially
sensitive information over wireless devices. An increasing number of
embedded systems have turned to GSM as a management channel, such as
alarm panels, street lighting, safety systems and more, which could
all be susceptible to man-in-the-middle and rogue BTS attacks.
The current state of baseband security means that it is difficult to
detect and determine if you or your devices are being targeted by
malicious BTS environments. The tools that do exist are aimed at power
users which makes wider adoption by business or consumers an
increasingly difficult task. By sharing information that can assist
security researchers we hope to increase the overall security of
mobile devices and cause people to re-think how they handle sensitive
information over GSM environments...

2. technical sophistication pursuing these prosecutions is now, thanks
to the cyber-industrial-complex, at a point where law enforcement uses
techniques recently considered nation state intelligence caliber.
thus to pursue "activist security journalism" that is not powers that

your threat model is:
 securing yourself and your sources against

   including tailored access and special collection.

tools would suffice. no one wants to touch the hot potato unless

thanks, checking them out. one thing i don't see mentioned is how the
OCR was performed. same as Reuters DocumentCloud service, or open

next bigsun update will demonstrate this challenge better, as i am
using a handful of techniques for text extraction, character
recognition, and annotation, as well.  in a sense, this is how the
sausage making gets started...

"you want me to consent to make my FBI file public? Are you fucking mad?"
 - i am currently making requests through MuckRock.com which i recommend
for their helpful and dedicated staff, as well as their time devoted
to review and reporting on released information.
i am using the professional service, which lets you set requests
private until reviewed and ready to release publicly.  this implies a
bit of trust in MuckRock, and i hope it is not misplaced.
few years back i asked for participants in a similar effort. some
things resulted:
1) this also opens up the requester to risk; that is, whoever is
filing must also potentially show some trust, if a falsified DOJ-361
is sent and used as pretext to "deter" you.  i have not heard of this
actually happening, but i was also not willing to push it.
  '''beware who you accept, coder,
    or they're setting you up for USC 18 fuckery.
    sure, it may in the end be ok.
      but you're in misery until cleared.''''
2) the information is going to be public; if you've got a file because
you're a privacy enthusiast, then filing to make your file public is
the opposite of enjoying your privacy.  there is merit in taking one
for team earth human, however...

And I'll go one further. Everything's secret. I mean, I got an e-mail

that for the most of its existence was well served by not having a
public image. When the nation felt its existence was threatened, it
was willing to cut agencies like NSA quite a bit of slack. But as that
threat perception decreases, there is a natural tendency to say, "Now,

 or reduced option command line pdf2txt, or pdftotext, or
   also:

John mentioned, all the metadatas and annotations typically unseen,
consider that the specific "configuration and input parsing" as a
"profile" for a given "input document" identified by "self certifying
identifier" for all of the above results in collaborative simplified
text paragraphs as a working base.
so sha256(generated corpora) == sha256(sha256(doc)  ^ sha256(config of
parse opts) ^ sha256(parse-product) )
if i use a convenient generated slang, ...
this means at least a dozen "to text" engines with configuration,
(parse opts and parse products) per input document as a working state.
and ten to twenty times the input pages as simplified output text
paragraphs (common base) collected from the useful parts of the best
transformations, used for subsequent text based natural language
in a sense, this is devops come to document processing, where the
process itself is embodied in version controlled and complete archives
with self certifying integrity. this means boring, and also done
decades ago, more or less, in varying contexts. everything old is new
again ;P
there are a whole field of customer parser and data sets and scrapers
all dedicated to variations on this theme, although sadly they don't

@_author: coderman 
@_subject: Re: www.nsa-observer.net 
we can wax lyrical about all the ways to sanitize a boundary through
constraint, perhaps twice over, to be sure?
that said, consider a Qubes OS setup where conversion between formats
(app domains) was always to least complicated, most easy to verify
well formed, even constraint through omission type simplifications,
then a PDF to plain-text 80 column by 42 lines per page fixed width
ASCII printable only
could probably be interpreted into sentences that would be a way to
collaborate separately without excessively leaking information among
participants, maybe.
in other words, PDFs and similar rich, obfuscated types are the
adversaries playground. does this mean all PDFs are compromised? Of
course not. But if you're a target, a specific PDF of specific
structure could very well be an effective honey token and target you
consider a watermark, that resized half, still persists. this is the
kind of meta leval manipulation of structure you may see in a rich
document (PDF) that could still persist in some transformations.
in other words, it depends on your threat model - who is tainting your
documents in-line, silently, without your awares,
and how complicated the formats and resulting transformations.
as another example, this is why referencing even simplified subsets of
text by a self certifying identifier, like
afb1e384e450d644703ad96cdfe9f728be509854388687eb65b7c622e2f798a9 ,
e.g. bigsundaawafn36e.onion/shid/afb/1e3/afb1e384e450d644..5b7c622e2f798a9
 or which is the same paragraph in ascii no matter PDF or Word or HTML
origin simplified to text paragraph.
then, mutually un-trusting individuals collaborating from a distance,
can use this shared address space as the base for cooperation.

don't use clear-web, not even once. not even one-way. it is DEF CON

this includes:
 - don't use DNS
 - don't use HTTP over public IPv4 or IPv6
 - don't use HTTPS over public IPv4 or IPv6
 - don't use TCP over public IPv4 of IPv6
 - do use UDP VPN at least past first last-mile ISP, most likely to be
onery and RST'ery.
 - do use Tor bridges to avoid like UDP VPN above, with even better cover.
 - must use resume capable HTTP/1.1 range based capable client with
secure digest verification!
 (multiple reports of cryptome.org streams of Cfour.7z getting RST
inline, or otherwise frequent and frustrating failures before complete
on some specific provider networks; bonus points for RST inject
filtering, but not all OS support it.)
for array of onion hosts (location hidden mirrors)
 - 5 x connections, to 5 of 9 onions, max two conns per host
 - 18 x connections to 9 onions, two conns per host [ e.g. aria2c
--piece-length=1M --min-split-size=1M --split=18

1.  Introduction
   The Tor network [Dingledine2004] has the ability to host network
   services using the ".onion" Top-Level Domain.  Such addresses can be
   used as other domain names would be (e.g., in URLs [RFC3986]), but
   instead of using the DNS infrastructure, .onion names are hashes that
   correspond to the identity of a given service, thereby combining
   location and authentication.
   In this way, .onion names are "special" in the sense defined by
   [RFC6761] Section 3; they require hardware and software
   implementations to change their handling, in order to achieve the
   desired properties of the name (see Section 4).  These differences
   are listed in Section 2.
   Like other TLDs, .onion addresses can have an arbitrary number of
   subdomain components.  This information is not meaningful to the Tor
   protocol, but can be used in application protocols like HTTP
   [RFC7230].
   See [tor-address] and [tor-rendezvous] for the details of the
   creation and use of .onion names.
1.1.  Notational Conventions
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
2.  The ".onion" Special-Use TLD
   These properties have the following effects upon parties using or
   processing .onion names (as per [RFC6761]):
   1.  Users: human users are expected to recognize .onion names as
       having different security properties, and also being only
       available through software that is aware of onion addresses.
   2.  Application Software: Applications that implement the Tor
       protocol MUST recognize .onion names as special by either
       accessing them directly, or using a proxy (e.g., SOCKS [RFC1928])
       to do so.  Applications that do not implement the Tor protocol
       SHOULD generate an error upon the use of .onion, and SHOULD NOT
       perform a DNS lookup.
   3.  Name Resolution APIs and Libraries: Resolvers that implement the
       Tor protocol MUST either respond to requests for .onion names by
       resolving them (see [tor-rendezvous]) or by responding with
       NXDOMAIN.  Other resolvers SHOULD respond with NXDOMAIN.
   4.  Caching DNS Servers: Caching servers SHOULD NOT attempt to look
       up records for .onion names.  They SHOULD generate NXDOMAIN for
       all such queries.
   5.  Authoritative DNS Servers: Authoritative servers SHOULD respond
       to queries for .onion with NXDOMAIN.
   6.  DNS Server Operators: Operators SHOULD NOT configure an
       authoritative DNS server to answer queries for .onion.  If they
       do so, client software is likely to ignore any results (see
       above).
   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars: Registrars MUST NOT register .onion
       names; all such requests MUST be denied.
3.  IANA Considerations
   This document registers the "onion" TLD in the registry of Special-
   Use Domain Names [RFC6761].  See Section 2 for the registration
   template.
4.  Security Considerations
   .onion names are often used provide access to end to end encrypted,
   secure, anonymized services; that is, the identity and location of
   the server is obscured from the client.  The location of the client
   is obscured from the server.  The identity of the client may or may
   not be disclosed through an optional cryptographic authentication
   process.
   These properties can be compromised if, for example:
   o  The server "leaks" its identity in another way (e.g., in an
      application-level message), or
   o  The access protocol is implemented or deployed incorrectly, or
   o  The access protocol itself is found to have a flaw.
   .onion names are self-authenticating, in that they are derived from
   the cryptographic keys used by the server in a client verifiable
   manner during connection establishment.  As a result, the
   cryptographic label component of a .onion name is not intended to be
   human-meaningful.
   The Tor network is designed to not be subject to any central
   controlling authorities with regards to routing and service
   publication, so .onion names cannot be registered, assigned,
   transferred or revoked.  "Ownership" of a .onion name is derived
   solely from control of a public/private key pair which corresponds to
   the algorithmic derivation of the name.
   Users must take special precautions to ensure that the .onion name
   they are communicating with is correct, as attackers may be able to
   find keys which produce service names that are visually or apparently
   semantically similar to the desired service.
   Also, users need be aware of the difference between a .onion name
   used and accessed directly via Tor-capable software, versus .onion
   subdomains of other TLDs and providers (e.g., the difference between
   example.onion and example.onion.tld).
   The cryptographic label for an .onion name is constructed by hashing
   the public key of the service with SHA1, truncating the output of the
   hash to 80 bits in length and the resulting hash output is
   concatenated with the string ".onion".  As the number of output bits
   in generating the .onion name is less than the full size of the
   corresponding public key, an attacker may also be able to find a key
   that produces a collision with the same .onion name with
   substantially less work than a cryptographic attack on the full
   strength key.  If this is possible the attacker may be able to
   impersonate the service on the network.
   If client software attempts to resolve a .onion name, it can leak the
   identity of the service that the user is attempting to access to DNS
   resolvers, authoritative DNS servers, and observers on the
   intervening network.  This can be mitigated by following the
   recommendations in Section 2.

@_subject: Fwd: [tor-talk] Clarification of Tor's involvement with DARPA's Memex 
Hi Thomas,
Thanks for asking. I apologize for not explaining these answers
earlier. I'm still trying to find the right balance for my time between
mentoring people in the Tor community vs better broader communication too.
Let me give you some background, and then I'll answer your question.
First of all, yes indeed we've been getting some funding from the
Memex project. This is what has allowed us to pay attention to and move
forward on some of the really cool things we've been working on lately
for hidden services:
* Fixing many performance and consistency problems with hidden services,
* Fleshing out the design and analysis for the "direct onion service"
option that folks like Facebook want:
plus discussing other tradeoffs between upcoming design choices:
* The work to let Tor controllers configure a hidden service directly
without using the torrc file, which the Globaleaks folks (among others)
are really excited to start using:
* The privacy-preserving statistics that let us conclude numbers like
"3-4% of Tor traffic is hidden service related" and "there are around
30000 hidden services today":
* Assessing, triaging, and putting out new Tor releases to fix
hidden service security (stability) bugs recently:
* I hear that Rob Jansen and others have been working on a more realistic
replacement for TorPerf (
which will let us measure performance to a hidden service over time and
better understand where the bottlenecks are.
* I've also been talking to EFF about kicking off a Tor Onion Challenge
(to follow on from their Tor Relay Challenges), to a) get many people
to make their website or other service accessible as an onion site,
and b) come up with and/or build a novel use of onion services, to go
with the quite cool list that we have already but have done a poor job
of publicizing: Pond, Globaleaks, SecureDrop, Ricochet, OnionShare,
facebook's https onion, etc. You see, I used to be on the "making your
normal website reachable as an onion service is stupid" side of the fence,
but I have since come to realize that I was wrong. You know how, ten
years ago, website operators would say "I don't need to offer https for
my site, because my users ____" and they'd have some plausible-sounding
excuse? And now they sound selfish and short-sighted if they say that,
because everybody knows it should be the choice of the *user* what
security properties she gets when reaching a service? I now think onion
services are exactly in that boat: today we have plenty of people saying
"I don't need to offer a .onion for my site, because my users _____". We
need to turn it around so sites let their *users* decide what security
(encryption, authentication, trust) properties they want to achieve
while interacting with each site.
Our "3-4%" stat has actually been used by some of the other people (at
other groups) who are funded by Memex. They're talking to (among others)
the child porn division of the Department of Justice, and I've taught them
enough about Tor that they've basically turned into Tor advocates on our
behalf. They've found actual numbers to be really useful at countering the
FUD that some government people start out with. One of these people
explained to me last week that they listen to her more than she thinks
they'd listen to me, since she shows up as a neutral party. In any case
I am happy to have more people working on the "teach law enforcement
how Tor actually works" topic, which you can read more about here:
We do indeed need to be very careful and very thoughtful about what
things in the Tor network are safe to measure. The general heuristic we've
been using so far is: "Is that measurement taking advantage of something
that you could instead fix? If so, it's not ok to measure it." A prime
example here of what's over the line is running relays that get the
HSDir flag and then recording what hidden service descriptors they see
(and thus what hidden services they learn about). We would instead like
to treat that as a vulnerability and fix it:
and see also the "Attacks by Hidden Service Directory Servers" section of
as well as the section after it. (There are other researchers who have
used that technique, e.g.
 and also Gareth Owen's
talk at 31c3. But we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard.)
On the other hand, if people publish a .onion address on a normal
website and Google runs across it and indexes the name, then it seems
clear that that's public information. There are many other ways to learn
about hidden service names which are ethically in-between, e.g.
These are great topics for us as a community to keep discussing.
Similarly, if your .onion address is public, and your webserver
doesn't require any authentication, and somebody fetches the content
on it... that also seems like public information. And if, for example,
the onion service is a forum, and users go there and then write their
names down or provide other identifying information, that isn't really
a bug or design flaw that Tor can fix.
These days there are services like Ahmia that list and index a bunch of
onion names and content:
And to be clear, I think this is a great trend: we need to make onion
services easier to understand and more accessible (and faster and more
robust) for ordinary people, or we'll remain stuck with all the metaphors
that include the word 'dark'.
Ok, now that I've provided some background, I should try to answer your
question more clearly: we're using the Memex money to make hidden services
stronger, and we're teaching other people how Tor works. In terms of
teaching, it's the same thing I do for every other audience: explain about
all the projects Tor works on (Tor, Tor Browser, pluggable transports,
metrics, OONI, ...), which projects do what, how to measure and assess
Tor's anonymity, what problems we don't have great answers for, and so on.
Part of making Tor work better means that it works better for these people
too. And some of these people are indeed working on tools to gather and
organize public content from hidden services, with the intent that groups
like law enforcement will find their tools useful. We're not working
on these tools, but when Tor becomes better (for everybody) these tools
work better (for the groups they have in mind). It is a tricky balance,
but I think we have the balance right in this case.
Would I rather have funding where it's easier to find a good balance?
Absolutely. That's a major part of why we've been talking about funding
and funding diversity so much lately, and why we've been thinking about
crowdfunding specifically for hidden service design improvements, and
about growing our donation base and sustainability through donations
and other avenues. We need help from all of you to get there.
I don't want to play the "they'd do it anyway" card too strongly here --
first because who knows, maybe they wouldn't, and second because there
are definitely some activities that you stay away from no matter the
balance. I've talked a lot with the program manager of Memex, and he's
completely supportive of the "don't weaken Tor" mandate. In that sense
we're aligned: he very strongly believes that weakening Tor would screw up
this balance. I trust his intentions, and in any case we're the ones doing
the technical side of Tor so we can make sure that we do the right thing.
I should also make clear my opinion on some of the bad uses of Tor.
The folks who are using Tor for child porn, even though they are a tiny
fraction of overall Tor users, are greatly hurting Tor -- by changing
or reinforcing public perceptions of what privacy is for, and also
by attracting the attention and focus of law enforcement and making
that the way that law enforcement first learns about Tor. So, fuck
them, they should get off our network, that's not what Tor is for and
they're hurting all of us. Now, that doesn't mean we should weaken Tor,
even if we don't want them on the network. That slope is too easy to
slip down, and we must not get into the business of dictating what
is acceptable behavior for Tor users (which would eventually lead to
designing technical mechanisms to enforce these choices).
I just went back to re-read the Forbes article, and in retrospect it
sure makes it look like all of these companies are working on tools that
relate to Tor hidden services. They aren't. The main focus for Memex is
on automatically parsing and collecting info from ads on e.g. craigslist,
and generally getting better at the 'big data' side of searching and
organizing this data. More generally, Memex is made up of a bunch of
different companies, each doing their thing. I guess this is another
casualty of the ambiguity of the phrases 'dark web' and 'deep web',
since journalists find them hot to talk about but nobody reliably knows
what they refer to.
If you want to follow along with the actual technical work we're doing,
I invite you to observe or participate in the periodic "SponsorR"
meetings that happen on IRC:

hey Juan,
i'm turning over a new leaf and responding to your feedback with
promptness and detail. [0]
open source code in the open means heavy handed attempts to backdoor
or weaken are visible, and prone to discovery in the future. if you
have a diverse, engaged community of security conscious developers,
the odds of finding such a thing quickly is good, and you're also
going to find the oversights and bugs just as risky to security and
how do you trust the developers themselves? that's a hard question i
have no good answer for. i went to the Paris dev conference last
summer to get first hand view of environment around Tor devs, and meet
digital entities face to face... nation state security services
definitely interested, but seemingly effective without resorting to
exotic narco cartel threats in your vivid imagination.
notice that Tor browser builds are reproducible, and now (some) signed
by hardware token. these are all parts of building trust in the
software that gets distributed and executed by others.
how do you trust, along specific angles, the OPSEC, integrity(verity),
vigilance of a given developer? i don't have answers. one fun
anecdote, however, is trial by DEF CON, back in the day before it sold
out wholesale. not recommended, even then! :P
i trust serqet345qt265xp.onion more gmail, that's for sure. (gmail
nicely expresses my contempt for email, however.)
as for anything else, it's back to trusting trust and where do you
draw the line.  open development cannot force independent, competent
review of code and architecture - a highly demanded service in
industry and elsewhere.
are you contesting the appropriateness of any cooperation with law
enforcement what so ever?
or that education is really some nefarious secret collusion to screw Tor users?
please elaborate on the bla. thank you!

what part of "Will never compromise Tor" do you not understand?
educating law enforcement does not equate to capitulating to calls for
backdoors or weaknesses.
when the control port flaw was disclosed, a patch was committed within
8 hours - while Tor people were on the road at a security conference.
this is a record turn-around for any defect i have been involved with.
in terms of technical measures for security, Tor has a great track
record - even compared to projects with ten times their resources.
Tor _is_ the most effective model deployed. there are a great many
ideas about making it even better, and i don't see how Tor being
popular precludes making it better.
take a look at the datagram Tor related research to see just how
difficult / complicated some of these problems are.
 (userspace stacks, congestion controls, padding and reordering, etc... )
pro-active security posture, prompt resolutions to serious security
issues, attentive to new research and actively engaged with
educational and professional organizations.
any of these aspects speak well of Tor itself and the Tor Project around it.
perhaps disagreement based in technical merit should have been
requested. do you have any?

the claim was not that Tor is immune to flaws. the point is that it
works. it is not systematically broken, otherwise Snowden would have
been neutralized early into tentative discussions with Laura, et. al.
it's also important to note that Tor was only part of Snowden's opsec,
which is a verbose tangent elided here.
citation needed. disclosure was delegated to reporters, as Snowden
himself collected details  that have demonstrated impact on US
interests, given only the reporting to date.
what Tor Project and EFF decisions have you felt abdicated to the government?

Iâm at Princeton where Ed Snowden is due to speak by live video link
in a few minutes, and have a discussion with Bart Gellmann.
Yesterday he spent four hours with a group of cryptographers from
industry and academia, of which I was privileged to be one. The topic
was the possible and likely countermeasures, both legal and technical,
against state surveillance. Ed attended as the âSnobotâ, a
telepresence robot that let him speak to us, listen and move round the
room, from a studio in Moscow. As well as over a dozen cryptographers
there was at least one lawyer and at least one journalist familiar
with the leaked documents. Yesterdayâs meeting was under the Chatham
House rule, so I may not say who said what; any new disclosures may
have been made by Snowden, or by one of the journalists, or by one of
the cryptographers who has assisted journalists with the material.
Although most of what was discussed has probably appeared already in
one place or another, as a matter of prudence Iâm publishing these
notes on the blog while Iâm enjoying US first-amendment rights, and
will sanitise them from my laptop before coming back through UK
The problem of state surveillance is a global one rather than an NSA
issue, and has been growing for years, along with public awareness of
it. But we learned a lot from the leaks; for example, wiretaps on the
communications between data centres were something nobody thought of;
and it might do no harm to think a bit more about the backhaul in
CDNs. (A website that runs TLS to a CDN and then bareback to the main
server is actually worse than nothing, as we lose the ability to shame
them.) Of course the agencies will go for the low-hanging fruit.
Second, we also got some reassurance; for example, TLS works, unless
the agencies have managed to steal or coerce the private keys, or hack
the end systems. (This is a complex discussion given CDNs, problems
with the CA ecology and bugs like Heartbleed.) And itâs a matter of
record that Ed trusted his life to Tor, because he saw from the other
side that it worked.
Third, the leaks give us a clear view of an intelligence analystâs
workflow. She will mainly look in Xkeyscore which is the Google of
5eyes comint; itâs a federated system hoovering up masses of stuff not
just from 5eyes own assets but from other countries where the NSA
cooperates or pays for access. Data are âingestedâ into a vast rolling
buffer; an analyst can run a federated search, using a selector (such
as an IP address) or fingerprint (something that can be matched
against the traffic). There are other such systems: âDancing oasisâ is
the middle eastern version. Some xkeyscore assets are actually
compromised third-party systems; there are multiple cases of rooted
SMS servers that are queried in place and the results exfiltrated.
Others involve vast infrastructure, like Tempora. If data in Xkeyscore
are marked as of interest, theyâs moved to Pinwale to be memorialised
for 5+ years. This is one function of the MDRs (massive data
repositories, now more tactfully renamed mission data repositories)
like Utah. At present storage is behind ingestion. Xkeyscore buffer
times just depend on volumes and what storage they managed to install,
plus what they manage to filter out.
As for crypto capabilities, a lot of stuff is decrypted automatically
on ingest (e.g. using a âstolen certâ, presumably a private key
obtained through hacking). Else the analyst sends the ciphertext to
CES and they either decrypt it or say they canât. Thereâs no evidence
of a âwowâ cryptanalysis; it was key theft, or an implant, or a
predicted RNG or supply-chain interference. Cryptanalysis has been
seen of RC4, but not of elliptic curve crypto, and thereâs no sign of
exploits against other commonly used algorithms. Of course, the
vendors of some products have been coopted, notably skype. Homegrown
crypto is routinely problematic, but properly implemented crypto keeps
the agency out; gpg ciphertexts with RSA 1024 were returned as fails.
With IKE the NSA were interested in getting the original handshakes,
harvesting them all systematically worldwide. These are databased and
indexed. The quantum type attacks were common against non-crypto
traffic; itâs easy to spam a poisoned link. However there is no
evidence at all of active attacks on cryptographic protocols, or of
any break-and-poison attack on crypto links. It is however possible
that the hacking crew can use your cryptography to go after your end
system rather than the content, if for example your crypto software
has a buffer overflow.
What else might we learn from the disclosures when designing and
implementing crypto? Well, read the disclosures and use your brain.
Why did GCHQ bother stealing all the SIM card keys for Iceland from
Gemalto, unless they have access to the local GSM radio links? Just
look at the roof panels on US or UK embassies, that look like concrete
but are actually transparent to RF. So when designing a protocol ask
yourself whether a local listener is a serious consideration.
In addition to the Gemalto case, Belgacom is another case of hacking X
to get at Y. The kind of attack here is now completely routine: you
look for the HR spreadsheet in corporate email traffic, use this to
identify the sysadmins, then chain your way in. Companies need to have
some clue if theyâre to stop attacks like this succeeding almost
trivially. By routinely hacking companies of interest, the agencies
are comprehensively undermining the security of critical
infrastructure, and claim itâs a ânobody but usâ capability. however
thatâs not going to last; other countries will catch up.
Would opportunistic encryption help, such as using unauthenticated
Diffie-Hellman everwhere? Quite probably; but governments might then
simply compel the big service forms to make the seeds predictable. At
present, key theft is probably more common than key compulsion in US
operations (though other countries may be different). If the US
government ever does use compelled certs, itâs more likely to be the
FBI than the NSA, because of the latterâs focus on foreign targets.
The FBI will occasionally buy hacked servers to run in place as
honeypots, but Stuxnet and Flame used stolen certs. Bear in mind that
anyone outside the USA has zero rights under US law.
Is it sensible to use medium-security systems such as Skype to hide
traffic, even though they will give law enforcement access? For
example, an NGO contacting people in one of the Stans might not want
to incriminate them by using cryptography. The problem with this is
that systems like Skype will give access not just to the FBI but to
all sorts of really unsavoury police forces.
FBI operations can be opaque because of the care they take with
parallel construction; the Lavabit case was maybe an example. It could
have been easy to steal the key, but then how would the intercepted
content have been used in court? In practice, there are tons of
convictions made on the basis of cargo manifests, travel plans,
calendars and other such plaintext data about which a suitable story
can be told. The FBI considers it to be good practice to just grab all
traffic data and memorialise it forever.
The NSA is even more cautious than the FBI, and wonât use top exploits
against clueful targets unless it really matters. Intelligence
services are at least aware of the risk of losing a capability, unlike
vanilla law enforcement, who once they have a tool will use it against
absolutely everybody.
Using network intrusion detection against bad actors is very much like
the attack / defence evolution seen in the anti-virus business. A
system called Tutelage uses Xkeyscore infrastructure and matches
network traffic against signatures, just like AV, but it has the same
weaknesses. Script kiddies are easily identifiable from their script
signatures via Xkeyscore, but the real bad actors know how to change
network signatures, just as modern malware uses packers to become
highly polymorphic.
Cooperation with companies on network intrusion detection is tied up
with liability games. DDoS attacks from Iran spooked US banks, which
invited the government in to snoop on their networks, but above all
wanted liability protection.
Usability is critical. Lots of good crypto never got widely adopted as
it was too hard to use; think of PGP. On the other hand, Tails is
horrifically vulnerable to traditional endpoint attacks, but you can
give it as a package to journalists to use so they wonât make so many
mistakes. The source has to think âHow can I protect myself?â which
makes it really hard, especially for a source without a crypto and
security background. You just canât trust random journalists to be
clueful about everything from scripting to airgaps. Come to think of
it, a naive source shouldnât trust their life to securedrop; he should
use gpg before he sends stuff to it but he wonât figure out that itâs
a good idea to suppress key IDs. Engineers who design stuff for
whistleblowers and journalists must be really thoughtful and careful
if they want to ensure their users wonât die when they screw up. The
goal should be that no single error should be fatal, and so long as
their failures arenât compounded the users will stay alive. Bear in
mind that non-roman-language countries use numeric passwords, and
often just 8 digits. And being a target can really change the way you
operate. For example, password managers are great, but not for someone
like Ed, as they put too many of the eggs in one basket. If youâre a
target, create a memory castle, or a token that can be destroyed on
short notice. If youâre a target like Ed, you have to
On the policy front, one of the eye-openers was the scale of
intelligence sharing â itâs not just 5 eyes, but 15 or 35 or even 65
once you count all the countries sharing stuff with the NSA. So how
does governance work? Quite simply, the NSA doesnât care about policy.
Their OGC has 100 lawyers whose job is to âenable the missionâ; to
figure out loopholes or new interpretations of the law that let stuff
get done. How do you restrain this? Could you use courts in other
countries, that have stronger human-rights law? The precedents are not
encouraging. New Zealandâs GCSB was sharing intel with Bangladesh
agencies while the NZ government was investigating them for
human-rights abuses. Ramstein in Germany is involved in all the drone
killings, as fibre is needed to keep latency down low enough for
remote vehicle pilots. The problem is that the intelligence agencies
figure out ways to shield the authorities from culpability, and this
should not happen.
Jurisdiction is a big soft spot. When will CDNs get tapped on the
shoulder by local law enforcement in dodgy countries? Can you lock
stuff out of particular jurisdictions, so your stuff doesnât end up in
Egypt just for load-balancing reasons? Can the NSA force data to be
rehomed in a friendly jurisdiction, e.g. by a light DoS? Then they
ârequestâ stuff from a partner rather than âcollectingâ it.
The spooksâ lawyers play games saying for example that they dumped
content, but if you know IP address and file size you often have it;
and IP address is a good enough pseudonym for most intel / LE use.
They deny that they outsource to do legal arbitrage (e.g. NSA spies on
Brits and GCHQ returns the favour by spying on Americans). Are they
telling the truth? In theory there will be an MOU between NSA and the
partner agency stipulating respect for each othersâ laws, but there
can be caveats, such as a classified version which says âthis is not a
binding legal documentâ. The sad fact is that law and legislators are
losing the capability to hold people in the intelligence world to
account, and also losing the appetite for it.
The deepest problem is that the system architecture that has evolved
in recent years holds masses of information on many people with no
intelligence value, but with vast potential for political abuse.
Traditional law enforcement worked on individualised suspicion;
end-system compromise is better than mass search. Ed is on the record
as leaving to the journalists all decisions about what targeted
attacks to talk about, as many of them are against real bad people,
and as a matter of principle we donât want to stop targeted attacks.
Interference with crypto in academia and industry is longstanding.
People who intern with a clearance get a âlifetime obligationâ when
they go through indoctrination (yes, thatâs what itâs called), and
this includes pre-publication review of anything relevant they write.
The prepublication review board (PRB) at the CIA is notoriously
unresponsive and you have to litigate to write a book. There are also
specific programmes to recruit cryptographers, with a view to having
friendly insiders in companies that might use or deploy crypto.
The export control mechanisms are also used as an early warning
mechanism, to tip off the agency that kit X will be shipped to country
Y on date Z. Then the technicians can insert an implant without anyone
at the exporting company knowing a thing. This is usually much better
than getting stuff Trojanned by the vendor.
Western governments are foolish to think they can develop NOBUS
(no-one but us) technology and press the stop button when things go
wrong, as this might not be true for ever. Stuxnet was highly targeted
and carefully delivered but it ended up in Indonesia too. Developing
countries talk of our first-mover advantage in carbon
industrialisation, and push back when we ask them to burn less coal.
They will make the same security arguments as our governments and use
the same techniques, but without the same standards of care. Bear in
mind, on the equities issue, that attack is way way easier than
defence. So is cyber-war plausible? Politically no, but at the expert
level it might eventually be so. Eventually something scary will
happen, and then infrastructure companies will care more, but itâs
doubtful that anyone will do a sufficiently coordinated attack on
enough diverse plant through different firewalls and so on to pose a
major threat to life.
How can we push back on the poisoning of the crypto/security
community? We have to accept that some people are pro-NSA while others
are pro-humanity. Some researchers do responsible disclosure while
others devise zero-days and sell them to the NSA or Vupen. We can push
back a bit by blocking papers from conferences or otherwise denying
academic credit where researchers prefer cash or patriotism to
responsible disclosure, but that only goes so far. People who can pay
for a new kitchen with their first exploit sale can get very
patriotic; NSA contractors have a higher standard of living than
academics. Itâs best to develop a culture where people with and
without clearances agree that crypto must be open and robust. The
FREAK attack was based on export crypto of the 1990s.
We must also strengthen post-national norms in academia, while in the
software world we need transparency, not just in the sense of open
source but of business relationships too. Open source makes it harder
for security companies to sell different versions of the product to
people we like and people we hate. And the NSA may have thought
dual-EC was OK because they were so close to RSA; a sceptical
purchaser should have observed how many government speakers help them
out at the RSA conference!
Secret laws are pure poison; government lawyers claim authority and
act on it, and we donât know about it. Transparency about what
governments can and canât do is vital.
On the technical front, we canât replace the existing infrastructure,
so it wonât be possible in the short term to give people mobile phones
that canât be tracked. However it is possible to layer new
communications systems on top of what already exists, as with the new
generation of messaging apps that support end-to-end crypto with no
key escrow. As for whether such systems take off on a large enough
scale to make a difference, ultimately it will all be about

As US Marshals director resigns amid scandal, questions mount over
agency's cell phone tracking
Agents instructed to hide StingRay details âto the greatest extent
legally possibleâ
This week, the director of the US Marshals, Stacia Hylton, announced
that she will step down within the year. As reported by The Hill on
Tuesday, Director Hyltonâs resignation follows increased scrutiny
regarding allegations of fiscal mismanagement, cronyism and dubious
surveillance practices.
But unlike Michele Leonhart, who resigned as director of the Drug
Enforcement Administration last month after an awkward hearing over
sexual misconduct by DEA agents, Director Hyltonâs announcement did
not ride the wake of any dramatic findings or even a hearing to review
potential impropriety.
A handful of members of Congress â most vocally Senator Chuck Grassley
of Idaho â have voiced concerns over USMS management and called for
independent investigation by the Justice Departmentâs inspector
general. No findings will be published for several months, at least,
but the USMS director has now announced her resignation even before
results from this new investigation are in.
As Director Hylton winds down her tenure, what few documents we have
regarding surveillance practices by the US Marshals leave many
questions unanswered.
The US Marshals Service has spent millions of dollars on StingRays and
similar devices to track cell phones. Policy directives released by
the agency confirm that its investigators â like their counterparts at
the FBI and other law enforcement agencies â are instructed to go to
lengths to keep details of cell phone trackers out of courtroom
testimony and legal filings.
Over the past year, key details have emerged regarding deployment of
cell site simulators by USMS investigators and deputy marshals. A Wall
Street Journal investigation published last November uncovered a USMS
program that uses airplanes outfitted with cell site simulators in
nationwide fugitive manhunts.
The Justice Department refused to confirm or deny the programâs
existence, but insisted the undertaking was legal.
Last summer, the US Marshals physically removed documents regarding
StingRays used by one Florida police department. Two weeks later, the
ACLU obtained emails indicating that the USMS asked the same agency to
phrase court filings so as to obscure the role cell phone trackers
played in an investigation.
One April 2009 email chain details an agreement among the U.S.
Marshals, an assistant state attorney and local police regarding the
wording of probable cause affidavits (PCA) for a case where a StingRay
was deployed to locate a suspect.
âIn the past, and at the request of the U.S. Marshalls (sic),â Sgt.
Ken Castro of the Sarasota Police Department wrote, âthe investigative
means utilized to locate the suspect have not been revealed so that we
may continue to utilize this technology without the knowledge of the
criminal element.â
âIn reports or depositions,â the sergeant further explained, âwe
simply refer to the assistance as âreceived information from a
confidential source regarding the location of the suspect.ââ
Notably, the US Marshals replied it was unable to locate any
communications with Sarasota police or its Florida regional task force
regarding cell site simulators, despite considerable media coverage
and litigation over the rapid document transfer. The Justice
Department upheld the agencyâs response upon appeal last August.
Forty-one pages of undated policy directives released in February by
USMS in response to a Freedom of Information Act request include
instructions to keep details of StingRays and similar surveillance
tactics out of courtroom filings.
One of the broad directives indicates that the US Marshals must obtain
a pen/trap order from a judge in order to capture âsignaling
informationâ from wireless devices. This information includes numbers
dialed and the signals a cell phone exchanges with nearby network
StingRays and similar cell phone tracking equipment use this
information to triangulate a particular deviceâs location or record
communications activity. To capture the content of communications, US
Marshals must request a âTitle IIIâ or wiretap court order, which
demands a higher evidentiary burden.
The FBI told legislators last year that its new StingRay policy
requires agents to secure a warrant to deploy StingRays, rather than
simply a pen/trap order, except under particular circumstances. The
Justice Department also recently announced that it is reviewing
policies across all of its components, including the US Marshals, when
it comes to cell phone tracking. MuckRock is seeking documents related
to both announcements.
Another USMS directive â entitled âSecurity and Protectionâ â stresses
that surveillance division agents must be kept off the stand, if
possible, and disclosure of techniques minimized âthroughout the
judicial process.â
âIt is imperative that investigators understand,â reads the directive
in part, âthat they must minimize, to the greatest extent legally
possible, any testimony by [surveillance division] personnel or the
disclosure of [surveillance division] techniques throughout the
judicial process.â
âSuch disclosure could significantly impair the future effectiveness
of the technique and jeopardize the safety of ongoing and future
surveillance operations by both the USMS and other investigative
A spokesperson for the US Marshals indicated by email that the
directive is current.
The USMS policy documents do not, however, define what constitutes the
âgreatest extent legally possibleâ or the limits of such efforts.

this detail - separating admin rights for virtual devices from the
run-time user rights of an executing virtual machine becomes quite
important when guest escapes happen.
e.g. ... a 24-byte overflow allows the guest to take control of  the
phys_mem_write function pointer in the PCNetState_st structure, and
this is called when trying to flush the updated transmit frame
descriptor back to the guest. By specifying the content of the second
transmit frame, the attacker therefore gets reliable fully-chosen
control of the host instruction pointer, allowing them to take control
of the host.

not to belabor the point, but the summary presented by Adam is spot on:
... everybody is on board with a combination plan:
 1. work to improve decentralisation (specific technical work already
 underway, and education)
 2. create a plan to increase block-size in a slow fashion to not cause
 system shocks (eg like Jeff is proposing or some better variant)
 3. work on actual algorithmic scaling
 In this way we can have throughput needed for scalability and security
 work to continue.
 As I said you can not scale a O(n^2) broadcast network by changing
 constants, you need algorithmic improvements.
 People are working on them already.  All of those 3 things are being
 actively worked on RIGHT NOW, and in the case of algorithmic scaling
 and improve decentralisation have been worked on for months.
 You may have done one useful thing which is to remind people that
 blocks are only 3x-4x below capacity such that we should look at it.
 But we can not work under duress of haste, nor unilateral ultimatums,
 this is the realm of human action that leads to moral hazard, and
 ironically reminds us of why Satoshi put the quote in the genesis
 block.
time spent joining others on these efforts is time well spent.

to assume old coins can "just be" resolved for all holders in all

non-consensus one at that.
sure; these are very different from a "non-consensus hard-fork"

intentionally trying to divert and betray the contract inherent since
the start - a bitcoin is forever - is more than "just a fork", it's

FBI is NSA's front man for domestic programs. see DITU and how PRISM,

FBI does provide blanket surveillance, although they must launder
information through parallel construction before the surveillance
becomes legally actionable.
to be clear, they inspect nearly everything in-line with "Deep Packet
Inspection" and "semantic analysis" and similar techniques, e.g. Narus
Insight, at the edges rather than centrally. there is an order of
magnitude less capacity for NSANet uplink than what is monitored
through taps. they could not pull a mirror of all traffic if they
wanted to!
then, the selected stuff is collected and stored forever*. the Utah
massive data repository is not full take buffer, but rather
persistence for selected or collected information.

need to act direct. this was the first year DIRNSA ever spoke at DEF

my working theory is that TAO *should not ever* be operating against
US citizens, and their techniques so sensitive that DITU is not
allowed to co-opt their capabilities, either.  from what i observed,
DITU gets the "hand-me-down" sploits after they've been discovered, or
lost effectiveness.
FBI DITU cooperation with NSA SSO is operated under FISA, but this is
primarily fiber taps and PRISM front-doors to corporate data stores.
just to make it abundantly clear: keeping up to date against patched
vulnerabilities is critical, as this window of opportunity to take
advantage is regularly and successfully utilized by these console
why care about the hard stuff, if your lax habits make the easy

@_subject: speaking of Bitcoin ... the july4th split 
sometimes even consensus not enough,
 [ failure at 95% agreement! ]
SPV is a compensating measure that addresses block size without
reifying incompatibilities. however, with drawbacks and risk, as taken
on chin in this one:
Summary: Some miners are currently generating invalid blocks. Almost
all software (besides Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 and later) will accept these
invalid blocks under certain conditions. The paragraphs that follow
explain the cause more throughly.
For several months, an increasing amount of mining hash rate has been
signaling its intent to begin enforcing BIP66 strict DER signatures.
As part of the BIP66 rules, once 950 of the last 1,000 blocks were
version 3 (v3) blocks, all upgraded miners would reject version 2 (v2)
Early morning UTC on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was
reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded
5%) mined an invalid block--as was an expected occurrence.
Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network hash rate
was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV mining), and
built new blocks on top of that invalid block.
Note that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had
explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules. By not
doing so, several large miners have lost over $50,000 dollars worth of
mining income so far.
All software that assumes blocks are valid (because invalid blocks
cost miners money) is at risk of showing transactions as confirmed
when they really aren't. This particularly affects lightweight (SPV)
wallets and software such as old versions of Bitcoin Core which have
been downgraded to SPV-level security by the new BIP66 consensus
The immediate fix, which is well underway as of this writing, is to
get all miners off of SPV mining and back to full validation (at least
temporarily). As this progresses, we will reduce our current
recommendation of waiting 30 extra confirmations to a lower number.

     A DIY Guide for those without the patience to wait for whistleblowers
--[ 1 ]-- Introduction
I'm not writing this to brag about what an 31337 h4x0r I am and what m4d sk1llz
it took to 0wn Gamma. I'm writing this to demystify hacking, to show how simple
it is, and to hopefully inform and inspire you to go out and hack shit. If you
have no experience with programming or hacking, some of the text below might
look like a foreign language. Check the resources section at the end to help you
get started. And trust me, once you've learned the basics you'll realize this
really is easier than filing a FOIA request.
--[ 2 ]-- Staying Safe
This is illegal, so you'll need to take same basic precautions:
1) Make a hidden encrypted volume with Truecrypt 7.1a [0]
2) Inside the encrypted volume install Whonix [1]
3) (Optional) While just having everything go over Tor thanks to Whonix is
   probably sufficient, it's better to not use an internet connection connected
   to your name or address. A cantenna, aircrack, and reaver can come in handy
   here.
[0] [1] As long as you follow common sense like never do anything hacking related
outside of Whonix, never do any of your normal computer usage inside Whonix,
never mention any information about your real life when talking with other
hackers, and never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real
life, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with no fear of being v&.
NOTE: I do NOT recommend actually hacking directly over Tor. While Tor is usable
for some things like web browsing, when it comes to using hacking tools like
nmap, sqlmap, and nikto that are making thousands of requests, they will run
very slowly over Tor. Not to mention that you'll want a public IP address to
receive connect back shells. I recommend using servers you've hacked or a VPS
paid with bitcoin to hack from. That way only the low bandwidth text interface
between you and the server is over Tor. All the commands you're running will
have a nice fast connection to your target.
--[ 3 ]-- Mapping out the target
Basically I just repeatedly use fierce [0], whois lookups on IP addresses and
domain names, and reverse whois lookups to find all IP address space and domain
names associated with an organization.
[0] For an example let's take Blackwater. We start out knowing their homepage is at
academi.com. Running fierce.pl -dns academi.com we find the subdomains:
67.238.84.228   email.academi.com
67.238.84.242   extranet.academi.com
67.238.84.240   mail.academi.com
67.238.84.230   secure.academi.com
67.238.84.227   vault.academi.com
54.243.51.249   Now we do whois lookups and find the homepage of  is hosted on
Amazon Web Service, while the other IPs are in the range:
NetRange:       67.238.84.224 - 67.238.84.255
CIDR:           67.238.84.224/27
CustName:       Blackwater USA
Address:        850 Puddin Ridge Rd
Doing a whois lookup on academi.com reveals it's also registered to the same
address, so we'll use that as a string to search with for the reverse whois
lookups. As far as I know all the actual reverse whois lookup services cost
money, so I just cheat with google:
"850 Puddin Ridge Rd" inurl:ip-address-lookup
"850 Puddin Ridge Rd" inurl:domaintools
Now run fierce.pl -range on the IP ranges you find to lookup dns names, and
fierce.pl -dns on the domain names to find subdomains and IP addresses. Do more
whois lookups and repeat the process until you've found everything.
Also just google the organization and browse around its websites. For example on
academi.com we find links to a careers portal, an online store, and an employee
resources page, so now we have some more:
54.236.143.203  careers.academi.com
67.132.195.12   academiproshop.com
67.238.84.236   te.academi.com
67.238.84.238   property.academi.com
67.238.84.241   teams.academi.com
If you repeat the whois lookups and such you'll find academiproshop.com seems to
not be hosted or maintained by Blackwater, so scratch that off the list of
interesting IPs/domains.
In the case of FinFisher what led me to the vulnerable finsupport.finfisher.com
was simply a whois lookup of finfisher.com which found it registered to the name
"FinFisher GmbH". Googling for:
"FinFisher GmbH" inurl:domaintools
finds gamma-international.de, which redirects to finsupport.finfisher.com
...so now you've got some idea how I map out a target.
This is actually one of the most important parts, as the larger the attack
surface that you are able to map out, the easier it will be to find a hole
somewhere in it.
--[ 4 ]-- Scanning & Exploiting
Scan all the IP ranges you found with nmap to find all services running. Aside
from a standard port scan, scanning for SNMP is underrated.
Now for each service you find running:
1) Is it exposing something it shouldn't? Sometimes companies will have services
running that require no authentication and just assume it's safe because the url
or IP to access it isn't public. Maybe fierce found a git subdomain and you can
go to git.companyname.come/gitweb/ and browse their source code.
2) Is it horribly misconfigured? Maybe they have an ftp server that allows
anonymous read or write access to an important directory. Maybe they have a
database server with a blank admin password (lol stratfor). Maybe their embedded
devices (VOIP boxes, IP Cameras, routers etc) are using the manufacturer's
default password.
3) Is it running an old version of software vulnerable to a public exploit?
Webservers deserve their own category. For any webservers, including ones nmap
will often find running on nonstandard ports, I usually:
1) Browse them. Especially on subdomains that fierce finds which aren't intended
for public viewing like test.company.com or dev.company.com you'll often find
interesting stuff just by looking at them.
2) Run nikto [0]. This will check for things like webserver/.svn/,
webserver/backup/, webserver/phpinfo.php, and a few thousand other common
mistakes and misconfigurations.
3) Identify what software is being used on the website. WhatWeb is useful [1]
4) Depending on what software the website is running, use more specific tools
like wpscan [2], CMS-Explorer [3], and Joomscan [4].
First try that against all services to see if any have a misconfiguration,
publicly known vulnerability, or other easy way in. If not, it's time to move
on to finding a new vulnerability:
5) Custom coded web apps are more fertile ground for bugs than large widely used
projects, so try those first. I use ZAP [5], and some combination of its
automated tests along with manually poking around with the help of its
intercepting proxy.
6) For the non-custom software they're running, get a copy to look at.  If it's
free software you can just download it. If it's proprietary you can usually
pirate it. If it's proprietary and obscure enough that you can't pirate it you
can buy it (lame) or find other sites running the same software using google,
find one that's easier to hack, and get a copy from them.
[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] For finsupport.finfisher.com the process was:
* Start nikto running in the background.
* Visit the website. See nothing but a login page. Quickly check for sqli in the
  login form.
* See if WhatWeb knows anything about what software the site is running.
* WhatWeb doesn't recognize it, so the next question I want answered is if this
  is a custom website by Gamma, or if there are other websites using the same
  software.
* I view the page source to find a URL I can search on (index.php isn't
  exactly unique to this software). I pick Scripts/scripts.js.php, and google:
  allinurl:"Scripts/scripts.js.php"
* I find there's a handful of other sites using the same software, all coded by
  the same small webdesign firm. It looks like each site is custom coded but
  they share a lot of code. So I hack a couple of them to get a collection of
  code written by the webdesign firm.
At this point I can see the news stories that journalists will write to drum
up views: "In a sophisticated, multi-step attack, hackers first compromised a
web design firm in order to acquire confidential data that would aid them in
attacking Gamma Group..."
But it's really quite easy, done almost on autopilot once you get the hang of
it. It took all of a couple minutes to:
* google allinurl:"Scripts/scripts.js.php" and find the other sites
* Notice they're all sql injectable in the first url parameter I try.
* Realize they're running Apache ModSecurity so I need to use sqlmap [0] with
  the option --tamper='tamper/modsecurityversioned.py'
* Acquire the admin login information, login and upload a php shell [1] (the
  check for allowable file extensions was done client side in javascript), and
  download the website's source code.
[0] [1] Looking through the source code they might as well have named it Damn Vulnerable
Web App v2 [0]. It's got sqli, LFI, file upload checks done client side in
javascript, and if you're unauthenticated the admin page just sends you back to
the login page with a Location header, but you can have your intercepting proxy
filter the Location header out and access it just fine.
[0] Heading back over to the finsupport site, the admin /BackOffice/ page returns
403 Forbidden, and I'm having some issues with the LFI, so I switch to using the
sqli (it's nice to have a dozen options to choose from). The other sites by the
web designer all had an injectable print.php, so some quick requests to:
 and 1=1
 and 2=1
reveal that finsupport also has print.php and it is injectable. And it's
database admin! For MySQL this means you can read and write files. It turns out
the site has magicquotes enabled, so I can't use INTO OUTFILE to write files.
But I can use a short script that uses sqlmap --file-read to get the php source
for a URL, and a normal web request to get the HTML, and then finds files
included or required in the php source, and finds php files linked in the HTML,
to recursively download the source to the whole site.
Looking through the source, I see customers can attach a file to their support
tickets, and there's no check on the file extension. So I pick a username and
password out of the customer database, create a support request with a php shell
attached, and I'm in!

Root over 50% of linux servers you encounter in the wild with two easy scripts,
Linux_Exploit_Suggester [0], and unix-privesc-check [1].
[0] [1] finsupport was running the latest version of Debian with no local root exploits,
but unix-privesc-check returned:
WARNING: /etc/cron.hourly/mgmtlicensestatus is run by cron as root. The user
www-data can write to /etc/cron.hourly/mgmtlicensestatus
WARNING: /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer is run by cron as root. The user www-data
can write to /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer
so I add to /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer:
chown root:root /path/to/my_setuid_shell
chmod 04755 /path/to/my_setuid_shell
wait an hour, and ....nothing. Turns out that while the cron process is running
it doesn't seem to be actually running cron jobs. Looking in the webalizer
directory shows it didn't update stats the previous month. Apparently after
updating the timezone cron will sometimes run at the wrong time or sometimes not
run at all and you need to restart cron after changing the timezone. ls -l
stopped recording stats, so that's probably the issue. At any rate, the only
thing this server does is host the website, so I already have access to
everything interesting on it. Root wouldn't get much of anything new, so I move
on to the rest of the network.
--[ 6 ]-- Pivoting
The next step is to look around the local network of the box you hacked.  This
is pretty much the same as the first Scanning & Exploiting step, except that
from behind the firewall many more interesting services will be exposed. A
tarball containing a statically linked copy of nmap and all its scripts that you
can upload and run on any box is very useful for this. The various nfs-* and
especially smb-* scripts nmap has will be extremely useful.
The only interesting thing I could get on finsupport's local network was another
webserver serving up a folder called 'qateam' containing their mobile malware.
--[ 7 ]-- Have Fun
Once you're in their networks, the real fun starts. Just use your imagination.
While I titled this a guide for wannabe whistleblowers, there's no reason to
limit yourself to leaking documents. My original plan was to:
1) Hack Gamma and obtain a copy of the FinSpy server software
2) Find vulnerabilities in FinSpy server.
3) Scan the internet for, and hack, all FinSpy C&C servers.
4) Identify the groups running them.
5) Use the C&C server to upload and run a program on all targets telling them
   who was spying on them.
6) Use the C&C server to uninstall FinFisher on all targets.
7) Join the former C&C servers into a botnet to DDoS Gamma Group.
It was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some
interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to
make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while
mocking them on twitter.
Point your GPUs at FinSpy-PC+Mobile-2012-07-12-Final.zip and crack the password
already so I can move on to step 2!
--[ 8 ]-- Other Methods
The general method I outlined above of scan, find vulnerabilities, and exploit
is just one way to hack, probably better suited to those with a background in
programming. There's no one right way, and any method that works is as good as
any other. The other main ways that I'll state without going into detail are:
1) Exploits in web browers, java, flash, or microsoft office, combined with
emailing employees with a convincing message to get them to open the link or
attachment, or hacking a web site frequented by the employees and adding the
browser/java/flash exploit to that.
This is the method used by most of the government hacking groups, but you don't
need to be a government with millions to spend on 0day research or subscriptions
to FinSploit or VUPEN to pull it off. You can get a quality russian exploit kit
for a couple thousand, and rent access to one for much less. There's also
metasploit browser autopwn, but you'll probably have better luck with no
exploits and a fake flash updater prompt.
2) Taking advantage of the fact that people are nice, trusting, and helpful 95%
of the time.
The infosec industry invented a term to make this sound like some sort of
science: "Social Engineering". This is probably the way to go if you don't know
too much about computers, and it really is all it takes to be a successful
hacker [0].

--[ 10 ]-- Outro
You'll notice some of this sounds exactly like what Gamma is doing. Hacking is a
tool. It's not selling hacking tools that makes Gamma evil. It's who their
customers are targeting and with what purpose that makes them evil. That's not
to say that tools are inherently neutral. Hacking is an offensive tool. In the
same way that guerrilla warfare makes it harder to occupy a country, whenever
it's cheaper to attack than to defend it's harder to maintain illegitimate
authority and inequality. So I wrote this to try to make hacking easier and more
accessible. And I wanted to show that the Gamma Group hack really was nothing
fancy, just standard sqli, and that you do have the ability to go out and take
similar action.

0. "The hacker ethos is wild and anarchic, indifferent to the
trappings of success. Or it was, until the gentrifiers moved in"
  - The hacker hacked
by Brett Scott
The hacker ethos is wild and anarchic, indifferent to the trappings of
success. Or it was, until the gentrifiers moved in
Any large and alienating infrastructure controlled by a technocratic
elite is bound to provoke. In particular, it will nettle those who
want to know how it works, those who like the thrill of transgressing,
and those who value the principle of open access. Take the US
telephone network of the 1960s: a vast array of physical
infrastructure dominated by a monopolistic telecoms corporation called
AT&T. A young Air Force serviceman named John Draper â aka Captain
Crunch â discovered that he could manipulate the rules of
tone-dialling systems by using childrenâs whistles found in Capân
Crunch cereal boxes. By whistling the correct tone into a telephone
handset, he could place free long-distance calls through a chink in
the AT&T armour.
Draper was one of the first phone phreakers, a motley crew of jokers
bent on exploring and exploiting loopholes in the system to gain free
access. Through the eyes of conventional society, such phreakers were
just juvenile pranksters and cheapskates. Yet their actions have since
been incorporated into the folklore of modern hacker culture. Draper
said in a 1995 interview: âI was mostly interested in the curiosity of
how the phone company worked. I had no real desire to go rip them off
and steal phone service.â
But in his book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (1984), the
US journalist Steven Levy went so far as to put up Draper as an avatar
of the âtrue hackerâ spirit. Levy was trying to hone in on principles
that he believed constituted a âhacker ethicâ. One such principle was
the âhands-on imperativeâ:
Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the
systems â about the world â from taking things apart, seeing how they
work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interesting
For all his protestations of innocence, itâs clear that Draperâs
curiosity was essentially subversive. It represented a threat to the
ordered lines of power within the system. The phreakers were trying to
open up information infrastructure, and in doing so they showed a
calculated disregard for the authorities that dominated it.
This spirit has carried through into the modern context of the
internet, which, after all, consists of computers connected to one
another via physical telecommunications infrastructure. The internet
promises open access to information and online assembly for individual
computer owners. At the same time, it serves as a tool for corporate
monopolists and government surveillance. The most widely recognised
examples of modern âhackersâ are therefore groups such as Anonymous
and WikiLeaks. These âcypherpunksâ and crypto-anarchists are internet
natives. They fight â at least in principle â to protect the privacy
of the individual while making power itself as transparent as
Popular now
How yuppies hacked the original hacker ethos
Can we design the ideal city or must it evolve organically?
Why food should join books and music in the cultural canon
This dynamic is not unique to the internet. It plays out in many other
spheres of life. Consider the pranksters who mess with rail operators
by jamming ticket-barrier gates to keep them open for others. They
might not describe themselves as hackers, but they carry an ethic of
disdain towards systems that normally allow little agency on the part
of ordinary individuals. Such hacker-like subcultures do not
necessarily see themselves in political terms. Nevertheless, they
share a common tendency towards a rebellious creativity aimed at
increasing the agency of underdogs.
Unlike the open uprising of the liberation leader, the hacker impulse
expresses itself via a constellation of minor acts of insurrection,
often undertaken by individuals, creatively disguised to deprive
authorities of the opportunity to retaliate. Once youâre attuned to
this, you see hacks everywhere. I see it in capoeira. What is it? A
dance? A fight? It is a hack, one that emerged in colonial Brazil as a
way for slaves to practise a martial art under the guise of dance. As
an approach to rebellion, this echoes the acts of subtle disobedience
described by James Scott in Weapons of the Weak: Everyday forms of
Peasant Resistance (1986).
Hacking, then, looks like a practice with very deep roots â as
primally and originally human as disobedience itself. Which makes it
all the more disturbing that hacking itself appears to have been
Get Aeon straight to your inbox
Daily Weekly
Despite the hive-mind connotations of faceless groups such as
Anonymous, the archetype of âthe hackerâ is essentially that of an
individual attempting to live an empowered and unalienated life. It is
outsider in spirit, seeking empowerment outside the terms set by the
mainstream establishment.
Perhaps itâs unwise to essentialise this figure. A range of quite
different people can think of themselves in those terms, from the
lonely nerd tinkering away on DIY radio in the garage to the
investigative journalist immersed in politicised muckraking. It seems
safe to say, though, that itâs not very hacker-like to aspire to
conventional empowerment, to get a job at a blue-chip company while
reading The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. The hacker
impulse is critical. It defies, for example, corporate ambitions.
In my book The Hereticâs Guide to Global Finance (2013), I used this
figure of the hacker as a model for readers wishing to challenge the
global financial system. The machinery of global capital tends to be
seen as complex, disempowering and alienating. The traditional means
of contesting it is to build groups â such as Occupy Wall Street â to
influence politicians and media to pressure it on your behalf. But
this sets up a familiar dynamic: the earnest activist pitted against
the entrenched interests of the business elite. Each group defines
itself against the other, settling into a stagnant trench warfare. The
individual activists frequently end up demoralised, complaining within
echo-chambers about their inability to impact âthe systemâ. They build
an identity based on a kind of downbeat martyrdom, keeping themselves
afloat through a fetishised solidarity with others in the same

Cyber-utopians believe the web spreads democratic freedom. In
practice, it can serve oppressors as much as the oppressed
I was attracted to the hacker archetype because, unlike the
straightforward activist who defines himself in direct opposition to
existing systems, hackers work obliquely. The hacker is ambiguous,
specialising in deviance from established boundaries, including
ideological battle lines. Itâs a trickster spirit, subversive and hard
to pin down. And, arguably, rather than aiming towards some specific
reformist end, the hacker spirit is a âway of beingâ, an attitude
towards the world.
Take, for example, the urban explorer subculture, chronicled by
Bradley Garrett in Explore Everything: Placehacking the City (2013).
The search for unusual detours â through a sewer system, for example â
is exhilarating because you see things that youâre not supposed to be
interested in. Your curiosity takes you to places where you donât
belong. It thus becomes an assertion of individual defiance of social
norms. The byproduct of such exploration is pragmatic knowledge, the
disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienation â
you see whatâs behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer
to the reality of our social world.
    the hacker modifies the machine to make it self-destruct, or
programmes it to frustrate its owners, or opens its usage to those who
donât own it
This is a useful sensibility to cultivate in the face of systems that
create psychological, political and economic barriers to access. In
the context of a complex system â computer, financial or underground
transit â the political divide is always between well-organised,
active insiders versus diffuse, passive outsiders. Hackers challenge
the binary by seeking access, either by literally âcrackingâ
boundaries â breaking in â or by redefining the lines between those
with permission and those without. We might call this appropriation.
A figure of economic power such as a factory owner builds a machine to
extend control. The activist Luddite might break it in rebellion. But
the hacker explores and then modifies the machine to make it
self-destruct, or programmes it to frustrate the purpose of it owners,
or opens its usage to those who do not own it. The hacker ethic is
therefore a composite. It is not merely exploratory curiosity or
rebellious deviance or creative innovation within incumbent systems.
It emerges from the intersection of all three.
The word âhackerâ came into its own in the age of information
technology (IT) and the personal computer. The subtitle of Levyâs
seminal book â Heroes of the Computer Revolution â immediately
situated hackers as the crusaders of computer geek culture. While some
hacker principles he described were broad â such as âmistrust
authorityâ and âpromote decentralisationâ â others were distinctly
IT-centric. âYou can create art and beauty on a computer,â read one.
âAll information should be free,â declared another.
Ever since, most popular representations of the hacker way have
followed Levyâs lead. Neal Stephensonâs cyberpunk novel Snow Crash
(1992) featured the code-wielding Hiro as the âlast of the freelance
hackersâ. The film Hackers (1995) boasted a youthful crew of
jargon-rapping, keyboard-hammering computer ninjas. The media
stereotype that began to be constructed was of a precocious computer
genius using his technological mastery to control events or battle
others. It remains popular to this day. In the James Bond film Skyfall
(2012), the gadget-master Q is reinvented by the actor Ben Whishaw as
a young hacker with a laptop, controlling lines of code with almost
superhuman efficiency, as if his brain was wired directly into the
    In the hands of a sensationalist media, the ethos of hacking is
conflated with the act of cracking computer security
In a sense, then, computers were the making of the hacker, at least as
a popular cultural image. But they were also its undoing. If the
popular imagination hadnât chained the hacker figure so forcefully to
IT, itâs hard to believe it ever would have been demonised in the way
it has been, or that it could have been so effectively defanged.
Computers, and especially the internet, are a primary means of
subsistence for many. This understandably increases public anxiety at
the bogeyman figure of the criminal âhackerâ, the dastardly villain
who breaches computer security to steal and cause havoc. Never mind
that in âtrueâ hacker culture â as found in hackerspaces, maker-labs
and open-source communities around the world â the mechanical act of
breaking into a computer is just one manifestation of the drive to
explore beyond established boundaries. In the hands of a
sensationalist media, the ethos of hacking is conflated with the act
of cracking computer security. Anyone who does that, regardless of the
underlying ethos, is a âhackerâ. Thus a single manifestation of a
single element of the original spirit gets passed off as the whole.
Through the lens of moral panic, a narrative emerges of hackers as a
class of computer attack-dogs. Their primary characteristics become
aggression and amorality. How to guard against them? How, indeed, to
round out the traditional good-versus-evil narrative? Well, naturally,
with a class of poacher-turned-gamekeepers. And so we find the
construction of âwhite-hatâ hackers, protective and upstanding
computer wizards for the public good.
Here is where the second form of corruption begins to emerge. The
construct of the âgood hackerâ has paid off in unexpected ways,
because in our computerised world we have also seen the emergence of a
huge, aggressively competitive technology industry with a serious
innovation obsession. This is the realm of startups, venture
capitalists, and shiny corporate research and development departments.
And, it is here, in subcultures such as Silicon Valley, that we find a
rebel spirit succumbing to perhaps the only force that could destroy
it: gentrification.
Gentrification is the process by which nebulous threats are pacified
and alchemised into money. A raw form â a rough neighbourhood,
indigenous ritual or edgy behaviour such as parkour (or free running)
â gets stripped of its otherness and repackaged to suit mainstream
sensibilities. The process is repetitive. Desirable, unthreatening
elements of the source culture are isolated, formalised and
emphasised, while the unsettling elements are scrubbed away.
Key to any gentrification process are successive waves of pioneers who
gradually reduce the perceived risk of the form in question. In
property gentrification, this starts with the artists and disenchanted
dropouts from mainstream society who are drawn to marginalised areas.
Despite their countercultural impulses, they always carry with them
traces of the dominant culture, whether it be their skin colour or
their desire for good coffee. This, in turn, creates the seeds for
certain markets to take root. A WiFi coffeeshop appears next to the
Somalian community centre. And that, in turn, sends signals back into
the mainstream that the area is slightly less alien than it used to
If you repeat this cycle enough times, the perceived dangers that keep
the property developers and yuppies away gradually erode. Suddenly,
the tipping point arrives. Through a myriad of individual actions
under no one personâs control, the exotic other suddenly appears
within a safe frame: interesting, exciting and cool, but not
threatening. It becomes open to a carefree voyeurism, like a tiger
being transformed into a zoo animal, and then a picture, and then a
tiger-print dress to wear at cocktail parties. Something feels
âgentrifiedâ when this shallow aesthetic of tiger takes over from the
authentic lived experience of tiger.
This is not just about property. In cosmetics shops on Oxford Street
in London you can find beauty products blazoned with pagan
earth-mother imagery. Why are symbols of earth-worship found within
the citadels of consumerism, printed on products designed to
neutralise and control bodily processes? Theyâve been gentrified.
Pockets of actual paganism do still exist, but in the mainstream such
imagery has been thoroughly cleansed of any subversive context.
At the frontiers of gentrification are entire ways of being â
lifestyles, subcultures and outlooks that carry rebellious impulses.
Rap culture is a case in point: from its ghetto roots, it has crossed
over to become a safe âthing that white people likeâ. Gentrification
is an enabler of doublethink, a means by which people in positions of
relative power can, without contradiction, embrace practices that were
formed in resistance to the very things they themselves represent.
We are currently witnessing the gentrification of hacker culture. The
countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the
preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The
association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with
an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds
tinkering away on websites. But, like all gentrification, the influx
into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected
individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening
elements of hacking over the subversive ones.
Silicon Valley has come to host, on the one hand, a large number of
highly educated tech-savvy people who loosely perceive themselves as
rebels set against existing modes of doing business. On the other
hand, it contains a very large pool of venture capital. The former
group jostle for the investor money by explicitly attempting to build
network monopolies â such as those created by Facebook and Google â
for the purpose of extracting windfall profit for the founders and for
the investors that back them, and perhaps, for the large corporates
who will buy them out.
    the revised definition of the tech startup entrepreneur as a
hacker forms part of an emergent system of Silicon Valley doublethink
In this economic context, curiosity, innovation and iterative
experimentation are ultimate virtues, and this element of the hacker
ethic has proved to be an appealing frame for people to portray their
actions within. Traits such as the drive for individual empowerment
and the appreciation of clever solutions already resemble the traits
of the entrepreneur. In this setting, the hacker attitude of playful
troublemaking can be cast in Schumpeterian terms: success-driven
innovators seeking to âdisruptâ old incumbents within a market in an
elite ârebellionâ.
Thus the emergent tech industryâs definition of âhackingâ as
quirky-but-edgy innovation by optimistic entrepreneurs with a love of
getting things done. Nothing sinister about it: itâs just on-the-fly
problem-solving for profit. This gentrified pitch is not just a cool
personal narrative. Itâs also a useful business construct, helping the
tech industry to distinguish itself from the aggressive squares of
Wall Street, competing for the same pool of new graduates.
Indeed, the revised definition of the tech startup entrepreneur as a
hacker forms part of an emergent system of Silicon Valley doublethink:
individual startups portray themselves as âunderdogsâ while
simultaneously being aware of the enormous power and wealth the tech
industry theyâre a part of wields at a collective level. And so we see
a gradual stripping away of the critical connotations of hacking. Who
said a hacker canât be in a position of power? Google cloaks itself in
a quirky âhackerâ identity, with grown adults playing ping pong on
green AstroTurf in the cafeteria, presiding over the companyâs
overarching agenda of network control.
This doublethink bleeds through into mainstream corporate culture,
with the growing institution of the corporate âhackathonâ. We find
financial giants such as Barclays hosting startup accelerators and
financial technology hackathons at forums such as the FinTech
Innovation Lab in Canary Wharf in London, ostensibly to discover the
âfuture of financeââ¦ or at least the future of payment apps that they
can buy out. In this context, the hacker ethic is hollowed out and
subsumed into the ideology of solutionism, to use a term coined by the
Belarusian-born tech critic Evgeny Morozov. It describes the
tech-industry vision of the world as a series of problems waiting for
(profitable) solutions.
This process of gentrification becomes a war over language. If enough
newcomers with media clout use the hollowed-out version of the term,
its edge grows dull. You end up with a mere affectation, failing to
challenge otherwise conventional aspirations. And before you know it,
an earnest Stanford grad is handing me a business card that says,
without irony: âFounder. Investor. Hacker.â
Any gentrification process inevitably presents two options. Do you
abandon the form, leave it to the yuppies and head to the next wild
frontier? Or do you attempt to break the cycle, deface the
estate-agent signs, and picket outside the wine bar with placards
reading âYuppies Go Homeâ?
The answer to this depends on how much you care. Immigrant
neighbourhoods definitely care enough to mobilise real resistance
movements to gentrification, but who wants to protect the hacker
ethic? For some, the spirit of hacking is stupid and pointless anyway,
an individualistic self-help impulse, not an authentic political
movement. What does it matter if it gets gentrified?
We need to confront an irony here. Gentrification is a pacification
process that takes the wild and puts it in frames. I believe that
hacking is the reverse of that, taking the ordered rules of systems
and making them fluid and wild again. Where gentrification tries to
erect safe fences around things, hacker impulses try to break them
down, or redefine them. These are two countervailing forces within
human society. The gentrification of hacking isâ¦ well, perhaps a
perfect hack.
Explore Aeon

Internet & Communication
Or maybe Iâve romanticised it. Maybe hacking has never existed in some
raw form to be gentrified. Perhaps itâs always been part of the
capitalist commodification processes. Stuff is pulled down and then
reordered. Maybe the hackers â like the disenchanted artists and
hipsters â are just the vanguard charged with identifying the next
profitable investment. Perhaps hacking has always been a contradictory
amalgam that combines desire for the unstable and queer with the
control impulse of the stable and straight. Certainly in mainstream
presentations of hacking â whether the criminal version or the Silicon
Valley version â there is a control fetish: the elite coder or
entrepreneur sitting at a dashboard manipulating the world, doing
mysterious or âawesomeâ things out of reach of the ordinary person.
Iâm going to stake a claim on the word though, and state that the true
hacker spirit does not reside at Google, guided by profit targets. The
hacker impulse should not just be about redesigning products, or
creating âsolutionsâ. A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is
not a hack at all. Itâs just a piece of business innovation.
The un-gentrified spirit of hacking should be a commons accessible to
all. This spirit can be seen in the marginal cracks all around us.
Itâs in the emergent forms of peer production and DIY culture, in
maker-spaces and urban farms. We see it in the expansion of âopenâ
scenes, from open hardware to open biotech, and in the intrigue around
3D printers as a way to extend open-source designs into the realm of
manufacture. In a world with increasingly large and unaccountable
economic institutions, we need these everyday forms of resistance.
Hacking, in my world, is a route to escaping the shackles of the
profit-fetish, not a route to profit.
Go home, yuppies.

i also recall amusingly the "Snowden Assasination" plots full of
absurd vengeance,
"In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American,
I personally would go and kill him myself," a current NSA analyst told
BuzzFeed. "A lot of people share this sentiment."
A former U.S. Special Forces officer told Johnson that he "would love
to put a bullet in his head," adding the assertion that Snowden "is
single handedly the greatest traitor in American history."
Buzzfeed notes that nobody expects the U.S. government to act on such fantasies.
Nevertheless, the hypothetical assassination of the NSA-trained hacker
is quite detailed:
âI think if we had the chance, we would end it very quickly,â [an Army
intelligence officer] said. âJust casually walking on the streets of
Moscow, coming back from buying his groceries. Going back to his flat
and he is casually poked by a passerby. He thinks nothing of it at the
time starts to feel a little woozy and thinks itâs a parasite from the
local water. He goes home very innocently and next thing you know he
dies in the shower.â
 fortunately, Snowden continues unabated...

as expected, this was just a "go away" tactic, and once paid, they
took their time to tell me they must refund, and i must give them an
amount, and then they search, and then they charge me, and then they
search some more, and then they give me the docs.
fuck that! and happy judicial precedent later, i gave this reply:
This is a written response regarding payment for FOIA request 1333239-000.
Please be advised that I am NO LONGER WILLING TO PAY FEES and contest
the notion of my request being "commercial use".
Observe that in August, 2015 D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland
emphasized that web-based publishers are as entitled to waivers as
newspapers, that outlets without a following by a broad swath of the
general public can qualify for waivers and that organizations that
pass analyzed government documents to media outlets can be classified
as members of the news media under the federal public records law.
"There is nothing in the statute that specifies the number of outlets
a requester must have, and surely a newspaper is not disqualified if
it forsakes newsprint for (or never had anything but) a website,"
Garland wrote in an opinion joined by Judges Janice Rogers Brown and
David Sentelle. "There is no indication that Congress meant to
distinguish between those who reach their ultimate audiences directly
and those who partner with others to do so..."
- The results of my FOIA requests have been incorporated into popular
reporting in the technical press and wider media, proving the value of
this information to the public and my ability to ultimately reach the
public audience through partner organizations.
Thank you.

the FBI requests have been informative.
i have observed what i call the "sly close" at work, which i hope to
expand on further.
this involves requesting DoJ-361 documentation for a request,
 "A fix is required to perfect the request."
then the request immediately goes into
 "A no responsive documents response."
when documents are sent / receipt of delivery confirmation provided.
this is anomalous because a proper request goes into "An
acknowledgement letter, stating the request is being processed."
 for some period before reaching a final state.
i will have to sue to get my docs, or force them to bring charges? one
conjecture is that active investigations get sly close, not just past
files with unflattering contents...

The ct, sua sponte, consolidates appl number 05-35289 and 05-35291. A
review of the record demonstrates that, although the 3/10/05 and
3/15/05 notices of appl were not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment, aplts filed timely mtns for ext of time to appl
pursuant to FRAP 4(a)(5), which were contained in the notices of app.
The dc has not ruled on those motions. Accordingly, these appls are
remanded to the dc for the limited purpose of allowing that ct to rule
on aplts' mtns. The dc is requested to serve a copy of its decision on
this ct at its earliest convenience. Br in these appls is stayed
pending further order of this ct. [05-35289, 05-35291] (GR) [Entered:

07/21/2005	  11 	Order filed: A review of the record demonstrates that
this court lacks jurisdiction over appeal no. 05-35291 because the
3/15/05 notice of appeal was not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment...CITE. Consequently, appeal no. 05-35291 is
DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Although the district court also
denied aplt James Bell's motion for ext of time to appeal no.
05-35289, further review of the record reflects that aplt Bell's
appeal was timely filed pursuant to FRAP 4(c) because aplt Bell is
incarcerated and his 3/10/05 noa was recvd by the dc one day after the
deadline prescribed by FRAP 4(a)(1). Consequently, appeal no. 05-35289
shall proceed. A review of this court's docket in appeal no. 05-35289
reflects that the filing and docketing fees for this appeal remain
due. Within 21 days after the filing date of this order, aplt Bell
shall pay to the dc the $255.00 filing and docketing fees for this
appeal and file in this court proof of such payment or file in this
court a motion to proceed ifp. Failure to pay the fees or file a
motion to proceed ifp shall result in the automatic dismissal of the
appeal by the clerk for failure to prosecute. See 9th Cir.R. 42-1. (

this is one approach, "zero knowledge" mixes.
there are interesting research avenues around low latency traffic
analysis resistant techniques. they're more complicated, of course,
and in fact it is this complexity to blame rather than any conspiracy.
effective cover traffic for zero knowledge mix is significant. this is
because to be effective in a traditional mix produces bandwidth
explosion among participants.
i challenge you to show an effective mix protocol without this
bandwidth explosion that also does not introduce a break in guarantee
of anonymity.
wrong. I2P does not provide traffic analysis resistance, nor defense
against active attacker.
wrong.  "way better" way too generous. this is just wrong.
part of the problem is that active attacks and traffic analysis are so
hugely effective. the defense of "adding some torrents" is misguided
wishful thinking.
again, more complicated. not just technical but legal.
Tor research continues. however, solving low latency traffic analysis
resistant anonymity is much harder than just "implement cover
in fact, you need to solve half a dozen hard problems at once,
including how to define an appropriate level of cover traffic over
selected links.

@_subject: Fwd: [qubes-devel] Purism Librem 13 and Qubes 
Actually, this is not the first laptop based on open firmware and
software. Glugglug/Minifree did that quite a bit of time ago with
their Libreboot, even FSF certified. Nobody cares, sadly.
Librem likely will fail too for the same reasons - ideology is not
enough, and they are even worse at it technically-wise.
On the other hand, having a more secure laptop is a tangible benefit.
Without backdoors, with fewer bugs, audited firmware, perhaps even
partially audited hardware.
Maybe even make it easier on the designers, produce a server platform
matching those requirements - there's more of a market.
Google might even get in, as they are known to use a lot of customized
firmware and even hardware. I think they used to support Coreboot
They might have stopped caring about this though.
Having competitive hardware or design is not the same as being a competitor.
Try this argument again when it's actually a competitor to, say, any
iPhone. At least in top 10.
By the way, Fairphone 2 is a nice story for uninformed people, about
on par with Librem.
I approve of their other efforts, but it's nowhere near enough or
close to what's necessary.
The critical component, Qualcomm 801 chipset, will be running a
proprietary microkernel with proprietary RF firmware, proprietary DSP
code and more.
Good luck getting Qualcomm to open that - they are quite hostile to
any of those efforts.
Again, poor choice of an architecture and a very tough nut to crack.
(For instance, Marvell is way more open and much less hostile.)
I wouldn't quite count on it, though they seem to be expanding their
open source drivers effort which bodes somewhat well.
That said, their GPUs still require a few fat, complex firmware blobs
- fortunately Qubes is pretty good at scraping GUI and enforcing
separation thereof.
P.S. If we're talking about pie in the sky designs:
Probably the best design for an OS like Qubes would be to have
separate small CPUs instead of many cores, with separate RAM and
memory controller. Maybe even an integrated GPU each to run OpenGL.
Multiple USB controllers and hubs to simplify hardware redirection.
Multiple small flash drives or even chips. Expensive, power intensive,
hard to cool and large though.
Think a tiny cluster of mostly separate PCs, connected via an
extremely fast bus, such as HyperTransport. NUMA considerations would
be less important here as the CPUs with their associated memory would
be dedicated to a VM and the support exists in both Xen and Linux

@_subject: Re: FOIPA adventures 
less interesting reply, but a more interesting response on my part:
FBI claiming privacy interest to refuse ALL of my FOIA regarding the
Sklyarov / Elcomsoft incident years back:
  this is my first attempt to argue compelling public interest against a
privacy exemption,
 it is as follows;
Please recognize the public interest in this request for responsive
records as follows:
First and foremost, extensive media attention during this period was
generated due to the intersection of "hacking" and "reverse
engineering" combined with the DMCA provisions deeming some
technologies illegal at interest to the information technology
industry as a whole. This reason alone is sufficient and compelling
justification for transparency in a watershed case, however, I shall
Second, this case involved not a US citizen, but a foreign national.
As has recently been scoured in the technical press, Wassenar with its
incumbent BIS obligations has brought discussion of the risks
foreigners face visiting the EU and US, in addition to US citizens
abroad who now find themselves subject to severe technical controls
due to their industry participation. I feel that surely this must
provide beyond sufficient justification for public interest in
documents responsive to this request, yet I shall continue to exhaust
the relevant perspectives in my quiver of inquiry.
Thus thirdly, the conference venue, DEF CON security conference,
itself of notoriety and high esteem in the technical community, was
the operating domain for the closing moves of this investigation. The
logistics and technical considerations for operating in this domain
thus also compounds the public interest in the activity for which the
records responsive to this request have been requested.
Fourthly, and there is a fourthly for sure, the activities undertaken
by the agency were at risk of alienating a talent pool the Bureau has
increasingly courted and pursued for their invaluable skills in
digital forensic analysis, reverse engineering, and information
security. Balancing actions before a critical group who also interacts
frequently with the agency, and from whom the Bureau itself draws
professional talent, amplifies the interest and relevance of this
inquiry, and the need for unrestrained transparency when identifying
documents responsive to this request.
Lastly and finally, yet not to diminish the inherent privacy rights
afforded to all earth humans, inalienable, with justice for all, the
privacy rights which this agency has cited in justification for
limiting the documents responsive to this request, please note that
the privacy exemptions provided by law are specific and limited to
situations where there is a compelling personal privacy interest. The
agency has not provided any compelling privacy interest on behalf of
the fine Mr. Sklyarov, and his foreign status removes the common
privacy concerns of an individual within a domestic community at issue
in responsive documents. It is fully reasonable, per Department of
Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, that the FBI
may provide documents detailing "what they were up to" in this
investigation, without undue burden on the privacy rights of a foreign
citizen briefly visiting to attend a public conference in the United
Please do recognize and acquiescence to the public interest so broadly in view.

there is a second limit here, which is the netflow channel capacity /

capacity, you may become unobservable (via loss) resulting in failure

An SDR can, in theory, capture more information that is just available
to the phone and can do so passively. Many of the same metrics apply
but can be derived from other traffic, e.g., for C1 the presence of
any unencrypted traffic on any channel in countries where traffic is
normally encrypted is a big giveaway.  Passively monitoring traffic
gives a more complete picture. It is, however, a game that a much
smaller number of participants can play because the hardware
requirements are for a suitable SDR rather than just a
Qualcomm-equiped Android phone.

if only one target uses an insecure configuration, it is still

clearly relevant.
not obfuscation; recognition of the defender's disadvantage.
as attacker (NSA) any vulnerability is relevant and potentially actionable.
it does; competence is not universally high and evenly distributed in
intelligence organizations.
the most technically accurate and detailed and informed information is
also the most sensitive, sadly. thus until ECI compartments get
spilled moving beyond the executive summary level presentations
there are techniques for finding bugs in rich attack surface like the
whole of Tor Browser, Tor, Tor Launcher, OS integration of same which
can grant exploit developers a reasonable confidence of finding
exploitable holes.
in a minimal, hardened Tor relay configuration these same techniques
may never find an exploitable vulnerability. it is another order of
magnitude harder, and exploits here require leveling with novel
attacks or techniques, typically.
exploiting foreign servers? sure; but highly sensitive. e.g. TAO CNE.
legal hacks of domestic servers - FISA court would have to approve?
both of these are legitimate restraints, though we may argue about
their effectiveness.

Re: NRO Case Dear Mr. Peck:
This is in response to your request dated 19 September 2015, received
in the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on 21 September 2015. Pursuant
to the Freedom of Information Act, you are requesting "Records associated
with self inspection of classified materials handling pursuant to Executive
Order (E.O.) 13526 and E.O. 13587 for the last ten (10) years."
We have accepted your request, and it is being processed in accordance
with the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 552, as amended. As an interim release in
response to your request, we are providing to you thirty-nine pages of
responsive information that has previously been released in part to another
requester. These pages are being released in part to you, as well.
Information that is denied is withheld pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(3),
which is the basis for withholding information exempt from disclosure by
statute. The relevant withholding statute is 10 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 424, which
provides (except as required by the President or for information provided to
Congress), that no provision of law shall be construed to require the
disclosure of the organization or any function of the NRO; the number of
persons employed by or assigned or detailed to the NRO; or the name or
official title, occupational series, grade, or salary of any such person.
Since it is unlikely we will be able to provide a complete response
within the 20 working days stipulated by the Act, you have the right to
consider this a denial and may appeal on this basis to the NRO Appeal Review
Panel, 14675 Lee Road, Chantilly, VA 20151-1715 after the initial 20 working
day period has elapsed. It would seem more reasonable, however, to allow us
sufficient time to continue processing your request and respond as soon as
we can. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that you agree
and will continue processing your FOIA request on this basis. You will have
the right to appeal any denial of records after you receive a final response
to your request.
The FOIA authorizes federal agencies to assess fees for record
services. Based upon the information provided, you have been placed in the
"other" category of requesters, which means you are responsible for the cost
of search time exceeding two hours ($44.00/hour) and reproduction fees ($.15
per page) exceeding 100 pages. We will notify you if it appears that we will
meet or exceed our $25.00 minimum billing threshold in processing your
request. Additional information about fees can be found on our website at

PART D: A summary of the findings of your agency's self-inspection program
The summary should present specific, concise findings from your
self-inspection program for each of the required program areas below.
It is not a
description of the requirements of the agency's CNSI program. Rather,
the summary outlines the essential self-inspection findings based on
compilation and/or distillation of the information contained in the
agency's internal self-inspection reports, checklists, etc. In large
agencies where
findings are drawn from multiple agency offices and activities, the
findings that are reported here may be the most significant or most
44. Original Classification:
OCAs are senior officers and mainly exercise their authority through
the signing of classification guides for
information unique to their activity. While OCA decisions get
implemented through the classification guide,
written documentation of individual OCA decisions is difficult or
impossible to locate. OCA's were not using
the appropriate OCA classification block but a derivative block. OS&CI
Policy Branch will issue clear
instructions for all classification guides to contain the appropriate
OCA classification block.
45. Derivative Classification:
NRO activities result in complicated Power Point slide briefings with
complex tables, diagrams, and text boxes
describing engineering and R&D activities. Under reduced manning from
sequestration and budget cuts which
have resulted in a loss of over 1,000 man-years of experience across
the NRO, derivative classifiers struggle to
get all derivative markings accurate after they have compiled
difficult subject matter on compressed time lines
under stressful conditions. It is admirable that individuals perform
as well as they do.
46. Declassification:
Not included in self-inspection.
47. Safeguarding:
Regular conduct of exercises provides vital feedback to the physical
security program. Exercises identify areas
for corrective measures, enhancements, validates current tactics
techniques and procedures (TTP) and the
adoption/employment of new TTP to meet a dynamic threat environment.
Regular inspections/audits are
essential to ensuring status and validity of issued IC badges and
conformity to physical security requirements.
Risk assessments/physical security assessments provide a helpful
"outside" perspective to site security offices.
48. Security Violations:
The ISAP program is the formal mechanism by which we corroborate
self-inspections. Included in these formal
reviews is an assessment of the respective security violation program
and trends. In addition, each component
Security team evaluates Security incidents and violations by tracking
them according to general broad categories.
During this past FY, the majority (63%) of incidents/violations were
related to categories within personnel
electronic devices in SCIFs. Other categories that have multiple
occurrences indicating potential trends are data
49. Security Education and Training:
100% of personnel assigned to the NRO are required to complete an SCI
indoctrination briefing to include
signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. E.O. 13526 is called out
specifically so that personnel fully understand
their responsibilities and requirements to protect classified
information. This message is repeated by the release
of awareness videos and reminders throughout the year; to include
presentations, written materials, and training.
Specifically, OS&CI incorporates classification management questions
within the Annual Security Refresher
50. Management and Oversight:
Government oversight of NRO-sponsored SCIFs is achieved in a multi
faceted manner. Program Security
Officers, Physical/Technical, and Computer Security Officers review
self-assessment results and participate in
on-site reviews. Some program findings for FY 13 were identified in
the following areas:
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) require more detail and more
frequent revision to stay up-to-date with
security requirements.

PART E: An assessment of the findings of your agency's self-inspection program
The assessment
discerns what the findings mean. The assessment is an evaluation of
the state of each element of your agency's CNSI program
based on an analysis of the specific, concise findings of the
self-inspection program. It reports what you have determined the
findings indicate about
the state of your agency's CNSI program.
The assessment should inform the SAO and other decision makers of
significant issues that impact the CNSI program. It should be used to
how security programs can be improved, whether the agency regulation
or other policies and procedures must be updated, and if necessary
are committed to the effective implementation of the CNSI program. The
assessment should report trends that were identified during the
period across the agency or in particular activities, as well as
trends detected by making comparisons with earlier reporting periods.
It can be used to
support assertions about the successes and strengths of an agency's program.
51. Original Classification:
While OCA's produce timely and sufficient Classification Guides,
decisions are not normally documented
outside the guide by a separate source document. OCAs are not using an
OCA style classification block but this
will be corrected soon when specific detailed policy is issued by
Security Policy.
52. Derivative Classification:
Derivative classifiers are still wrestling with proper portion marking
and classification of complex power point
slide presentations and other documents concerning difficult subject
matter and formats. To try and stem this
tide, we are adding more classification management questions to our
ASR. Dwindling budgets, reduced
manpower, and "greening" (reducing) of salaries has reduced longevity,
increased turnover, and reduced portion
marking proficiency.
53. Declassification:
Not included in self-inspection.
54. Safeguarding:
Awareness and education programs are vital to ensuring the workforce
maintains awareness of security policy
and procedures. Regular and aperiodic exercises, inspections, and
audits provide crucial inputs that are
indispensable to ensuring that the physical security program is
current and effective. Key challenges are
maintaining adequate funding to replace aging, malfunctioning, and
obsolete security equipment and training and
education for new personnel. The NRO has an organization-level process
for the Assessment and Authorization
55. Security Violations:
The NSM detail the NRO process for reporting and investigating
security incidents, infractions and violations.
Appropriate and prompt corrective actions were taken to mitigate the
severity of the infraction/violation, and to
sanction the offender via management, counterintelligence, and
personnel security processes. Infractions and
violations are centrally tracked in the Security Log (the NRO
incident/violation database). This database is
managed by the Program Security Officers in each directorate and
office, and enables the PSO to automatically
56. Security Education and Training:
OS&CI works closely with PSOs, Counterintelligence personnel, and the
Integrated Self Assessment Program
to determine any trends or specific areas that need an additional
educational awareness campaign. Security
communications are then targeted, utilizing large scale efforts, per a
topic area and audience for best impact
results. The NRO is adding additional classification management
questions to the Annual Security Refresher to
better satisfy the derivative classification training requirement.
OCAs complete yearly training provided by
57. Management and Oversight:
The NRO has a very mature Security management and oversight program.
Over the past FY, much greater
emphasis has been placed on ensuring all sites and facilities
accomplished the self-assessments and submited the
findings to the Government within the mandated time requirements. This
improved management oversight has
made an impact. Our self-inspection program coupled with security
officer visits, and formal team assessments
provide managers a report card on the health of our security programs.
When negative trends are identified,

89. Describe actions that have been taken or are
planned to correct identified program deficiencies, marking
discrepancies, or misclassification
actions, and to deter their reoccurrence.
OS&CI Policy Branch will issue written instructions that all
Classification Guides and original classification
decisions will use an OCA style classification block.
We plan to issue NRO-wide, monthly, short written educational
reminders of the most error-prone mistakes
reported in item 88 which will also include the proper way to classify
and mark materials.
PART I: Best Practices
Best practices are those actions or activities that
make your self-inspection program and/or CNSI program more effective
or efficient. They set your
program apart through innovation or by exceeding the minimum program
requirements. These are practices that may be utilized or emulated by
other agencies.
90. Describe best practices that were identified during the self-inspection.
One contractor site developed a database that allows self-assessments
to be completed by each program area at
that site. The database can apply filtering and reporting
capabilities, thereby allowing managers to focus
resources on a wide-range of security-related disciplines. This type
of approach and comprehensive tool
development had not been previously seen by the ISAP Program.

DOS&CI and are reviewed and updated
annually but not as part of the self-inspection. All directives and
instructions are maintained on-line and are
accessible to all government employees and contractors.
(b)(3) 10 USC 424
Item 27. All government and contractor PSOs and CMOs (about ' '
'ndividuals) are authorized to correct
incorrect classification, incorrect use of SCI control channels, anÃ¢â¬Â¢
incorrect dissemination restrictions.
Item 68. CIA personnel (including CIA contractors with Agency Data
Network or staff-like access) at the NRO
are required to take the CIA "2013 Derivative Classifier Training" by
their parent agency. All other government
and contractors at the NRO take their training through the Annual
Security Refresher briefing.

EO 13526 CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION AND IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE
PART 1. DESCRIPTION OF SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM: A description of the
DoD Components self-
inspection program should include activities assessed, program areas
covered, and methodology
utilized. The description must demonstrate how the self-inspection
program provides the senior
agency official with the information necessary to assess the
effectiveness of the classified national
security information program within the individual Component
activities and the Component as a
whole. It should include the following:
1. Responsibility for the program:
(1) Whom does the senior agency official designate to assist in
directing and administering the self-inspection
Answer . The Director of Security and Counterintelligence (DOS&CI) is
provided a Letter of Instruction by the
Director, NRO which assigns his responsibilities.
(2) How is the program structured to provide the senior agency
official with the information necessary to assess the
agency's classified national security information program?
Answer: The DOS&CI advises the Senior Agency Official (SAO) when the
DOS&CI believes events warrant
advising the SAO. The NRO Integrated Security Assessment Program
(ISAP) results are also reported to the SAO
thru the annual Management Control Plan Statement of Assurance (MCPSOA).
(b)(3) 10 USC 424
(3) Who conducts the self-inspections?
Answer: NRO self-inspections are part of the NRO ISAP. Because
contractors make upgAof the total NRO
workforce and have the overwhelming number of Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facilities (SCIFs), ISAP is
a collaborative process between Government and industry to identifi ,
and address security vulnerabilities, provide
e tmcuriyseand.Th
may lead to identification and
definition of risk mitigation practices, and enable sharing of best
security practices across government and
industry. The primary purpose of the ISAP is to ensure the proper
safeguarding of classified information through a
single comprehensive review by various components of the Office of
Security and Counterintelligence (OS&CI).
ISAP integrates reviews utilizing program security, classification
management, transportation and transmission of
classified information, physical and technical accreditation,
information systems security, personnel security, and
Counterintelligence (CI) perspectives. The integrated assessment
evaluates implementation of and ensures
compliance with, established security policies, procedures, and plans
at all NRO government and contractor
Site personnel conduct/document security self-assessments per
requirements stated in the NRO Security Manual
(NSM). Security Officers will conduct self-assessments of their SCIFs
at least annually. For the reporting period
there were 343 site self-assessments. The ISAP Manager or designee
reviews the site assessments and enters a
copy into an NRO database listing each NRO sponsored facility.
Based on the self-assessments, the ISAP Manager, Program Security
Officers (PSOs) and stakeholders discuss
findings and formulate recommendations for a formal assessment, if
required OS&CI stakeholders represent the
major OS&CI divisions and program office security staffs, including,
but not limited to, PSOs, Physical/Technical
Certification Officers, and Security Certification Officers.
Stakeholders will develop and provide ISAP candidates
to the ISAP Selection Board. Each ISAP recommendation shall contain
detailed factors used to formulate the
recommendation. Recommendation for site visits is then provided to the
selection board Sites are selected based
on ring proximity, resources, budgetary constraints, time since last
assessment, and random sampling. A team
composition is proposed for each site visit and a Lead PSO is selected
The Assessment Team will, at a minimum,
consist of a Government PSO and an OS&Cl/Facilities and Information
Security Division (F&ISD) representative.
Additional team members will be added as needed based on site size,
mission, facility risk, and subject areas being
assessed. An out-briefing is provided to site security site - and
other site senior management identfying security
program successes, observations, and any security "best practices"
discovered during the formal assessment. The
results are then loaded into the facility database that contains
information from all previous visits with any problem
areas or "best practices" noted. A final report requiring corrective
actionsto be taken within 90 days of the date of

report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site is required to
provide follow-up reports of corrective action to
the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90 days until all
corrective actions are complete. The
responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports of corrective
action are loaded into the NRO facilities
database for historical purposes. For the reporting period, 16 formal
team assessments were performed An
additional 9 formal specific-issue reviews were conducted There were
an additional 1,491 visits by OS&CI
stakeholders to contractor SCIFs.
(4) How is the senior agency official involved in the program?
Answer: The DOS&CI keeps the SAO advised of trends and issues
developed by the ISAP. The NRO ISAP results
are also reported to the SAO thru the annual MCPSOA.
2. Approach:
(1) What means and methods are employed in conducting self-inspections?
Answer: For formal assessments, the Assessment Team evaluates
implementation, and ensures compliance with,
established NRO security policies, procedures, and plans.
(2) Are different types of self-inspections conducted? If so, describe
each of them.
Answer: Formal assessments will vary based on the experience of the
lead PSO and the stakeholders with the
facility and items noted in the self-evaluation report as well as the
areas of responsibility of the attending subject
matter experts. However, the objective for all is to identify and
address security vulnerabilities, provide data for
analysis, and identift system security issues and trends.
(3) Do the self-inspections evaluate adherence to the principles and
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its implementing
directive and the effectiveness of agency programs covering:
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Original classification?
Answer: Since Original Classification items only apply to 13
government employees who are Original
Classification Authorities (OCA) at NRO Headquarters, a formal tasking
is sent to Program Security Officers
supporting the OCA to determine the date the OCA received their annual
briefing and the number of original
classification decisions they made during the reporting period.
Experience has shown that not all of the OCAs
make individual OCA decisions every year but most require their
authority to sign classification guides for
their area of responsibility. For the reporting period there, nine OCA
decisions were made.
Derivative classification?
Answer: Included. In NRO Implementing Instructions released on 31 May
2011, derivative classifiers were
instructed to include in the classification block a personal
identification number rather than their name to
protect their identity and association with the NRO. This
"Classification ID (CLID)" number exists in the
NRO Access Database so the specific individual with that number can
always be identyled Employees of other
agencies, who already have an ID number assigned by their parent
agency, will use that number instead
Headquarters NRO derivative classifiers have their PSO available for
questions regarding classification and
marking and to review their derivatively classified documents for
format and accuracy of classffication and
marking. Available on the OS&CI website are the Order, Information
Security Oversight Office (IS00)
Implementing Directive and Marking booklet, videos and documents that
explain the correct way to classify
and mark documents, the Controlled Access Program Coordination Office
(CAPCO) register and manual, over
120 Frequently Asked Questions with answers that are posted about
portion marking a Security Policy hotline
that will answer their questions in real-time, and numerous other
experts who are available to answer their
questions. Once the document is distributed, they face additional
scrutiny from any security or classification
management officer who reads it or from subject matter experts who
point out classification and marking
errors to security officers.
The ISAP team visiting a site will review a sample of derivatively
classified documents to point out errors in
classification and marking, omissions of required information, and to
make suggestions for improvement.
Answer: The NRO has a formal declassification program which restricts
to one office the authority to officially
declassify NRO information and release it to the public, and which is
not included in the self-inspection
program. The results of this program are reported in the SF 311 report
provided to USD(I) in October 2012.
The NRO Declassification Guide (known as the Review and Redaction
Guide) is updated and approved by the

(4) Do the self-inspections include a review of relevant security
directives and instructions, as well as interviews with
producers and users of classified information?
Answer: All directives and instructions are issued by the DOS&Cl and
are reviewed and updated annually. All
directives and instructions are maintained on-line and are accessible
to all government employees and contractors.
(5) Do the self-inspections include reviews of representative samples
of your Component's original and derivative
classification actions?
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Do these reviews encompass all Component activities that generate
classified information?
Answer: There are hundreds of individual activities that can generate
classified information. While the annual
self-assessment questionnaire covers 343 of these activities, the ISAP
formal assessment inspects only a small
percentage of these activities yearly. However, the Program Security
Officers, Contractor Program Security
Officers, and Classification Specialists review hundreds of classified
documents yearly and provide direction to
originators to correct those that are improperly marked.
o How do you identify the activities to which this applies?
Answer: Site personnel conduct/document security self-assessments per
requirements stated in the NSM
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Do the reviews include a sampling of various types of classified
information in document and electronic
o How do you ensure that the materials reviewed provide a
representative sample of the Component's
classified information?
Answer: Documents are selected for review in cooperation with site
personnel who are familiar with the type
of materials produced by the site. However, contractors are not
required to count classified pages produced
because of the additional costs that would be incurred by the NRO, so
the documents reviewed may not be a
representative sample.
o How do you determine that the sample is proportionally sufficient to
enable a credible assessment of your
Component's classified product?
Answer: We do not attempt to do this as it would increase costs to the
NRO (as explained above).
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Who conducts the review of the classified products?
o Are they knowledgeable of the classification and marking
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its
implementing directive?
Answer: Yes
o Do they have access to pertinent security classification guides?
Answer: Yes
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Have appropriate personnel been designated to correct
misclassification actions? If so, identify.
Answer: All Program Security Officers and Classification Managemeni
Specialists are authorized to correct
misclassification, incorrect use of SCI channels, and incorrect
dissemination restrictions.
(1) How frequently are self-inspections conducted?
Answer: Annually.
(2) What factors were considered in establishing this time period?
Answer: Time period is defined in the NSM.

(3) How is the program structured to assess individual Component
activities and the Component as a whole?
Answer: Contractor locations far outnumber government locations in the
NRO. Government locations are
relatively few in number and have professional government security
officers assigned who can monitor
safeguarding and classified information production and correct errors
as they occur. We chose to concentrate on
contractorfacilities which are visited relatively infrequently. The
conditions at contractor locations are not directly
applicable to government locations.
(4) If your Component has any special access programs (SAP), are
self-inspections of the SAP programs conducted
Answer: Most SAPs are reviewed as part of the ISAP program. The ISAP
formal assessment team has PSOs
assigned that are briefed for most SAPs. In addition. the NRO conducts
special annual reviews (in some cases.
semi-annual) of the entire Sensitive Activities portfolio.
Do the self-inspections confirm that the Component head or principal
deputy has reviewed each special access
program annually to determine if it continues to meet the requirements
of E.O. 13526?
Answer: The NRO's entire Sensitive Activities portfolio is reviewed
and briefed annually to the DNI's Senior
Review Group (SRG) who then reports to Congress.
Do the self-inspections determine if officers and employees are aware
of the prohibitions and sanctions for
creating or continuing a special access program contrary to the
requirements of E.O. 13526?
Answer: Yes. In keeping with E.O. 13526, all Sensitive Activities'
compartments that are established
terminated, or transitioned (to another program or lower
classification) require NRO Special Activities
Management Board review and approval, followed by notification to the
DNI's Senior Review
Group/Controlled Access Program Oversight Committee.
5. Reporting:
(1) What format for documenting self-inspections in your Component?
Answer: Self assessments are documented using the self-assessment
review tool in the NSM, Appendix B. For
formal assessments, an out-briefing is provided to site security staff
and other site senior management identi&ing
security program successes, observations, and any security "best
practices" discovered during the formal
assessment. The results are then loaded into the facility database
that contains information from all previous visits
with any problem areas or "best practices" noted A final report
requiring corrective actions to be taken within 90
days of the date of report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site
is required to provide follow-up reports of
corrective action to the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90
days until all corrective actions are
complete. The responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports
of corrective action are loaded into the
NRO facilities database for historical purposes.
(2) Who receives the reports?
Answer: The OS&CI ISAP Manager.
(3) Who compiles/analyzes the reports?
Answer: The ISAP Manager and the responsible PSO analyze the report.
How are the findings analyzed to determine if there are problems of a
systemic nature?
Answer: The ISAP Manager provides to the sponsoring Government Program
Security Officer (GPSO) for review
and subsequent action.
(5) How and when are the results of the self-inspections reported to
the senior agency official?
Answer: The DOS&CI determines when results warrant informing the SAO.
(6) How is it determined if corrective actions are required?
Answer: The GPSO and security stalceholder(s) review.

PART 2. ASSESSMENT & SUMMARY:
The assessment is an evaluation of the state of each element of your componenVs
classified national security information program based on an analysis
of the findings of the selfinspection program. It should consider if
the program element is being effectively implemented in
accordance with the Order and Directive and DoD 5200.01-M. It should
consider whether the
findings indicate that the regulation or other policies or procedures
may need to be updated, and
it should take into account other program information such as the
Standard Form 311, "Agency
Security Classification Management Program Data." If a particular
element does not apply to a
component (e.g., original classification authority) the report should
explain this.

"A perfect example of the perils faced by researchers was provided in
a separate talk at Virus Bulletin by Costin Raiu, director of
Kaspersky Labâs Global Research and Analysis Team. Raiu revealed that
when he was involved in the analysis of Stuxnet a few years ago,
someone broke into his house and left a rubber cube with the message

Long-Term Strategy Needed When Analyzing APTs: Researcher
By Eduard Kovacs on October 07, 2015
Analyzing advanced persistent threats (APTs) is not just about
collecting pieces of information, and companies that focus on APTs
should accept the fact that they have become intelligence brokers.
In a presentation last week at the Virus Bulletin conference in
Prague, Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, senior security researcher in
Kaspersky Labâs Global Research and Analysis Team, detailed the ethics
and perils associated with APT research.
Cyberattacks sponsored by nation states are increasingly investigated
by both startups and well-established security companies. However, it
appears that many firms involved in researching APTs lack long-term
strategy and theyâve failed to consider the repercussions of their
According to Guerrero-Saade, one of the main issues is that companies
and researchers have failed to understand that cyberespionage is a
part of classic espionage, and those analyzing such cyber operations
have failed to accept their role as intelligence brokers.
Intelligence agencies and private security firms involved in the
analysis of cyber espionage campaigns follow similar procedural
methodologies, but there are some noteworthy differences.
In the case of intelligence agencies, they receive a request, they
gather information, analyze it, and deliver it. But before delivering
it, the resulting report is taken through a strategic filtering
process that ensures the well-being of all involved parties.
On the other hand, threat intelligence teams donât necessarily need a
delimiting request in order to begin analyzing a threat actorâs
activities -- an investigation can start from a decontextualized
sample or a vague request for incident response. Researchers collect
malware samples, indicators of compromise, and data on command and
control (C&C) infrastructure, but their analysis is oversimplified,
their strategy for release of the information is often deferred to PR
or sales departments. The resulting reports, which might not contain
any actionable intelligence, are often released to the public in an
effort to attract new customers and boost the companyâs reputation,
but without taking into account the potential consequences,
Guerrero-Saade said.
While intelligence agencies and security researchers follow similar
procedural methodologies, there are major differences in the ethics
and especially the perils they face. The Kaspersky Lab expert has
pointed out that the activities of intelligence agencies are not
considered suspicious by other governmental institutions, the
employees of intelligence agencies enjoy legal protections, and their
work is shielded from political blowback.
In the case of threat intelligence teams, however, researchers donât
benefit from any cover for their actions, they donât enjoy any legal
protections, and the companies they work for can also suffer due to
their actions.
According to Guerrero-Saade, the list of perils faced by researchers
includes subtle pressure, patriotic enlistment, bribery, compromise
and blackmail, legal repercussions, threat to livelihood, threat to
viability of life in the actorâs area of influence, threat of force,
and even elimination. A perfect example of the perils faced by
researchers was provided in a separate talk at Virus Bulletin by
Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Labâs Global Research and Analysis
Team. Raiu revealed that when he was involved in the analysis of
Stuxnet a few years ago, someone broke into his house and left a
rubber cube with the message âtake a breakâ written on it.
In the case of companies, they can face political, financial and
regulatory repercussions, they can end up losing government contracts
and partnerships, and they can become the target of rumors and smear
campaigns if they donât properly evaluate what they disclose and whom
they disclose to.
As for ethical concerns, the lack of malware diversification -- the
fact that the same malware is used against both extremists and less
âmaliciousâ targets such as research institutions -- can cause
researchers to question whether or not they should detect the malware.
More precisely, if the malware is used against a legitimate
organization, then it should be detected to protect such entities. On
the other hand, if the malware is detected, it will also make it
easier for extremists to protect themselves against cyber spying
Another ethical issue is related to the fact that the researcherâs
insight into the operation they are targeting is always superficial.
At first glance, it might appear that the targeted entity is
âinnocent,â such as an academic or a journalist, but in reality they
could be a radical academic or a terrorism-facilitating journalist.
Guerrero-Saade told SecurityWeek in an interview that threat actors
can plant false evidence to throw investigators off track -- these are
known as âblack flagâ operations. One good example is the group known
as âWild Neutronâ or âMorpho,â whose malware contains strings in both
Russian and Romanian.
Guerrero-Saade believes that the best way for threat intelligence
teams to overcome the challenges is to accept their role as
intelligence brokers and put more emphasis on strategy. The expert
believes companies should hire a chief strategic officer or someone
who is in charge of making decisions related to who gets what
information, instead of leaving the task to PR and marketing
Companies should also focus on providing actionable intelligence. One
negative example named by the researcher during his presentation at
Virus Bulletin is a recent report from ThreatConnect and Defense Group
that focuses on linking the APT group known as âNaikonâ to a unit of
the Chinese Peopleâs Liberation Army. The problem, according to
Guerrero-Saade, is that the connection made by researchers in the
report focuses on the analysis of an alleged PLA officerâs personal
postings on social media and provides little actionable intelligence.
The Kaspersky researcher told SecurityWeek that this is equivalent to
âdoxingâ someone you donât like, just like members of the Anonymous
hacktivist movement do when they get uncomfortable with another
âThe current threat intelligence market is in the midst of an identity
crisis. As companies transition from plain IT security to intelligence
production, the relevant methodology of intelligence brokerage must be
embraced in order to stand a chance against the supernatural market
tensions that are the product of meddling with the operations of
diverse intelligence agencies and enraging their respective
governments,â Guerrero-Saade said in a paper accompanying his
presentation at Virus Bulletin.
âThe transition to intelligence brokerage proper is encouraged as a
means of survival for threat intelligence producers facing escalating
geopolitical tensions. By empowering the producers to strategically
control their offerings, these tensions are relieved or entirely
sidestepped and the market can flourish away from the limelight,â the
expert added.

unexpected transition into intelligence brokerage," is available for

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Today we are releasing a new, beta version of Tor Messenger, based on
Instantbird [0], an instant messaging client developed in the Mozilla
* What is it?
Tor Messenger is a cross-platform chat program that aims to be secure by
default and sends all of its traffic over Tor.  It supports a wide variety of
transport networks, including Jabber (XMPP), IRC, Google Talk, Facebook Chat,
Twitter, Yahoo, and others; enables Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging [1]
automatically; and has an easy-to-use graphical user interface localized into
multiple languages.
* What it isn't...
Tor Messenger builds on the networks you are familiar with, so that you can
continue communicating in a way your contacts are willing and able to do. This
has traditionally been in a client-server model, meaning that your metadata
(specifically the relationships between contacts) can be logged by the server.
However, your route to the server will be hidden because you are communicating
over Tor.
We are also excited about systems like Pond [2] and Ricochet [3], which try to
solve this problem, and would encourage you to look at their designs and use
them too.
* Why Instantbird?
We considered a number of messaging clients: Pidgin, Adam Langley's
xmpp-client, and Instantbird. Instantbird was the pragmatic choice -- its
transport protocols are written in a memory-safe language (JavaScript); it has
a graphical user interface and already supports many natural languages; and
it's a XUL application, which means we can leverage both the code (Tor
Launcher) and in-house expertise that the Tor Project has developed working on
Tor Browser with Firefox. It also has an active and vibrant software developer
community that has been very responsive and understanding of our needs. The
main feature it lacked was OTR support, which we have implemented [4] and hope
to upstream to the main Instantbird repository for the benefit of all
Instantbird (and Thunderbird) users.
* Current Status
Today we are releasing a beta version with which we hope to gain both
usability and security related feedback. There have been three previous alpha
releases to the mailing lists that have already helped smooth out some of the
rougher edges.
* Downloads
Linux (32-bit)
    Linux (64-bit)
        OS X
            The sha256sums.txt file containing hashes of the bundles is signed with the
key 0x6887935AB297B391 (fingerprint: 3A0B 3D84 3708 9613 6B84  5E82 6887 935A
B297 B391).
* Instructions
- On Linux, extract the bundle(s) and then run: ./start-tor-messenger.desktop
- On OS X, copy the Tor Messenger application from the disk image to your
  local disk before running it.
On all platforms, Tor Messenger sets the profile folder for
Firefox/Instantbird to the installation directory.
- Note that as a policy, unencrypted one-to-one conversations are not allowed
  and your messages will not be transmitted if the person you are talking with
  does not have an OTR-enabled client. You can disable this option in the
  preferences to allow unencrypted communication but doing so is not
  recommended.
* Source Code
We are doing automated builds [5] of Tor Messenger for all platforms.
The Linux builds are reproducible: anyone who builds Tor Messenger for Linux
should have byte-for-byte identical binaries compared with other builds from a
given source. You can build it yourself [6] and let us know if you encounter
any problems or cannot match our build. The Windows and OS X builds are not
completely reproducible yet but we are working on it [7].
* What's to Come
Our current focus is security, robustness and user experience. We will be
fixing bugs and releasing updates as appropriate, and in the future, we plan
on pairing releases with Mozilla's Extended Support Release (ESR) cycle. We
have some ideas on where to take Tor Messenger but we would like to hear what
you have to say. Some possibilities include:
- Reproducible builds for Windows and OS X (
- Sandboxing (
- Automatic updates (
- Improved Tor support (
- OTR over Twitter DMs (
- Produce (and distribute) internationalized builds (
- Secure multi-party communication (np1sec) [8]
- Encrypted file-transfers
- Usability study
* How To Help
Give it a try and provide feedback, requests, and file bugs [9] (choose the
"Tor Messenger" component). If you are a developer, help us close all our
tickets [10] or help us review our design doc [11]. As always, we are idling
on IRC in  (OFTC) (nicks: arlolra; boklm; sukhe) and subscribed to the
tor-talk/dev mailing lists.
Please note that this release is for users who would like to help us with
testing the product but at the same time who also understand the risks
involved in using beta software.
Thanks and we hope you enjoy Tor Messenger!

Google Open-Sourcing TensorFlow Shows AIâs Future Is Data
When Google open sourced its artificial intelligence engine last
weekâfreely sharing the code with the world at largeâLukas Biewald
didnât see it as a triumph of the free software movement. He saw it as
a triumph of data.
Thatâs how youâd expect him to see it. Heâs the CEO of the San
Francisco startup CrowdFlower, which helps online companies like
Twitter juggle massive amounts of data. But after spending time at the
Stanford AI Lab, he knows artificial intelligence. And his point is a
good one.
'What they're not opening up is their data. They would never do that.'
Lukas Biewald, CrowdFlower
In open sourcing the TensorFlow AI engine, Biewald says, Google showed
that, when it comes to AI, the real value lies not so much in the
software or the algorithms as in the data needed to make it all
smarter. Google is giving away the other stuff, but keeping the data.
âAs companies become more data-driven, they feel more comfortable open
sourcing lots of [software]. They know theyâre sitting on lots of
proprietary data that nobody else has access to,â says Biewald, who
also worked at Yahoo as a search engineer and helped bootstrap a
notable search startup called Powerset, now owned by Microsoft. âWhat
theyâre not opening up is their data. They would never do that.â
Making Machines Smarter
Biewald compares this to IBMâs recent purchase of The Weather Channel,
where Big Blue paid millions largely to acquire data it could use to
feed its AI ambitions. âItâs interesting that while companies are
buying data, theyâre open-sourcing their algorithms,â he says. âItâs
pretty clear where these companiesâ bets are, in terms of what matters
for machine learning.â
TensorFlow, you see, deals in a form of AI called deep learning. With
deep learning, you teach systems to perform tasks such as recognizing
images, identifying spoken words, and even understanding natural
language by feeding data into vast neural networks connected machines
that approximate the web of neurons within the human brain. If you
feed photos of cats into a neural net, you can teach it to recognize
cats. If feed it conversational data, you can teach it to carry on
The algorithms that drive these neural networks arenât new. They date
to the 1980s. Whatâs new is that, thanks to the Internet, their
creators have the processing power and the enormous amounts of data to
make these algorithms viable. To teach a system to recognize a cat,
you need an awful lot of machines and an awful lot of cat photos.
After the rise of cloud computing, in which companies like Amazon and
Microsoft rent access to the vast processing power of the net, we all
have access to a vast arrays of machines. But the richest data sits
inside massive companies like Google and Facebook. Billions of people
use their services, which trade in a rich trove of information, from
text to photos to videos to speech and beyond. Both companies are hard
at work building powerful AI software. But their real competitive edge
comes from having a vast quantity of high quality data they can use to
teach this software to âthinkâ more like a human.
To be sure, Biewald is exaggerating (at least a bit) to make a point.
Though Google has open sourced some very important piece of its AI
engine, itâs keeping other pieces to itself (at least for now). What
also matters in the competitive space is talent. Though the algorithms
that drive this technology are an old thing, they evolve at rapid
pace, moving into more and more areas, and this evolution is driven by
some very smart people.
Thatâs one of the reasons Google open sourced TensorFlow. If people
beyond the company can use its software, Google can more easily bring
talent and ideas into the companyâand its software. It also can
continue to work with people who have left the company. âWe have a lot
of summer interns coming in and they do a lot of interesting research
while they are here at Google,â says Jeff Dean, one of the Google
engineers at the heart of the companyâs AI work. âFor some kinds of
problems, they can basically just take their work and continue
developing it on the open source release of TensorFlow.â
''It's kinda hard for academics and startups to do really meaningful
machine learning work because they don't have access to the same kind
of datasets that a Google or an Apple would have.' Lukas Biewald
But thereâs another reason Google can attract the top deep learning
researchers: its data. The same goes for Facebook and other Internet
giants. In recent years, many of the fieldâs top researchers already
have joined these companies, including University of Toronto professor
Geoff Hinton (now at Google), New York University professor Yann Lecun
(now at Facebook), and Stanford professor Andrew Ng (now at Chinese
search giant Baidu).
As Biedwald points out, you canât necessarily get access to the same
data if youâre an academic. âItâs kinda hard for academics and
startups to do really meaningful machine learning work,â he says,
âbecause they donât have access to the same kind of datasets that a
Google or an Apple would have.â
Yes, Apple generates lots of data too, through services like Siri. But
some feel Apple could be at a disadvantage because, after taking a
more extreme stance on privacy than Google and Facebook, it more
tightly restricts how its engineers can makes use of the data they do
have. Thatâs how important digital information is to this movement.
Ken Forbus, a professor of computer science at Northwestern University
who specializes in AI, believes Apple may have to rely more heavily on
technologies beyond of the deep learning realm because of its stance
on privacy.
There are many ways Apple can work around this, including changing its
privacy policies. Like Google and others, it has acquired its own deep
learning startups, and it has attracted AI talent in other ways. But
one thing is indisputable: The future of AI canât happen without the

you should assume any centralized service will become unusable at any

or en masse.
the only thing i have seen survive the highest level of scrutiny are
bespoke systems communicating only over hidden services with
end-to-end crypto. (and by survive - i mean not immediately pwned -
long term resistance is only through constant evolutionary and radical

thank you! a reasonable summary for certain.
and Jim,
this special ".onion" domain is reserved by Tor, and recently
officially recognized.
when connecting via SocksPort, and requesting connection to a *.onion
host, tor the process handles this hidden service circuit building
internally, and connects the "hidden server" to your client through
this SocksPort connection.
this is why saying "Onions should not resolve" via normal means,

 there is DNSPort and TransPort, which allows transparent proxy of

you can use a rPi to do it, even!

sometimes, you must defeat bad ideas for the good to thrive:
 this is the essence of our age: competition for survival of the fittest.
yet there is a limit to what competition can achieve.
consider that competition can never reach a solution at which full
cooperation will arrive. thus, if competition defines our current age,
which leads to resource exhaustion,
cooperation leads to abundance for all, given sufficient technology,
and a better age above our cruel origins.
this is the great divide:
do we carry on with cruelty?
or do we strive for cooperation?
it is an ideal: a state of society in educated awareness and cohesion,
without centralized authority, working toward a collective best end.
it is globally optimal because there is only cooperation. no
destruction competition.
by definition, the efforts of the losers are "waste".
bingo. the crux!
a globally cooperative society would chose this, because it is best
for all, which is best for you. (and not in a "I'm going to kill you,
to save humanity" triviality sense.)
we're getting at the meat of the argument, which is a system and
technology and society which leverages technology in a productive

selective killing.

Last week, CIA director John O. Brennan became the latest victim of
what's become a popular way to embarrass and harass people on the
internet. A hacker allegedly broke into his AOL account and published
emails and documents found inside, many of them personal and
It's called doxingâsometimes doxxingâfrom the word "documents." It
emerged in the 1990s as a hacker revenge tactic, and has since been as
a tool to harass and intimidate people on the internet. Someone would
threaten a woman with physical harm, or try to incite others to harm
her, and publish her personal information as a way of saying "I know a
lot about youâlike where you live and work." Victims of doxing talk
about the fear that this tactic instills. It's very effective, by
which I mean that it's horrible.
Brennan's doxing was slightly different. Here, the attacker had a more
political motive. He wasn't out to intimidate Brennan; he simply
wanted to embarrass him. His personal papers were dumped
indiscriminately, fodder for an eager press. This doxing was a
political act, and we're seeing this kind of thing more and more.
    Lots of people will have to face the publication of personal
correspondence, documents, and information they would rather be
Last year, the government of North Korea allegedly did this to Sony.
Hackers the FBI believes were working for North Korea broke into the
company's networks, stole a huge amount of corporate data, and
published it. This included unreleased movies, financial information,
company plans, and personal emails. The reputational damage to the
company was enormous; the company estimated the cost at $41 million.
In July, hackers stole and published sensitive documents from the
cyberweapons arms manufacturer Hacking Team. That same month,
different hackers did the same thing to the infidelity website Ashley
Madison. In 2014, hackers broke into the iCloud accounts of over 100
celebrities and published personal photographs, most containing some
nudity. In 2013, Edward Snowden doxed the NSA.
These aren't the first instances of politically motivated doxing, but
there's a clear trend. As people realize what an effective attack this
can be, and how an individual can use the tactic to do considerable
damage to powerful people and institutions, we're going to see a lot
more of it.
On the internet, attack is easier than defense. We're living in a
world where a sufficiently skilled and motivated attacker will
circumvent network security. Even worse, most internet security
assumes it needs to defend against an opportunistic attacker who will
attack the weakest network in order to getâfor exampleâa pile of
credit card numbers. The notion of a targeted attacker, who wants Sony
or Ashley Madison or John Brennan because of what they stand for, is
still new. And it's even harder to defend against.
What this means is that we're going to see more political doxing in
the future, against both people and institutions. It's going to be a
factor in elections. It's going to be a factor in anti-corporate
activism. More people will find their personal information exposed to
the world: politicians, corporate executives, celebrities, divisive
and outspoken individuals.
Of course they won't all be doxed, but some of them will. Some of them
will be doxed directly, like Brennan. Some of them will be inadvertent
victims of a doxing attack aimed at a company where their information
is stored, like those celebrities with iPhone accounts and every
customer of Ashley Madison. Regardless of the method, lots of people
will have to face the publication of personal correspondence,
documents, and information they would rather be private.
In the end, doxing is a tactic that the powerless can effectively use
against the powerful. It can be used for whistleblowing. It can be
used as a vehicle for social change. And it can be used to embarrass,
harass, and intimidate. Its popularity will rise and fall on this
effectiveness, especially in a world where prosecuting the doxers is
so difficult.
There's no good solution for this right now. We all have the right to
privacy, and we should be free from doxing. But we're not, and those
of us who are in the public eye have no choice but to rethink our
online data shadows.

Zerocoin Startup Revives the Dream of Truly Anonymous Money
Bitcoin, despite its reputation as anonymous internet cash, was never
designed for perfectly private payments. For the promise of fully
untraceable money, cryptocurrency fans have been waiting for
Zerocoinâa technology designed to have default uncrackable anonymity.
After years of development, that incognito cryptocash is finally
showing signs of a life, now in the form of a stealthy startup.
Late last week, a company calling itself the Zerocoin Electric Coin
Company published a post on Angel List, a website startups use to
raise funds from private investors. Zerocoinâs new CEO and co-founder,
cryptographer Zooko Wilcox-Hearn, confirms in an email to WIRED that
the company will put into practice the Zerocoin (alternatively known
as Zerocash) design initially created by a team of encryption
researchers at Johns Hopkins in 2013, with the goal of creating a
bitcoin-like currency with the greatest privacy and anonymity
protections that modern mathematics can offer.
âBitcoin is HTTP for money. We are HTTPS,â reads Zerocoinâs Angel List
description, an analogy to the layer of privacy enabled on encrypted
web pages versus the surveillance perils of visiting an unencrypted
In fact, Zerocoinâs privacy advantages over bitcoin could be even more
substantial than that HTTPS comparison implies: Bitcoin transactions
are published on the blockchain, the public record of all bitcoin
payments that serves as the backbone of the bitcoin economy. Any
slip-up that identifies a userâs bitcoin addresses also makes it
possible for anyone to trace all of his or her payments from and to
those addresses. Zerocoinâs blockchain, on the other hand, uses a
cryptographic trick known as a âzero-knowledge proofâ to guarantee
that transactions in the Zerocoin economy arenât fraudulent or forged.
But that zero-knowledge feature means that in contrast to bitcoin,
Zerocoinâs blockchain doesnât reveal anything about the paymentâs
origin, destination, or even the transactionâs amount. (Read the full
paper Zerocoinâs creators presented at the 2014 IEEE Spectrum security
and privacy conference here.)
In other words, Zerocoin will let users spend internet cash with
theoretically perfect anonymity. But Zerocoinâs new Angelâs List page
also notes that if necessary, the same zero-knowledge proof trick can
also allow a zerocoin user to forego that privacy and choose to reveal
proof that any individual transaction was his or hersâsay, as a
receipt for some zerocoin purchase. âWe are adding *selective
disclosure* to Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies,â the Angelâs List
page reads. âTransaction metadata in the Blockchain is confidential by
default but can be disclosed to specific parties. This allows the best
of both worlds: both strong privacy and transparency on the
Just how Zerocoin will make money as a startup, however, is far from
clear. For now, Wilcox-Hearn declined to answer any of WIREDâs
questions about how the company will function, when it will officially
launch, or how it plans to put its new cryptocurrency into
Like any bitcoin alternative, Zerocoin will no doubt face stiff
competition from bitcoin itself, which already has buy-in from
millions of users and an exchange rate thatâs appreciated sharply in
just the last week. Even so, a roster of influential angel investors
have already invested $715,000 in Zerocoin, according to Wilcox-Hearn.
Two early backers listed on the Angelâs List posting are Naval
Ravikant, an investor in Twitter and Uber, and Barry Silbert, the
founder of startup equity trading platform SecondMarket. Another is
Roger Ver, a staunchly libertarian bitcoin mogul whoâs made
investments in startups like Blockchain.info and Bitpay, and who used
his substantial crypto-fortune to bankroll much of the criminal
defense of now-convicted Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht.
Zerocoin also cites an impressive collection of âadvisorsâ on its
Angelâs List page. In addition to the academic team that designed
Zerocoin, led by Johns Hopkins computer science professor Matthew
Green, those advisors also include Vitalik Buterin, the founder of
buzzy cryptocurrency startup Ethereum, and Gavin Andresen, one of the
first bitcoin coders and the chief scientist of the Bitcoin
Foundation. The companyâs CEO, Zooko Wilcox-Hearn, has crypto cred of
his own: Heâs the creator of the Tahoe Least Authority File Store, or
Tahoe LAFS, a decentralized, encrypted file storage system.
Even with those supporters, Zerocoin is sure to face criticism and
even legal trouble because of the very privacy properties that make it
unique: A cryptographically untraceable, anonymous currency could
offer massive potential for money laundering and black market sales.
The Silk Roadâs federal prosecutors, after all, proved how valuable a
tougher-to-track cryptocurrency would be to criminals, when they
traced $13.4 million worth of bitcoin from the drug-selling site to
its creator Ross Ulbrichtâs laptop.
Zerocoinâs creators attempted to answer that concern in their online
FAQ, pointing out that criminals can already make anonymous
transactions with cash, or even with bitcoin if theyâre careful to use
âmixingâ services like Dark Wallet or Bitcoin Fog that are designed to
anonymize transactions. âThe introduction of yet another method to
anonymously move money is of little consequence,â they write. But cash
canât be spent online, and mixing services only make tracing payments
more difficultâthey donât render it impossible, as Zerocoinâs
zero-knowledge proofs are designed to do.
More convincingly, the Zerocoin authors also argue the opposite point:
that the alternative to their cryptocurrency is to rely on bitcoin,
whose blockchain can create real problems for any user seeking to keep
his or her transactions private. âWould you want to publish your bank
statement for everyone to see? Of course not: your bank statement can
revealâ¦intimate details about your life,â they write. âFor example,
your payments to a psychiatrist could reveal that you have a mental
health issue.â
Zerocoinâs coming launch as a startup, by contrast, revives the
cryptocurrency communityâs dream of truly anonymous moneyâwith all the
promises and perils that come with it. Stay tuned.

No GSM test network at 32C3
Harald Welte
I currently don't assume that there will be a GSM network at the 32C3.
Ever since OpenBSC was created in 2008, the annual CCC congress was a
great opportunity to test OpenBSC and related software with thousands
of willing participants. In order to do so, we obtained a test licence
from the German regulatory authority. This was never any problem, as
there was a chunk of spectrum in the 1800 MHz GSM band that was not
allocated to any commercial operator, the so-called DECT guard band.
It's called that way as it was kept free in order to ensure there is
no interference between 1800 MHz GSM and the neighboring DECT cordless
Over the decades, it was determined on a EU level that this guard band
might not be necessary, or at least not if certain considerations are
taken for BTSs deployed in that band.
When the German regulatory authority re-auctioned the GSM spectrum
earlier this year, they decided to also auction the frequencies of the
former DECT guard band. The DECT guard band was awarded to Vodafone.
This is a pity, as this means that people involved with cellular
research or development of cellular technology now have it
significantly harder to actually test their systems.
In some other EU member states it is easier, like in the Netherlands
or the UK, where the DECT guard band was not treated like any other
chunk of the GSM bands, but put under special rules. Not so in
To make a long story short: Without the explicit permission of any of
the commercial mobile operators, it is not possible to run a
test/experimental network like we used to ran at the annual CCC
Given that
    the event is held in the city center (where frequencies are
typically used and re-used quite densely), and
    an operator has nothing to gain from permitting us to test our
open source GSM/GPRS implementations,
I think there is little chance that this will become a reality.
If anyone has really good contacts to the radio network planning team
of a German mobile operator and wants to prove me wrong: Feel free to
contact me by e-mail.
Thanks to everyone involved with the GSM team at the CCC events,
particularly Holger Freyther, Daniel Willmann, Stefan Schmidt, Jan
Luebbe, Peter Stuge, Sylvain Munaut, Kevin Redon, Andreas Eversberg,
Ulli (and everyone else whom I may have forgot, my apologies). It's
been a pleasure!
Thanks also to our friends at the POC (Phone Operation Center) who
have provided interfacing to the DECT, ISDN, analog and VoIP network
at the events. Thanks to roh for helping with our special patch
requests. Thanks also to those entities and people who borrowed
equipment (like BTSs) in the pre-sysmocom years.
So long, and thanks for all the fish!

We believe the vulnerabilities and measurability limitations of onion
routing  may  stem  from  an  attempt  to achieve  an  impossible set
of goals and to defend an ultimately indefensible position.
Current tools offer a general-purpose, unconstrained, and individualistic
form of  anonymous  Internet  access.   However,  there are many ways
for unconstrained, individualistic uses of the Internet to be
fingerprinted and tied to individual users.  We suspect that the only
way to achieve measurable and provable levels of anonymity, and to
stake out a position defensible in the long term, is to develop more
collective anonymity protocols and tools.
It may be necessary to constrain the normally individualistic
behaviors of participating nodes, the expectations of users, and
possibly the set of applications
and usage models to which these protocols and tools apply.
Toward this end, we offer a high-level view of the Dissent project, a
âclean-slateâ effort to build practical anonymity systems embodying a
collective model for anonymous  communication.

UPDATE OF PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY ACTION DOCUMENTS
This paper outlines the combined efforts of OGC and NSIR to review and make
recommendations for update of the Presidential Emergency Action
Documents (PEADs).
There are 48 PEADs, which are currently being reviewed and updated on
a government-wide
basis. The review and update process is being managed by the
Department of Justice
(DOJ), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the National Security
Council (NSC).
The NRC's input to the PEAD review and update process is due to DOJ
and FEMA on July
30, 2004. This paper requests Commission approval to transmit the
attached inputs
(Attachment 2) to DOJ and FEMA on that date.
I. Background
The PEADs
The PEADs are pre-coordinated legal documents designed to implement Presidential
decisions during a national emergency. The PEADs consist of
proclamations, executive
orders, Presidential messages, and draft legislation ready for
submission to Congress.
Originally designed for use in the event of any major attack against
the United States that
disrupted the normal functions of the government, PEADs are used to implement
extraordinary Presidential authority in response to extraordinary situations.

The PEADs are useful tools in the case of an emergency because they
are flexible, may be
quickly executed, and are capable of rapid distribution and
implementation. PEADs reduce
the normal amount of time required to promulgate and implement such Presidential
documents by being prepared in advance of an emergency. They are
divided into seven
categories according to their subject matter, and designate
departments or agencies that
would have primary or support responsibility should the PEAD be executed.
Under the PEAD system, primary responsibility is designated to an
agency recommending
the execution of the PEAD, or one of the main agencies responsible for
its implementation.
Support responsibility is designated to an agency that has either been
assigned direct
involvement in carrying out one or more provisions of a PEAD, or an
agency that would be
directly impacted by the carrying out of a PEAD.
The PEAD Update and Revision Project
The current PEAD portfolio was created in 1989 and contains 48 PEAOs.
The first meeting
to discuss the PEAD update and revision project took place on April
22, 2004. The NRC was
not invited to this meeting, nor was the NRC specifically invited to
review the PEAD portfolio.
According to FEMA, the NRC was not asked to participate in the review
because the NRC is
not listed as a primary or support agency in any PEAD.
NSIR staff did not learn until June 2004 that the PEAD review was
underway. NSIR staff
subsequently contacted FEMA and requested copies of the PEADs and
guidance on how to
participate in the review process. NSIR staff did not receive this
information until late June.
The PEAD review and update process calls on all federal departments
and agencies to
review existing PEADs and develop any new PEADs within their
jurisdiction. FEMA serves
as the Executive Secretariat to facilitate the review and update
process, while DOJ
determines the legal sufficiency of any proposed changes or additions
to the PEADs. The
NSC provides overall policy direction for the effort, and will serve
as the final approval
authority for any recommended PEAD changes.
There were three main steps to the OGC/NSIR PEAD review and update
process. First,
OGC and NSIR jointly reviewed existing PEADs to determine their
potential impact on the
NRC, its licensees, and the energy sector in general. Second, NSIR
developed a list of
potential NRC security concerns during a national emergency that might
be addressed
through the PEAD mechanism, and researched whether those concerns are
currently being
addressed outside the PEAD framework. Finally, OGC researched the
legal basis for
existing PEADs, as well as recently enacted legislation, to determine
whether there is any
statutory basis to justify the proposal of a new or amended PEAD to
address NSIR's
concerns. On the basis of our review, OGC recommends one minor change to the
comments on an existing PEAD.

II. Analysis of Existing PEADs
As mentioned above, the PEADs are organized by seven broad categories:
Only category D contains PEADs that, if executed, might directly
impact the operations of
NRG-licensed facilities. These PEADs, D-201 and D-301, are discussed
in some detail
below. PEADs in cate ories A, F, and G mi ht indirect! affect NRC
licensees-for example,
PEADs in categories B
and are not likely to impact NRC operations or NRC-licensed activities
and are not
discussed here.
We turn now to a discussion of specific PEADs of greatest interest to the NRC.

Ill. Analysis of Recently Enacted Legislation and Consideration of New PEADs
As stated above, NSIR provided OGC with a list of potential areas of
NRC concern during a
national emergency that might be remedied by creation of a new PEAD
(Attachment 1 ). In
addition to analyzing existing PEADs to determine whether they could
be used to address
NSIR's concerns, OGC analyzed recently enacted legislation to
determine whether any new
Presidential emergency powers have been established that might be
incorporated into the
PEADs. Specifically, OGC examined the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Homeland
Security Act of 2002 to determine whether Congress has provided the
President with any
emergency powers that might support new PEADs germane to the NRC's
mission and/or
responsive to NSIR's concerns.
The Homeland Security Act, though sweeping in its reorganization of
federal agencies, did
not significantly expand the emergency powers of the President. Most,
if not all, Presidential
powers established by the Act relate to appointments, transfers and
designations of officials
responsible for executing the Act. The Act does establish some
substantive Presidential
authority-for example, the President is directed to prescribe
government-wide policies and
ÃÂ· procedures for sharing and protecting homeland security
information. But this authority is
apparently exercised through normal policymaking channels on a
continuing basis and would
not require a PEAD for emergency implementation.
The USA PATRIOT Act includes a wide range of provisions aimed at
improving investigative
tools in the fight against terrorism. These provisions largely apply
to the day-to-day functions
of law-enforcement agencies. The Act also expands the President's
authority to confiscate
property of foreign entities that engage in armed hostilities against
the United States.
Although seizure of property would disrupt terrorist organization over
time, it would not likely
address pressing social, economic, military, or political issues
during or after a national
emergency. Therefore, there appears to be no need for this
Presidential authority to be
implemented through the PEAD mechanism. It is also unclear how a PEAD
related to the
President's powers under the USA PATRIOT Act would relate to NRC's mission.
Ultimately, OGC discovered no new statutory authority that might be
used to support
development of new PEADs germane to NRC's mission or that would
address the areas of
concern identified by NSIR (Attachment 1).

ATTACHMENT 1
NSIR AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONCERN DURING NATIONAL EMERGENCIES
As part of the PEAD review and update process, NSIR staff posed a
number of scenarios
that might arise during a national emergency and asked whether any
PEADs should be
changed or added to address those scenarios. NSIR (in consultation
with other offices) also
considered whether existing authorities outside the PEAD framework
cold be used to address
its concerns. OGC then analyzed existing PEADs and recent legislation
to determine
whether any of NSIR's concerns should be addressed through PEAD
changes. Ultimately,
OGC recommends no substantive changes to the PEADs because NSIR's concerns can
either be addressed using existing PEADs, or are better addressed through other
decisionmaking processes.
NSIR Concerns Addressed by Existing PEADs
In the event of a national emergency, the President should not have to
wait for a state
governor to request assistance under the Stafford Act or to engage the National
Response Plan. Should a PEAD be developed that would allow the President to act
Under 42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 5191 (b), the President may engage the Stafford Act without a
request from a state governor by declaring that an emergency exists
for which the
primary responsibility for response rests with the United States because the
emergency involves a ÃÂ·subject area for which, under the Constitution
or laws of the
United States, the United States exercises exclusive or preeminent
responsibility and
authority. The National Response Plan would be used to implement the
Stafford Act
in these circumstances.
GC will recommend
make this explicit.
Situations may arise where security at critical nuclear facilities
needs to be supplemented
with armed forces. Should the President be able to direct the use of
National Guard units
or military reserves for this purpose using a PEAD?
Situations may arise where specific goods or services are needed to
respond to a nuclear
incident. For example, priority diagnosis and treatment for essential
nuclear power plant
personnel exposed to a range of chem-bio-rad hazards may be needed.

In the scenario posed by NSIR,
the Department of Health and Human Services, which has been delegated authority
to act under the DPA by Executive Order 12,919, would be em owered
Other NSIR Concerns for Which No PEAD Changes
are Needed
1. Situations may arise where a need for power requires continued
nuclear power plant
operation in violation of federal environmental laws or under degraded
safety conditions.
Would a PEAD authorizing such operation be useful? ÃÂ·
OGC does not recommend the development of a PEAD that could be used to order
operation of nuclear power plants under degraded safety conditions. Enforcement
discretion could be exercised by federal authorities (including the
NRC) to allow
continued operation even though not all safety and environmental
requirements are
being met. Specific decisions should be made by the agencies expert in
the relevant
field. PEADs are not used to make these detailed, technical judgments.
2. Terrorist attacks may cause radioactive material shipments to be
rerouted through states
that object. Is a PEAD necessary to resolve those objections?
The Department of Transportation currently has the authority to route
shipments over
a state's objection, so a PEAD is not needed. DOT regulations adopted under the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975, as amended, would preempt state
efforts to block emergency rerouting of radioactive material shipments. See 49
U.S.C. ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 5101-5127; 49 C.F.R. ÃÂ§ 397.101.
3. The NRC may need to take control of certain radioactive materials
because of increased
threats, weakened security, or other reasons that increase the risk to
the public. Is a
PEAD necessary for this purpose?
SECRET DECLASSIFIED
3
SECRET DECLASSIFIED
Under AEA sections 1OB and 186.c, the Commission has authority to order the
recapture of special nuclear material if a license is revoked or if
Congress declares a
national emergency.
The Commission also has broad authority under the AEA to take actions to protect
public health and safety and promote the common defense and security. This
authority can be invoked to ensure protection of material by mandating
measures or transfer of material to an authorized recipient. The NRC also has a
standing agreement with DOE to take radioactive materials when
necessary to protect
the public.
4. It may become critical and urgent that the NRC participate more
directly in assessing a
threat or in sharing threat information than is normally allowed.
Should a PEAD ordering
enhanced information sharing be written to meet the NRC's needs?
Information sharing and intelligence coordination continues to be a
high priority in the
daily operations of the federal government. In a national emergency, OGC expects
that those efforts would be further enhanced as observed in the response to the
attacks of September 11, 2001 .. Improvements to information and
intelligence sharing
should continue to be pursued through the Department of Homeland Security and
existing intelligence groups with which NRC has working contacts.
5. Nuclear power plant workers may refuse to work due to terrorist
threats against the plant
or a spreading outbreak of communicable disease or virus. Should a PEAD be
developed to address this possibility?
If a nuclear plant does not have enough willing workers to operate
safely, it would
have to be shut down. There is no legal authority that could be used
to force nuclear
power plant employees to work.

proposed in Congress but never passed).
Furthermore, the RG said, there were many in the agency who thought
that publishing such papers was inevitable and harmless; he himself
held this view. There were also some who believed that this kind of
publication might cause them real problems. He recalled the good old
days when public and academic interest in cryptography was confined to
newspaper puzzles. He got a bit more specific about two things: the
agency didn't particularly care about the M-209. What they did care
about was that the method that Reeds had discovered was applicable to
systems that were in current use by particular governments, and that
even though it was hard to imagine that these people would find the
paper and relate it to their own operations (which used

exercise discretion? It was certainly legal to publish, but
publication might cause difficulties for some people in the agency.

I reject and demand appeal of your rejection of this request.
First and foremost, please recognize that the GSF Explorer, formerly
USNS Hughes Glomar Explorer (T-AG-193), for which this Glomar response
is so named, was a purely military operation, using custom-built
military equipment, on an exceptionally sensitive military mission to
recover military equipment. Observe that the "Vulnerabilities Equities
Process" is a public outreach activity communicating with third party
partners, acting in the public interest regarding software used by
public citizens and business alike - a scenario at opposite ends and
means from which this denial blindly overreaches.
Second, observe that existing precedent supports the release of
materials responsive to this request. In American Civil Liberties
Union v. Department of Defense Case No: 04-CV-4151 (ACLU v. DoD) the
courts have affirmed the public interest as compelling argument for
favoring the public interest against clearly military efforts. The
Glomar denial should be well targeted; this targeted falls well
outside of the the "Vulnerabilities Equities Process", which is a
public outreach activity communicating with third party partners,
acting in the public interest, regarding software used by public
citizens and business alike.
Third, consider that it is a well established technique in the
information security industry to identify the origin and nature of a
defect discovery and disclosure timeline. This information is used for
myriad of secondary research, analysis, and automation efforts
spanning numerous industries. The utility of of disclosure timeline
information and context has decades of rich support and strong
evidence of public interest benefit, particularly regarding long
reported and fixed defects, such as this one, which has patches
available for over a year.
Fourth, observe that every hour of expert opinion coupled with legal
review amounts to a non-trivial expenditure of hours which are a sunk,
throw away cost of FOIA communication. While as a taxpayer I
appreciate the service of FOIA professionals such as those involved in
this request, who provide tireless effort the all hundreds of millions
of US citizens, my personal cost should be recognized. For this reason
a deference in favor of public interest and disclosure is well
supported for this request regarding the "Vulnerabilities Equities

by public citizens and business alike.

Source code authorship attribution is a significant privacy threat to
anonymous code contributors. However,
it may also enable attribution of successful attacks from
code left behind on an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright,
copyleft, and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. In this
work, we investigate machine
learning methods to de-anonymize source code authors
of C/C++ using coding style. Our Code Stylometry Feature Set is a
novel representation of coding style found
in source code that reflects coding style from properties
derived from abstract syntax trees.
Our random forest and abstract syntax tree-based approach attributes
more authors (1,600 and 250) with significantly higher accuracy (94%
and 98%) on a larger
data set (Google Code Jam) than has been previously
achieved. Furthermore, these novel features are robust,
difficult to obfuscate, and can be used in other programming
languages, such as Python. We also find that (i) the
code resulting from difficult programming tasks is easier
to attribute than easier tasks and (ii) skilled programmers
(who can complete the more difficult tasks) are easier to
attribute than less skilled programmers.
Do programmers leave fingerprints in their source code?
That is, does each programmer have a distinctive Ã¢â¬Åcoding styleÃ¢â¬Â?
Perhaps a programmer has a preference for
spaces over tabs, or while loops over for loops, or,
more subtly, modular rather than monolithic code.
These questions have strong privacy and security implications.
Contributors to open-source projects may
hide their identity whether they are BitcoinÃ¢â¬â¢s creator or
just a programmer who does not want her employer to
know about her side activities. They may live in a regime
that prohibits certain types of software, such as censorship
circumvention tools. For example, an Iranian pro-
grammer was sentenced to death in 2012 for developing
photo sharing software that was used on pornographic
websites [31].
The flip side of this scenario is that code attribution
may be helpful in a forensic context, such as detection of
ghostwriting, a form of plagiarism, and investigation of
copyright disputes. It might also give us clues about the
identity of malware authors. A careful adversary may
only leave binaries, but others may leave behind code
written in a scripting language or source code downloaded into the
breached system for compilation.
While this problem has been studied previously, our
work represents a qualitative advance over the state of the
art by showing that Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) carry
authorial Ã¢â¬Ëfingerprints.Ã¢â¬â¢ The highest accuracy achieved
in the literature is 97%, but this is achieved on a set of
only 30 programmers and furthermore relies on using
programmer comments and larger amounts of training
data [12, 14]. We match this accuracy on small programmer sets without
this limitation. The largest scale experiments in the literature use
46 programmers and achieve
67.2% accuracy [10]. We are able to handle orders of
magnitude more programmers (1,600) while using less
training data with 92.83% accuracy. Furthermore, the
features we are using are not trivial to obfuscate. We are
able to maintain high accuracy while using commercial
obfuscators. While abstract syntax trees can be obfuscated to an
extent, doing so incurs significant overhead
and maintenance costs.
Contributions. First, we use syntactic features for
code stylometry. Extracting such features requires parsing of
incomplete source code using a fuzzy parser to
generate an abstract syntax tree. These features add a
component to code stylometry that has so far remained
almost completely unexplored. We provide evidence that
these features are more fundamental and harder to obfuscate. Our
complete feature set consists of a comprehensive set of around 120,000
layout-based, lexical, and
syntactic features. With this complete feature set we are
able to achieve a significant increase in accuracy compared to
previous work. Second, we show that we can
scale our method to 1,600 programmers without losing
much accuracy. Third, this method is not specific to C or
C++, and can be applied to any programming language.
We collected C++ source of thousands of contestants
from the annual international competition Ã¢â¬ÅGoogle Code
JamÃ¢â¬Â. A bagging (portmanteau of Ã¢â¬Åbootstrap aggregatingÃ¢â¬Â)
classifier - random forest was used to attribute programmers to source
code. Our classifiers reach 98% accuracy in a 250-class closed world
task, 93% accuracy in
a 1,600-class closed world task, 100% accuracy on average in a
two-class task. Finally, we analyze various
attributes of programmers, types of programming tasks,
and types of features that appear to influence the success
of attribution. We identified the most important 928 features out of
120,000; 44% of them are syntactic, 1% are
layout-based and the rest of the features are lexical. 8
training files with an average of 70 lines of code is sufficient for
training when using the lexical, layout and syntactic features. We
also observe that programmers with
a greater skill set are more easily identifiable compared
to less advanced programmers and that a programmerÃ¢â¬â¢s
coding style is more distinctive in implementations of
difficult tasks as opposed to easier tasks.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
We begin by introducing applications of source code authorship
attribution considered throughout this paper in
Section 2, and present our AST-based approach in Section 3. We proceed
to give a detailed overview of the experiments conducted to evaluate
our method in Section 4
and discuss the insights they provide in Section 5. Section 6 presents
related work, and Section 7 concludes.
Jam competition, as we discuss in Section 4.1. Doubtless there will be
additional challenges in using our techniques for digital forensics or
any of the other real-world
applications. We describe some known limitations in
Section 5.
Programmer De-anonymization. In this scenario,
the analyst is interested in determining the identity of an
anonymous programmer. For example, if she has a set of
programmers who she suspects might be BitcoinÃ¢â¬â¢s creator, Satoshi,
and samples of source code from each of
these programmers, she could use the initial versions of
BitcoinÃ¢â¬â¢s source code to try to determine SatoshiÃ¢â¬â¢s identity. Of
course, this assumes that Satoshi did not make
any attempts to obfuscate his or her coding style. Given a
set of probable programmers, this is considered a closedworld machine
learning task with multiple classes where
anonymous source code is attributed to a programmer.
This is a threat to privacy for open source contributors
who wish to remain anonymous.
Ghostwriting Detection. Ghostwriting detection is
related to but different from traditional plagiarism detection. We are
given a suspicious piece of code and one or
more candidate pieces of code that the suspicious code
may have been plagiarized from. This is a well-studied
problem, typically solved using code similarity metrics,
as implemented by widely used tools such as MOSS [6],
JPlag [25], and Sherlock [24].
For example, a professor may want to determine
whether a studentÃ¢â¬â¢s programming assignment has been
written by a student who has previously taken the class.
Unfortunately, even though submissions of the previous
year are available, the assignments may have changed
considerably, rendering code-similarity based methods
ineffective. Luckily, stylometry can be applied in this
settingÃ¢â¬âwe find the most stylistically similar piece of
code from the previous yearÃ¢â¬â¢s corpus and bring both students in for
gentle questioning. Given the limited set of
students, this can be considered a closed-world machine
learning problem.
Software Forensics. In software forensics, the analyst
assembles a set of candidate programmers based on previously collected
malware samples or online code repositories. Unfortunately, she cannot
be sure that the anonymous programmer is one of the candidates, making
an open world classification problem as the test sample
might not belong to any known category.
Copyright Investigation. Theft of code often leads to
copyright disputes. Informal arrangements of hired programming labor
are very common, and in the absence of
a written contract, someone might claim a piece of code
was her own after it was developed for hire and delivered.
A dispute between two parties is thus a two-class classification
problem; we assume that labeled code from both
programmers is available to the forensic expert.
Throughout this work, we consider an analyst interested
in determining the programmer of an anonymous fragment of source code
purely based on its style. To do so,
the analyst only has access to labeled samples from a set
of candidate programmers, as well as from zero or more
unrelated programmers.
The analyst addresses this problem by converting each
labeled sample into a numerical feature vector, in order to
train a machine learning classifier, that can subsequently
be used to determine the codeÃ¢â¬â¢s programmer. In particular, this
abstract problem formulation captures the following five settings and
corresponding applications (see
Table 1). The experimental formulations are presented in
Section 4.2.
We emphasize that while these applications motivate
our work, we have not directly studied them. Rather, we
formulate them as variants of a machine-learning (classification)
problem. Our data comes from the Google Code
Authorship Verification. Finally, we may suspect
that a piece of code was not written by the claimed programmer, but
have no leads on who the actual programmer might be. This is the
authorship verification problem. In this work, we take the textbook
approach and
model it as a two-class problem where positive examples
come from previous works of the claimed programmer
and negative examples come from randomly selected unrelated
programmers. Alternatively, anomaly detection
could be employed in this setting, e.g., using a one-class
support vector machine [see 30].
As an example, a recent investigation conducted by
Verizon [17] on a US companyÃ¢â¬â¢s anomalous virtual private network
traffic, revealed an employee who was outsourcing her work to
programmers in China. In such
cases, training a classifier on employeeÃ¢â¬â¢s original code
and that of random programmers, and subsequently testing pieces of
recent code, could demonstrate if the employee was the actual
In each of these applications, the adversary may try to
actively modify the programÃ¢â¬â¢s coding style. In the software
forensics application, the adversary tries to modify
code written by her to hide her style. In the copyright and
authorship verification applications, the adversary modifies code
written by another programmer to match his
own style. Finally, in the ghostwriting application, two
of the parties may collaborate to modify the style of code
written by one to match the otherÃ¢â¬â¢s style.

different features to represent both syntax and structure
of program code (Section 3.2) and finally, we train a random forest
classifier for classification of previously unseen source files
(Section 3.3). In the following sections,
we will discuss each of these steps in detail and outline
design decisions along the way. The code for our approach is made
available as open-source to allow other
researchers to reproduce our results1 .
To date, methods for source code authorship attribution focus mostly
on sequential feature representations of
code such as byte-level and feature level n-grams [8, 13].
While these models are well suited to capture naming
conventions and preference of keywords, they are entirely language
agnostic and thus cannot model author
characteristics that become apparent only in the composition of
language constructs. For example, an authorÃ¢â¬â¢s
tendency to create deeply nested code, unusually long
functions or long chains of assignments cannot be modeled using n-grams alone.
Addressing these limitations requires source code to
be parsed. Unfortunately, parsing C/C++ code using traditional
compiler front-ends is only possible for complete
code, i.e., source code where all identifiers can be resolved. This
severely limits their applicability in the setting of authorship
attribution as it prohibits analysis of
lone functions or code fragments, as is possible with simple n-gram models.
As a compromise, we employ the fuzzy parser Joern that has been
designed specifically with incomplete
code in mind [32]. Where possible, the parser produces
abstract syntax trees for code fragments while ignoring
fragments that cannot be parsed without further information. The
produced syntax trees form the basis for
our feature extraction procedure. While they largely preserve the
information required to create n-grams or bagof-words representations,
in addition, they allow a wealth
of features to be extracted that encode programmer habits
visible in the codeÃ¢â¬â¢s structure.
As an example, consider the function foo as shown
in Figure 1, and a simplified version of its corresponding abstract
syntax tree in Figure 2. The function contains a number of common
language constructs found
in many programming languages, such as if-statements
(line 3 and 7), return-statements (line 4, 8 and 10), and
function call expressions (line 6). For each of these constructs, the
abstract syntax tree contains a corresponding
node. While the leaves of the tree make classical syntactic features
such as keywords, identifiers and operators accessible, inner nodes
represent operations showing

We emphasize that code stylometry that is robust to
adversarial manipulation is largely left to future work.
However, we hope that our demonstration of the power
of features based on the abstract syntax tree will serve as
the starting point for such research.
Fuzzy Abstract Syntax Trees
De-anonymizing Programmers
One of the goals of our research is to create a classifier
that automatically determines the most likely author of
a source file. Machine learning methods are an obvious
choice to tackle this problem, however, their success crucially
depends on the choice of a feature set that clearly
represents programming style. To this end, we begin by
parsing source code, thereby obtaining access to a wide
range of possible features that reflect programming language use
(Section 3.1). We then define a number of

Feature Extraction
Analyzing coding style using machine learning approaches is not
possible without a suitable representation of source code that clearly
expresses program style.
To address this problem, we present the Code Stylometry Feature Set
(CSFS), a novel representation of source
code developed specifically for code stylometry. Our feature set
combines three types of features, namely lexical
features, layout features and syntactic features. Lexical
and layout features are obtained from source code while
the syntactic features can only be obtained from ASTs.
We now describe each of these feature types in detail.
Figure 2: Corresponding Abstract Syntax Tree
how these basic elements are combined to form expressions and
statements. In effect, the nesting of language
constructs can also be analyzed to obtain a feature set
representing the codeÃ¢â¬â¢s structure.
Lexical and Layout Features
We begin by extracting numerical features from the
source code that express preferences for certain identifiers and
keywords, as well as some statistics on the use
of functions or the nesting depth. Lexical and layout features can be
calculated from the source code, without
having access to a parser, with basic knowledge of the
programming language in use. For example, we measure the number of
functions per source line to determine
the programmerÃ¢â¬â¢s preference of longer over shorter functions.
Furthermore, we tokenize the source file to obtain
the number of occurrences of each token, so called word
unigrams. Table 2 gives an overview of lexical features.
In addition, we consider layout features that represent
code-indentation. For example, we determine whether
the majority of indented lines begin with whitespace
or tabulator characters, and we determine the ratio of
whitespace to the file size. Table 3 gives a detailed description of
these features.
*About 55,000 for 250 authors with 9 files.
Table 2: Lexical Features
Syntactic Features
The syntactic feature set describes the properties of the
language dependent abstract syntax tree, and keywords.
Calculating these features requires access to an abstract
syntax tree. All of these features are invariant to changes
in source-code layout, as well as comments.
Table 4 gives an overview of our syntactic features.
We obtain these features by preprocessing all C++ source
files in the dataset to produce their abstract syntax trees.

particular type of node. The inverse document frequency
is calculated by dividing the number of authors in the
dataset by the number of authors that use that particular
node. Consequently, we are able to capture how rare of a
node it is and weight it more according to its rarity.
The maximum depth of an abstract syntax tree reflects the deepest
level a programmer nests a node in the
solution. The average depth of the AST nodes shows
how nested or deep a programmer tends to use particular
structural pieces. And lastly, term frequency of each C++
keyword is calculated. Each of these features is written
to a feature vector to represent the solution file of a specific
author and these vectors are later used in training
and testing by machine learning classifiers.
Table 3: Layout Features
Using the feature set presented in the previous section,
we can now express fragments of source code as numerical vectors,
making them accessible to machine learning
algorithms. We proceed to perform feature selection and
train a random forest classifier capable of identifying the
most likely author of a code fragment.
An abstract syntax tree is created for each function in the
code. There are 58 node types in the abstract syntax tree
(see Appendix A) produced by Joern [33].

Due to our heavy use of unigram term frequency and
TF/IDF measures, and the diversity of individual terms
in the code, our resulting feature vectors are extremely
large and sparse, consisting of tens of thousands of features for
hundreds of classes. The dynamic Code stylometry feature set, for
example, produced close to 120,000
features for 250 authors with 9 solution files each.
In many cases, such feature vectors can lead to overfitting (where a
rare term, by chance, uniquely identifies
a particular author). Extremely sparse feature vectors
can also damage the accuracy of random forest classifiers, as the
sparsity may result in large numbers of zerovalued features being
selected during the random subsampling of the features to select a
best split. This reduces the number of Ã¢â¬ËusefulÃ¢â¬â¢ splits that can be
at any given node, leading to poorer fits and larger trees.
Large, sparse feature vectors can also lead to slowdowns
in model fitting and evaluation, and are often more difficult to
interpret. By selecting a smaller number of more
informative features, the sparsity in the feature vector can
be greatly reduced, thus allowing the classifier to both
produce more accurate results and fit the data faster.
We therefore employed a feature selection step using
WEKAÃ¢â¬â¢s information gain [26] criterion, which evaluates
the difference between the entropy of the distribution of
classes and the entropy of the conditional distribution of
classes given a particular feature:
*About 45,000 for 250 authors with 9 files.
**About 7,000 for 250 authors with 9 files.
**About 4,000 for 150 authors with 6 files.
**About 2,000 for 25 authors with 9 files.
Table 4: Syntactic Features
The AST node bigrams are the most discriminating
features of all. AST node bigrams are two AST nodes
that are connected to each other. In most cases, when
used alone, they provide similar classification results to
using the entire feature set.
The term frequency (TF) is the raw frequency of a
node found in the abstract syntax trees for each file. The
term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) of
nodes is calculated by multiplying the term frequency of
a node by inverse document frequency. The goal in using
the inverse document frequency is normalizing the term
frequency by the number of authors actually using that
Feature Selection
IG(A, Mi ) = H(A) Ã¢Ëâ H(A|Mi )
where A is the class corresponding to an author, H is
Shannon entropy, and Mi is the ith feature of the dataset.
Intuitively, the information gain can be thought of as
measuring the amount of information that the observation of the value
of feature i gives about the class label
associated with the example.
To reduce the total size and sparsity of the feature vector, we
retained only those features that individually had
non-zero information gain. (These features can be referred to as
IG-CSFS throughout the rest of the paper.)
Note that, as H(A|Mi ) Ã¢â°Â¤ H(A), information gain is always
non-negative. While the use of information gain
on a variable-per-variable basis implicitly assumes independence
between the features with respect to their impact on the class label,
this conservative approach to feature selection means that we only use
features that have
demonstrable value in classification.
To validate this approach to feature selection, we applied this method
to two distinct sets of source code files,
and observed that sets of features with non-zero information gain were
nearly identical between the two sets, and
the ranking of features was substantially similar between
the two. This suggests that the application of information
gain to feature selection is producing a robust and consistent set of
features (see Section 4 for further discussion). All the results are
calculated by using CSFS and
IG-CSFS. Using IG-CSFS on all experiments demonstrates how these
features generalize to different datasets
that are larger in magnitude. One other advantage of IGCSFS is that it
consists of a few hundred features that
result in non-sparse feature vectors. Such a compact representation of
coding style makes de-anonymizing thousands of programmers possible in
of features can be found using the out of bag (oob) error
estimate, or the error estimate derived from those samples not
selected for training on a given tree.
During classification, each test example is classified
via each of the trained decision trees by following the binary
decisions made at each node until a leaf is reached,
and the results are then aggregated. The most populous
class can be selected as the output of the forest for simple
classification, or classifications can be ranked according
to the number of trees that Ã¢â¬ËvotedÃ¢â¬â¢ for a label when performing
relaxed attribution (see Section 4.3.4).
We employed random forests with 300 trees, which
empirically provided the best trade-off between accuracy
and processing time. Examination of numerous oob values across
multiple fits suggested that (logM) + 1 random features (where M
denotes the total number of features) at each split of the decision
trees was in fact optimal in all of the experiments (listed in Section
4), and
was used throughout. Node splits were selected based on
the information gain criteria, and all trees were grown to
the largest extent possible, without pruning.
The data was analyzed via k-fold cross-validation,
where the data was split into training and test sets stratified by
author (ensuring that the number of code samples per author in the
training and test sets was identical across authors). k varies
according to datasets and
is equal to the number of instances present from each
author. The cross-validation procedure was repeated 10
times, each with a different random seed. We report the
average results across all iterations in the results, ensuring that
they are not biased by improbably easy or difficult to classify
Random Forest Classification
We used the random forest ensemble classifier [7] as
our classifier for authorship attribution. Random forests
are ensemble learners built from collections of decision
trees, each of which is grown by randomly sampling
N training samples with replacement, where N is the
number of instances in the dataset. To reduce correlation between
trees, features are also subsampled; commonly (logM) + 1 features are
selected at random (without replacement) out of M, and the best split
on these
(logM) + 1 features is used to split the tree nodes. The
number of selected features represents one of the few
tuning parameters in random forests: increasing the number of features
increases the correlation between trees in
the forest which can harm the accuracy of the overall ensemble,
however increasing the number of features that
can be chosen at each split increases the classification accuracy of
each individual tree making them stronger classifiers with low error
rates. The optimal range of number
In the evaluation section, we present the results to the
possible scenarios formulated in the problem statement
and evaluate our method. The corpus section gives an
overview of the data we collected. Then, we present the
main results to programmer de-anonymization and how
it scales to 1,600 programmers, which is an immediate
privacy concern for open source contributors that prefer
to remain anonymous. We then present the training data
requirements and efficacy of types of features. The obfuscation
section discusses a possible countermeasure to
programmer de-anonymization. We then present possible machine learning
formulations along with the verification section that extends the
approach to an open world
problem. We conclude the evaluation with generalizing
the method to other programming languages and providing software
engineering insights.
4.1
(ii) Within each year, we ordered the corpus files by the
round in which they were written, and by the problem
within a round, as all competitors proceed through the
same sequence of rounds in that year. As a result, we
performed stratified cross validation on each program file
by the year it was written, by the round in which the program was
written, by the problems solved in the round,
and by the authorÃ¢â¬â¢s highest round completed in that year.
Some limitations of this dataset are that it does not allow us to
assess the effect of style guidelines that may
be imposed on a project or attributing code with multiple/mixed
programmers. We leave these interesting
questions for future work, but posit that our improved results with
basic stylometry make them worthy of study.
One concern in source code authorship attribution is that
we are actually identifying differences in coding style,
rather than merely differences in functionality. Consider
the case where Alice and Bob collaborate on an open
source project. Bob writes user interface code whereas
Alice works on the network interface and backend analytics. If we used
a dataset derived from their project,
we might differentiate differences between frontend and
backend code rather than differences in style.
In order to minimize these effects, we evaluate our
method on the source code of solutions to programming
tasks from the international programming competition
Google Code Jam (GCJ), made public in 2008 [2]. The
competition consists of algorithmic problems that need
to be solved in a programming language of choice. In
particular, this means that all programmers solve the
same problems, and hence implement similar functionality, a property
of the dataset crucial for code stylometry
The dataset contains solutions by professional programmers, students,
academics, and hobbyists from 166
countries. Participation statistics are similar over the
years. Moreover, it contains problems of different difficulty, as the
contest takes place in several rounds. This
allows us to assess whether coding style is related to programmer
experience and problem difficulty.
The most commonly used programming language was
C++, followed by Java, and Python. We chose to investigate source code
stylometry on C++ and C because of
their popularity in the competition and having a parser
for C/C++ readily available [32]. We also conducted
some preliminary experimentation on Python.
A validation dataset was created from 2012Ã¢â¬â¢s GCJ
competition. Some problems had two stages, where the
second stage involved answering the same problem in a
limited amount of time and for a larger input. The solution to the
large input is essentially a solution for the
small input but not vice versa. Therefore, collecting both
of these solutions could result in duplicate and identical
source code. In order to avoid multiple entries, we only
collected the small input versionsÃ¢â¬â¢ solutions to be used in
our dataset.
The programmers had up to 19 solution files in these
datasets. Solution files have an average of 70 lines of
code per programmer.
To create our experimental datasets that are discussed
in further detail in the results section;
(i) We first partitioned the corpus of files by year of competition.
The Ã¢â¬ÅmainÃ¢â¬Â dataset includes files drawn from
2014 (250 programmers). The Ã¢â¬ÅvalidationÃ¢â¬Â dataset files
come from 2012, and the Ã¢â¬Åmulti-yearÃ¢â¬Â dataset files come
from years 2008 through 2014 (1,600 programmers).
In this section, we will go over machine learning task
formulations representing five possible real-world applications
presented in Section 2.
Multiclass Closed World Task
This section presents our main experimentÃ¢â¬âdeanonymizing 250
programmers in the difficult scenario
where all programmers solved the same set of problems. The machine
learning task formulation for
de-anonymizing programmers also applies to ghostwriting detection. The
biggest dataset formed from 2014Ã¢â¬â¢s
Google Code Jam Competition with 9 solution files to
the same problem had 250 programmers. These were the
easiest set of 9 problems, making the classification more
challenging (see Section 4.3.6). We reached 91.78%
accuracy in classifying 250 programmers with the Code
Stylometry Feature Set. After applying information gain
and using the features that had information gain, the
accuracy was 95.08%.
We also took 250 programmers from different years
and randomly selected 9 solution files for each one of
them. We used the information gain features obtained
from 2014Ã¢â¬â¢s dataset to see how well they generalize.
We reached 98.04% accuracy in classifying 250 programmers. This is 3%
higher than the controlled large
datasetÃ¢â¬â¢s results. The accuracy might be increasing because of using
a mixed set of Google Code Jam problems, which potentially contains
the possible solutionsÃ¢â¬â¢
properties along with programmersÃ¢â¬â¢ coding style and
makes the code more distinct.
We wanted to evaluate our approach and validate our
method and important features. We created a dataset

... In a way, Aaron is a cautionary tale for unschooling. One of the
lessons that school teaches is that the people who make the rules
donât really have to follow them. Itâs something even the most
rebellious students learn one way or another, but Aaron looked up a
different set of rules and hacked his way out of school instead. On
one hand Aaron was happy with his choice and felt more engaged and
happier with online peers, on the other he absorbed a dangerous lesson
about navigating bureaucratic systems. Plenty of legal scholars and
technology experts thought Aaron had kept on the right side of the
letter of the law, but the criminal justice system is resistant to the
kind of hacking he tended to practice. I donât know if he considered
fleeing the country, but I doubt it. Maybe if he had lived to see
Edward Snowden make dodging extradition look good, things would have
been different.
I was surprised when I saw the security footage of Aaron entering the
MIT building, his bike helmet held half-heartedly in front of his
face, his telltale hair poking out the sides. I had read the
Manifesto, but I didnât think it really reflected Aaronâs intentions.
I was worried about what could happen to him, but not that worried. I
figured he had enough institutional support to keep his punishment to
a slap on the wrist. Mostly I was angry that he hadnât taken what he
was doing seriously enough; with a team and a little bit of planning,
thereâs no reason the authorities should have been able to tie Aaron
to the action. But covert ops wasnât one of his strengths, and he
never got the chance to learn.
If Iâm part of the we that counted on Aaron, then Iâm also part of the
we that failed him. I thought his connections and credibility and
reputation would keep him safe, and maybe he did too. Maybe we
convinced him that a boy like him could change the world, or at least
always hack an escape route. But thereâs no individual who canât be
picked off if they cross the wrong line, or just the wrong prosecutor.

Eric Holder is back at Covington & Burling after serving as U.S.
attorney general for six years. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty
Eric Holder has gone back to work for his old firm, the white-collar
defense heavyweight Covington & Burling. The former attorney general
decided against going for a judgeship, saying he's not ready for the
ivory tower yet. "I want to be a player," he told the National Law
Journal, one would have to say ominously.
Eric Holder
Goldman Non-Prosecution: AG Eric Holder Has No Balls Â»
Holder will reassume his lucrative partnership (he made $2.5 million
the last year he worked there) and take his seat in an office that
reportedly â this is no joke â was kept empty for him in his absence.
The office thing might have been improper, but at this point, who
cares? More at issue is the extraordinary run Holder just completed as
one of history's great double agents. For six years, while brilliantly
disguised as the attorney general of the United States, he was
actually working deep undercover, DiCaprio in The Departed-style, as
the best defense lawyer Wall Street ever had.
Holder denied there was anything weird about returning to one of Wall
Street's favorite defense firms after six years of letting one banker
after another skate on monstrous cases of fraud, tax evasion, market
manipulation, money laundering, bribery and other offenses.
"Just because I'm at Covington doesn't mean I will abandon the public
interest work," he told CNN. He added to the National Law Journal that
a big part of the reason he was going back to private practice was
because he wanted to give back to the community.
"The firm's emphasis on pro bono work and being engaged in the civic
life of this country is consistent with my worldview that lawyers need
to be socially active," he said.
Right. He's going back to Covington & Burling because of the firm's
emphasis on pro bono work.
Here's a man who just spent six years handing out soft-touch
settlements to practically every Too Big to Fail bank in the world.
Now he returns to a firm that represents many of those same companies:
Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, to
name a few.
Collectively, the decisions he made while in office saved those firms
a sum that is impossible to calculate with exactitude. But even going
by the massive rises in share price observed after he handed out these
deals, his service was certainly worth many billions of dollars to
Wall Street.
Now he will presumably collect assloads of money from those very same
bankers. It's one of the biggest quid pro quo deals in the history of
government service. Congressman Billy Tauzin once took a $2
million-a-year job lobbying for the pharmaceutical industry just a few
weeks after helping to pass the revolting Prescription Drug Benefit
Bill, but what Holder just did makes Tauzin look like a guy who once
took a couple of Redskins tickets.
In this light, telling reporters that you're going back to Covington &
Burling to be "engaged in the civic life of this country" seems like a
joke for us all to suck on, like announcing that he's going back to
get a doctorate at the University of Blow Me.
Holder doesn't look it, but he was a revolutionary. He
institutionalized a radical dualistic approach to criminal justice,
essentially creating a system of indulgences wherein the world's
richest companies paid cash for their sins and escaped the sterner
punishments the law dictated.
Here are five pillars of the Holder revolution:
Alayne Fleischmann
The $9 Billion Witness: JPMorgan Chase's Worst Nightmare Â»
One is that he failed to win a single conviction in court for any
crimes related to the financial crisis. The only trial of any
consequence brought by his Justice Department for crimes related to
the crisis involved a pair of Bear Stearns nimrods named Ralph Cioffi
and Matthew Tannin, who confided in each other via email that the
subprime markets were "toast" but told their clients something very
different to keep them invested.
After a jury acquitted both in early 2009, the Holder Justice
Department turtled. Sources inside the DOJ told me over the years that
both Holder and his deputy, fellow Covington & Burling alum Lanny
Breuer, were obsessed with winning and refused to chance any case
where they felt a jury might go sideways on them. Thus the
Cioffi-Tannin case was the last financial crisis case they dared to
bring into to a criminal courtroom â virtually every other case ended
in settlements.
Two: Holder famously invented a concept called "collateral
consequences," under which the state could pursue non-criminal
alternatives for companies if they believed prosecuting them might
result in too much "collateral" damage. Britain's HSBC bank, which
admitted to massive money laundering violations, and the Swiss bank
UBS, which was caught manipulating the Libor interest rate benchmark,
were examples of firms that escaped vigorous prosecution because
Holder and his lackeys were, ostensibly anyway, concerned about
market-altering consequences.
Significantly, both banks were later caught up in even more serious
scandals, leading to criticism that stiffer punishments the first time
around might have prevented future damage. Holder's successor Loretta
Lynch was even forced to rip up Holder's UBS deal for being
insufficiently punitive. It's worth noting that Holder, before he
became attorney general, represented UBS at Covington & Burling.
Holder's lenient policies were deployed at a time when fellow
officials like Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke were using bailout monies
to merge troubled firms together and create even larger
mega-companies. Chase and Wells Fargo, which swallowed up Washington
Mutual and Wachovia in state-aided takeovers, were prototypes of the
modern mega-bank. So when Holder wedded "collateral consequences" to
these new Too Big to Fail mega-firms, he created Too Big to Jail. This
is a huge part of his legacy, the creation of an unjailable class.
Three: Holder also pioneered the extrajudicial settlement, striking
huge deals with companies in which judges did not sign off on the
agreements. The arrangement prevented pesky judges like the irksome
Jed Rakoff (who voided a pair of settlements he felt were inadequate)
from protesting lenient justice.
This essentially institutionalized the backroom deal. Everything was
done in secret, and there was no longer any opportunity for judges or
anyone else to check the power of the executive branch to hand out
financial indulgences.
The watchdog group Better Markets described the $13 billion Chase
settlement, one of the biggest extrajudicial deals, as "an
unprecedented settlement amount [that] cannotâ¦immunize the DOJ from
having to obtain independent judicial review of its otherwise
unilateral, secret actions."
Four: There is a huge misconception, pushed equally by odd bedfellows
in the financial community and Obama supporters, that Eric Holder
didn't send anyone from Wall Street to jail because "no one broke any
This preposterous meme grew out of something Barack Obama said on 60
Minutes. Here are the president's exact words:
"Some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street â in some cases
some of the least ethical behavior on Wall Street â wasn't illegal."
Obama, a brilliant lawyer and wordsmith, was not saying that all of
the behavior leading to the crash was legal. He merely said that some
of the worst behavior wasn't illegal. Which is true. Meaningless, but
Of course, some of the worst behavior was very illegal. This is
confirmed in the fact that Holder extracted billions of dollars in
settlement monies and even, in a few cases, obtained guilty pleas for
crimes like fraud, manipulation, bribery, money laundering and tax
Anyone who even tries to claim that none of the banks actually did
anything illegal should be directed to the HSBC settlement of December
2012. In this deferred prosecution agreement, Europe's largest bank
paid $1.92 billion to settle their responsibility for violations of
the Bank Secrecy Act and other laws.
This is from a description of HSBC's crimes by Holder's Justice Department:
"As a result of HSBC Bank USA's AML failures, at least $881 million in
drug trafficking proceeds â including proceeds of drug trafficking by
the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexicoâ¦were laundered through HSBC Bank USA."
You might remember the Sinaloa cartel for their ISIS-style,
unforgettably upsetting torture videos. HSBC washed their cash. They
even created special teller windows to make their deposits easier.
This is admitted, not alleged.
But Holder went out of his way to let them keep their U.S. charter. He
gave their executives a grand total of zero days in jail, zero dollars
in individual fines.
To reiterate: HSBC laundered money for guys who chop peoples' heads
off with chainsaws. So we can dispense with the "but no one broke any
laws" thing.
When asked about this in testimony before the Senate, Holder told
elected officials he was concerned harsher penalties against firms
like HSBC would "have a negative impact on the national economy," and
that this "has an inhibiting influenceâ¦on our ability to bring
resolutions that I think would be more appropriate."
Compare this to what he just said after returning to Covington & Burling:
"I think that what we did in the department was, I always like to say,
appropriately aggressive. There may be clients that, for whatever
reason, will not decide to work with me..."
Oddly enough, Holder used that same phrase â "appropriately
aggressive" â in his Senate testimony. In other words, the attorney
general said he was "inhibited" from giving "appropriate" punishments
just a few moments before claiming his punishments were appropriate.
This is classic Clintonian politics, saying two things at the same
time, neither of them true.
Five: Holder contributed countless subtle inventions to soften
punishments. The most revolting in my view was allowing banks like
Chase the courtesy of calling their settlements "remedial payments"
instead of fines for wrongdoing.
This seemingly insignificant semantic tweak allowed the bank to call
$7 billion of their settlement a business expense, which meant they
could claim it as a tax deduction, which in turn meant that taxpayers
like you and me paid a whopping $2.45 billion of Chase's penalty.
Some of the write-ups of these decisions emanating from the financial
and legal press were hilarious. Law360.com, noting that the settlement
language meant that 35 percent of the bank's regulatory burden would
be shifted "onto the backs of taxpayers," pointed out, as if
surprised, that the tax treatment "sparked debate" and that "some are
even angry about it." Shocking!
Of course, none of us mortals can deduct so much as a speeding ticket,
since we wouldn't want to use the tax code to encourage speeding. So
why was it OK for the nation's top cop to make fraud or money
laundering a tax-subsidized activity?
There were other tricks. Banks that committed multiple violations of
the same offense were often allowed to settle or plead to just one
count. And in many cases the fines were staggeringly low compared to
the volume of crime â BNP-Paribas, for instance, paid $8.9 billion
after laundering $30 billion, meaning they paid about 27 cents per
dollar of violations.
Holder is a cynic of a type that's increasingly common in Washington.
To follow his Justice Department was like watching an endless reel of
The Good Wife â smart lawyers half-cleverly constructing one unseemly
moral compromise after another, always justifying it to themselves in
the end somehow in the name of keeping the ball rolling.
Holder doubtless seriously believed at first that in a time of
financial crisis, he was doing the right thing in constructing new
forms of justice for banks, where nobody but the shareholders actually
had to pay for crime. You've heard of victimless crimes; Holder
created the victimless punishment.
But in the end, it was pretty convenient, wasn't it, that "the right
thing" also happened to be the strategy that preserved Democratic
Party relationships with big-dollar donors, kept the client base at
Holder's old firm nice and fat, made the influential rich immeasurably
richer and allowed Eric Holder himself to crash-land into a giant pile
of money upon resignation.
What a coincidence! In any civilized country, it'd be a scandal. In
America, though, he's just another guy selling whatever he can to get
by. It was just too bad that what Holder had to sell was the criminal
justice system.

The Actress Who Linked Up Sean Penn with El Chapo Was Under
Surveillance Since 2014
By Nathaniel Janowitz
January 12, 2016 | 1:05 am
Kate del Castillo â the actress who took Sean Penn to interview El
Chapo â had already been under surveillance for her links to the drug
lord for 14 months before the meeting took place in a mountain
In the wake of the kingpin's recapture on Friday, Mexican authorities
said that the monitoring of contacts with actors and producers aided
the manhunt launched in the the wake of his tunnel escape from prison
in July. An unnamed official told The Associated Press that the Penn
interview in October directly led to an operation that almost caught
up with him then.

Drug Lord's Capture
Now El Universal has published details of the surveillance of Del
Castillo it claims was well-established before his escape from the
Altiplano maximum-security prison and continued after he was a
fugitive. It said their contact included letters exchanged while he
was in jail, as well as several meetings between the actress and
GuzmÃ¡n's lawyers prior to their mountain encounter.
The article is backed up by photos purported to be taken before and
during the meetings, as well as snaps of her and Penn meeting GuzmÃ¡n's
associates upon arrival in Mexico on October 2 on their way to
interview El Chapo.
The paper said the surveillance of Del Castillo began in August 2014.
El Chapo reportedly instructed one of his lawyers, AndrÃ©s Granados
Flores, to contact her about making a biopic about his life. Through
GuzmÃ¡n's legal team the actress and drug lord wrote to each other
regarding the project.
Related: How Kate del Castillo Became the Rebel Celebrity Who Took
Sean Penn to 'Chapo'
The first face-to-face meeting between Del Castillo and Granados
reportedly took place on June 16, 2015 â still nearly a month before
Chapo's jailbreak â in an upscale restaurant named the San Ãngel Inn,
located in the south of Mexico City. The paper claimed it has seen
photographs from the meeting showing the actress wearing a black
blouse and a white skirt, while the lawyer wore a black suit.
El Universal said that Del Castillo and Granados met again after Chapo
was on the run, on September 25, in the Western City of Guadalajara. A
published photograph purports to show her after arriving on the
airline AeromÃ©xico, flight 783, from Los Angeles.
Another from the following day claims to show her sitting in a
restaurant with Granados and another member of GuzmÃ¡n's legal team,
Ãscar Manuel GÃ³mez NÃºÃ±ez.
The report said she saw the lawyers twice on that occasion. First for
dinner and the following morning when they gave her a phone with some
sort of special features that would allow her to communicate directly
with Joaquin GuzmÃ¡n.
The timing of this meeting appears to be reinforced by Sean Penn's
Rolling Stone article in which he says that on September 28 he got
confirmation from his contact with Del Castillo that he would be able
to meet Chapo.
Penn wrote that he and Del Castillo flew from Los Angeles to an
unnamed "city in mid-Mexico" in a chartered plane four days later.
According to the article in El Universal, the city was Guadalajara and
the plane was a Hawker 900XP private jet. The paper published a photo
it said was of the actors meeting the lawyer. From there they
reportedly went to the Hotel Villa Ganza where they registered,
dropped off their equipment, and left.
From Guadalajara the paper cited the surveillance tracking the two
actors in two vans to Tepic, the capital of Nayarit state. Penn also
said they travelled to another city that he did not name.
Both accounts say the group boarded two private planes â El Universal
says one was white and the other yellow â at a tourist resort with a
private airstrip that took them into the Golden Triangle mountain
According to Penn's article, they were accompanied by one of El
Chapo's sons, Alfredo GuzmÃ¡n.
Penn noted in his article his own concerns about being tracked in the
plane but said that Chapo's son put him at ease by pointing out a "red
scrambler switch below the cockpit controls" that he claimed blocked
ground radar and that an inside man provided them with information
about when the military's high-altitude surveillance plane has been
"He has great confidence that there are no unwanted eyes on us," Penn wrote.
Military technology and weaponry expert, Dr. Robert J. Bunker, was confused.

planning and technology that borders on simple fantasy."
Bunker suggested that somebody may had "sold the narcos a 'high
technology scrambling system'âbut it really doesn't work." Another
possibility could be that Penn was told a story to calm his fears.
After the flight, they arrived in the Golden Triangle. After a long
road trip they met El Chapo for seven hours of chatting, tequila, and
tacos, before agreeing to meet eight days later for a two-day long
This interview never took place because three days after Chapo, Penn
and Del Castillo met, the kingpin narrowly slipped a navy operation to
capture him.
An unnamed source in Mexican federal law enforcement told The
Associated Press that it was the Penn interview that triggered that
Some, however, are not so sure.
Mexican columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio wrote on Monday on the website
ejecentral that the authorities had already identified Chapo's precise
location in the Sierra before the interview.
While he says that surveillance of Del Castillo would have provided
useful information in the manhunt for the fugitive after his escape,
her presence in the area alongside a major movie star actually
postponed the operation to try and capture him.
"The US requested that the operation to capture him be postponed 72
hours," Riva Palacio told VICE News, insisting he had two reliable
Mexican sources confirming this. "My theory is that they are putting
the emphasis on the actors because they are protecting somebody,
perhaps undercover people."
In the end Chapo escaped that operation and was not tracked down until
Friday, January 8, in the northern city of Los Mochis, Sinaloa.
A gopro video was released on Monday showing the initial stage of the
raid on a safe house where GuzmÃ¡n was hiding. Gun shots and arrests
take place for 15 minutes as they search for El Chapo in the video.
The drug lord had slipped out of the house into the city's sewage
system through a hole tunnel reportedly built in a closet. He was
caught hours after resurfacing, stealing a vehicle, and attempting to
flee the city.
Penn's article created a major stir when it was published on Saturday
night. The star said he had "nothin' to hide" in a brief email
exchange with The Associated Press. Del Castillo has yet to make any
comment at all, other than to tell a reporter from Univision,
"Everything when and how it should be. Don't call me again."

What Sidney Blumenthalâs Memos to Hillary Clinton Said, and How They
Were Handled
By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDTMAY 18, 2015
In 2011 and 2012, Hillary Rodham Clinton received at least 25 memos
about Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and confidant who at the
time was employed by the Clinton Foundation. The memos, written in the
style of intelligence cables, make up about a third of the almost 900
pages of emails related to Libya that Mrs. Clinton said she kept on
the personal email account she used exclusively as secretary of state.
Some of Mr. Blumenthalâs memos appeared to be based on reports
supplied by American contractors he was advising as they sought to do
business in Libya. Mr. Blumenthal also appeared to be gathering
information from anonymous Libyan and Western officials and local news
media reports. What follows are descriptions of some of the memos and
how they were handled by Mrs. Clinton and her aides.
Clinton Says Idea on Rebels Should Be Considered
In April 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo about the rebel
forces fighting the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The rebels, Mr.
Blumenthal wrote, were considering hiring security contractors to
train their forces. Mrs. Clinton forwarded the memo to her aide, Jake
Sullivan, and said that the idea should be considered. (Pages 1-3)
Clinton Friendâs Libya Role Blurs Lines of Politics and Business
Sidney Blumenthal counseled Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was
secretary of state about Libya, where he was also advising a business
In 2011 and 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded 18 memos to Mr. Sullivan, who
in turn circulated them to senior State Department officials,
including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the
2012 attacks in Benghazi, and Ambassador Gene A. Cretz, who preceded
=An Alert to Possible Terrorist Attacks in Libya
In May 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo reporting that
affiliates of Al Qaeda in Libya were plotting attacks in revenge for
the United Statesâ killing of Osama bin Laden. Mrs. Clinton forwarded
the email to Mr. Sullivan, saying that it was âdisturbing, if true.â
Mr. Sullivan questioned its accuracy, but said he would share with
others. (Pages 4-5)
=Highlighting the Role of a Potential Business Partner
In January 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton about challenges
facing Libyaâs new government. In the memo, Mr. Blumenthal said that
Libyaâs prime minister was bringing in new economic advisers, and that
a businessman, Najib Obeida, was among âthe most influential of this
group.â At the time, Mr. Obeida was a potential business partner for a
group of contractors whom Mr. Blumenthal was advising. Mrs. Clinton
instructed Mr. Sullivan to ask for a response from senior State
Department officials including Mr. Cretz, then the ambassador to
Libya. (Pages 6-15)
=A Memo Is Passed On, Despite Questions
In March 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded a memo by Mr. Blumenthal to Mr.
Sullivan, saying that she was dubious about its content. Mr. Sullivan
agreed, stating that Mr. Blumenthalâs report resembled âa conspiracy
theoryâ â but still asked State Department officials to review it.
(Pages 16-17)
=A Warning Is Forwarded to Incoming Ambassador
In April 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton warning about the
imminent rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya. Mrs. Clinton
forwarded the memo to Mr. Sullivan, who sent it to Mr. Stevens, the
incoming United States ambassador to Libya. Mr. Stevensâ response â
that the Brotherhood in fact had a relatively small following in Libya
â was passed on to Mrs. Clinton. (Pages 18-24)
=Clinton Suggests Sharing Information With Israel
After receiving an August 2012 memo from Mr. Blumenthal about how the
new Libyan prime minister wanted to have a better relationship with
Israel, Mrs. Clinton suggested to Mr. Sullivan that they pass the
intelligence along to the Israelis. (Pages 25-27)

Censor or die: The death of Mexican news in the age of drug cartels
By Dana Priest December 11, 2015
CONTROLLING THE STORY: This is the fifth installment in an ongoing
series examining the human cost of reporting the news around the
One journalist's experience on Mexico's deadliest beat
REYNOSA, Mexico â As deadline descended on El MaÃ±anaâs newsroom and
reporters rushed to file their stories, someone in the employ of a
local drug cartel called with a demand from his crime boss.
The caller was a journalist for another newspaper, known here as an
enlace, or âlinkâ to the cartel. The compromised journalist barked out
the order: Publish an article saying the mayor in Matamoros had not
paid the cartel $2 million a month in protection fees, as an El MaÃ±ana
front-page story had alleged the day before.
âThey want us to say heâs not guilty,â the editor who took the call
told his colleagues during the episode in late October. Knowing
glances passed between them as a visiting Washington Post reporter
looked on.
They all knew that defiance carried a high price.
The enlaces are part of the deeply institutionalized system of cartel
censorship imposed on media outlets in northeastern Mexico abutting
the border of Texas. How it works is an open secret in newsrooms here
but not among readers. They are unaware of the life-and-death
decisions editors make every day not to anger different local cartel
commanders, each of whom has his own media philosophy.
Submitting to cartel demands is the only way to survive, said
Hildebrando âBrandoâ Deandar Ayala, 39, editor in chief of El MaÃ±ana,
one of the oldest and largest newspapers in the region with a print
circulation of 30,000. âYou do it or you die, and nobody wants to
die,â he said. âAuto censura â self-censorship â thatâs our shield.â
Readers get angry when they donât get the news they need, he said.
Resentment against El MaÃ±ana grew so strong two years ago that
reporters took the logos off their cars and stopped carrying their
identification on assignments.
âThe readers hate us sometimes,â Deandar said. âBut they donât know
the real risks we go through.â
Mexico has long been a deadly place for reporters. Some 88 journalists
have been slain in the last two decades, according to Article 19, a
worldwide advocacy group that promotes press freedom.
With its endless drug wars, Mexico is one of the most dangerous places
in a world that has seen a recent upswing in violence against
journalists, with scores of reporters killed or jailed in Afghanistan,
Pakistan, the Arab Spring countries, Central America and the former
Soviet bloc.
[Read previous stories from this series]
The risks have been especially high for El MaÃ±ana because its
circulation area is bounded to the west by the birthplace of the Zetas
criminal network in Nuevo Laredo and to the east by the Gulf crime
syndicateâs home base in Matamoros.
In February, the last time El MaÃ±ana defied a cartelâs censorship
rules, an editor in its Matamoros bureau was dragged outside, stuffed
in a van and beaten as his abductors drove around threatening him with
âNext time, weâll kill you!â one yelled before pushing him out of the vehicle.
Four El MaÃ±ana journalists have been killed in the past 10 years.
Others survived assassination attempts, kidnappings, and grenade and
machine-gun attacks on their offices. Deandar has been shot, kidnapped
and had his home set on fire, he said.

The worst assaults began in 2004, when an editor in Nuevo Laredo was
stabbed to death. Two years later, gunmen broke into the bureau there,
detonated a grenade and sprayed machine gunfire, leaving one employee
Afterward, bulletproof glass and electronic security keys were
installed at its three offices, where the blinds are always drawn.
In March 2010, when the Gulf cartel defeated the Zetas for control of
Reynosa, it took revenge on three El MaÃ±ana reporters whom the Zetas
had forced to watch one of its mass executions.
The cartel called the three Reynosa reporters and told them, âââeither
you come in or weâll pick you up,âââ an editor there at the time
They surrendered to the cartel and were never heard from again. Their
presumed slayings were never reported by El MaÃ±ana, editors said,
because thatâs what the Gulf commander demanded. The enlace passed
word that the killings were a one-time message to the Zetas, not a
tactic the cartel intended to repeat against the newspaper.
Twice in 2012, gunmen from the Zetas shot up the offices of the Nuevo
Laredo bureau. Not long after, El MaÃ±ana announced it would no longer
print cartel news in its Nuevo Laredo edition. Articles about Nuevo
Laredo crime sometimes appear in other editions, but without a byline
or names in the story.

The cartelsâ tactics resemble those most Americans would associate
with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The display of multiple beheaded
corpses and bodies hanging from bridges are a regular occurrence.
Hundreds of young people have disappeared. Mass graves are
The comparison with terrorist groups 7,300 miles away frustrates
journalists here. They watch the endless international coverage of
Middle East violence yet know that the terrorism just across the U.S.
border is largely ignored by the American media.
Mexicoâs 2014 murder rate of 13 per 100,000 is twice as high as Afghanistanâs.
âWe have a war here, and weâre doing war reporting,â said Ildefonso
âPonchoâ Ortiz, a deeply sourced reporter for Breitbart News Networkâs
Cartel Chronicles, one of the only American outlets to track cartel
maneuvers. âSometimes AP [the Associated Press wire service] will pick
up a story, but other than that, it never leaves the valley.â
The three largest U.S. newspapers nearby â the Brownsville Herald, the
Monitor in McAllen, Tex., and the Laredo Morning Times â forbid their
reporters from crossing to report because itâs too dangerous,
according to the editors at the newspapers.
Pervasive corruption abets the violence. The local police forces have
been disbanded and replaced by the army and federal police in the
northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which includes Matamoros, Nuevo
Laredo and Reynosa.
A car bomb killed the Nuevo Laredo mayor one week after he was sworn
in. The new Matamoros mayor survived an ambush in March. Cartels
install surveillance cameras throughout their cities and employ
lookouts with cellphones to keep watch. U.S. Border Patrol officers
are regularly indicted for cooperating with organized crime.
âTamaulipas is a black hole when it comes to information,â said Aaron
Nelsen, a reporter based in McAllen for the San Antonio Express-News.
âItâs so hard to get anyone to talk about it,â even elected U.S.

A cartel media director
El MaÃ±anaâs circulation area includes major U.S. border cities; its
online editions are read as far north as San Antonio and Houston.
It is a third-generation family enterprise, founded in 1924 as an
anti-establishment voice. Over most of its 91 years, its formidable
enemies were corrupt politicians and their hand-picked prosecutors.
The newspaper now maintains a working relationship with the local
governments, as evidenced by the government advertising it receives.
Withholding state advertising dollars is a common and effective
economic hammer used against media outlets whose investigations upset
the status quo.
âWhen itâs not the politicians against us, itâs the drug dealers,â
said Heriberto Deandar, 78, who co-owns El MaÃ±ana with his brother,
Brandoâs father. âHe who is not afraid has no courage.â
Brando was raised in Reynosa but moved to McAllen in 2007 for safety
reasons. He commutes to work. Asked why he doesnât find a safer job,
he said simply, âItâs in my blood. I cannot leave.â
During a recent visit to the town, the eerie atmosphere was inescapable.
Reynosaâs wide boulevards were nearly empty. Heavily armed soldiers
patrolled in black masks to protect their identities from cartels
resentful of the armyâs two-year occupation.
Military helicopters whooped periodically overhead, racing to
shootouts or hunting suspects. At dusk, hundreds of cars streamed
slowly across the international bridge to McAllen, where an increasing
number of well-to-do Mexicans have moved their families to safety.
The Metros faction of the Gulf cartel controls much of civic life and
all contraband â drugs, sex slaves, immigrant smuggling, fuel, stolen
vehicles â in or moving through Reynosa, said journalists and media
experts here. Its commander, whose parents are from Reynosa, has a
more liberal view of the media than his counterparts in the other two
He seems to care about his image, too, they said, as evidenced by the
ânarcobannersâ that appeared on city bridges in November.
âThis is to make it clear that I am a narcotrafficker, not a terrorist
like youâve been saying in the media,â the cartel boss declared in one
handwritten sheet-sized banner. âInvestigate and check your facts.
Crime has lessened since I took charge.â
In Matamoros, though, the commander of the cartelâs Ciclones faction
tolerates no coverage. In Nuevo Laredo, the Zetas have a commander of
finance, assassinations, logistics, stolen vehicles and fuel, weapons,
prostitution, immigrant smuggling â and media.
The Zetas media director, a clean-cut, 30-something man described by
one person who knows him as âa pretty friendly guy,â calls enlaces and
beat reporters at El MaÃ±ana and other media outlets every day to tell
them what stories the cartel wants published or censored. One day itâs
a story critical of new government limits on imported cars; the next
itâs a birthday party in the social pages featuring a cartel bossâs
daughter. Sometimes the media director provides photos and video for
an article.
âItâs a common conversation every day,â one reporter said.
Reporters have learned to consult him on nearly everything, one media
expert said. Even a car crash isnât a simple car crash. âYou have to
call somebody to make sure you can write about it,â one journalist
said, because it might actually not be an accident but a purposeful
vehicular homicide organized by the cartel.
Critical coverage of local politicians is also forbidden.
For his own security, the media director changes cellphones often, but
his online avatar always stays the same: a rabbit.
The three cartel commandersâ differing media philosophies force El
MaÃ±ana to produce three distinctly different editions. âIf you want to
find out whatâs happening in Nuevo Laredo or Matamoros, you read El
MaÃ±ana de Reynosa,â Deandar said.
For example, when Mexican troops captured the leader of the Matamoros
faction in October, known as âCiclÃ³n 7,â El MaÃ±ana did not print a
word about it in its Matamoros edition. But in Reynosa and Nuevo
Laredo, it was banner news.
With CiclÃ³n 7 gone, Deandar said, âwe are waiting to see who is the
next chief, so weâll know the rules.â

Mechanics of self-censorship
After hearing the enlaceâs demand to exonerate the allegedly corrupt
mayor in Matamoros, the editor on duty rubbed his head trying to
contain himself.
âFirst they tell us what not to publish, now they are telling us what
to publish!â he yelled before heading upstairs to his office.
He dialed the editor in Matamoros who had passed the enlaceâs message
to Reynosa, put the phone on speaker mode and upped the volume so the
whole room could hear.
Enlaces pass instructions via phone calls, text messages, apps and in
personal meetings. They often communicate cartel demands to crime
reporters who show up at the scene of shootouts, blockades, car bombs
and executions.
Sometimes a cartel member will run into crime reporters at the scene.
âTheyâll say, âGet the hell out of here! Weâll kill you!â And we have
to go,â one reporter said.
Three minutes into the conversation with the Matamoros editor, the
senior editor began raising his voice about the enlace.
âGive me his name and number!â he shouted. âAnd tell him youâre not
going to take any more messages! No more! Tell him if you take any
more messages, Iâm going to fire you!â
He hung up, waved around the piece of paper with the enlaceâs name and
phone number on it and then stood up. It was getting dark. Time to
leave for a safer city.
The front-page story that upset the cartel was a reprinted interview
with the new mayor of Matamoros, Leticia Salazar, an anti-corruption
crusader. The interview was conducted by the national Excelsior
newspaper. In it, she accused her predecessor of paying the Gulf
cartel more than $2 million a month in protection fees from public
works funds and towing fees.
El MaÃ±anaâs editors felt safe publishing the interview in all editions
because it seemed like a political corruption story, not one about the
The cartel demand that followed was to run an interview with the
former mayor quoting him as saying he was innocent of the allegations.
But the former mayor had not requested an interview.
As he left the building, the duty editor said he planned to call the
former mayor on the way home.
Speeding through Reynosaâs back roads in the dark, he called the
former mayor, who said he had not requested an interview and did not
know the cartel had demanded one on his behalf.
It was time for a decision. âIf you want an interview, we can do it in
our office or over the phone,â the editor said. If itâs in the office,
âwe will need a photo of the interview; if itâs over the phone, weâll
have to record it. Either way, we need to show it was real,â not
something made up by the cartel.
We wonât publish it right away, the editor added, so the cartel wonât
think it can tell the newspaper what to print.
The interview ran three days later, in all editions, including
Matamoros, where it mattered most to the cartel. But there was no
byline, not even in the Reynosa edition. Instead, it read simply, El

in Nuevo Laredo. The message was signed âZZZZ,â normally associated
with the Zetas drug gang. (Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)
Social media steps up
Several years ago, shopkeepers, doctors, lawyers, mechanics, local
government workers and students began to fill the void in local news
with social-media coverage. It took the cartels a while to understand
what was happening on anonymous Twitter accounts and Facebook pages.
Once they did, retribution followed. On Sept. 26, 2011, the
decapitated body of a female blogger was left at the Christopher
Columbus monument in Nuevo Laredo. Next to her corpse were two
keyboards and a handwritten warning, signed âZZZZ.â
But social-media crime reporting has only grown in the four years
since. It includes real-time maps of shootout locations, slayings and
kidnappings as well as endless cellphone videos of crimes in progress.
During the Post reporterâs visit in October, alerts and bulletins
about news that went unreported by El MaÃ±ana were rife on social

Her followers frantically refreshed their Twitter feeds trying to find
her. The next morning, at 5:04 a.m., a tweet from her account
appeared: âFriends and family, my real name is Maria Del Rosario
Fuentes Rubio, Iâm a doctor and today, my life has come to an end.â
Minutes later, two photos appeared on her account. One showed Fuentes
Rubio in distress. âClose your accounts, donât risk your families the
way I did,â her account read. âI ask you all for forgiveness.â
The second photo showed what appeared to be her bloodied face and
corpse on the ground. No one has been arrested.
An opening
In February, a few months after Fuentes Rubio was killed, the two
factions of the Gulf cartel in northeastern Mexico went to war again.
The chaos provided El MaÃ±ana with the kind of journalistic opening it
hadnât had in 15 years.
With the cartel preoccupied, El MaÃ±ana became the newspaper it might
otherwise be had circumstances been different. The entire newsroom
deployed to cover the battles. Dramatic photos, detailed articles and
screaming headlines won Mexicoâs attention.
Readers in Reynosa finally got the full story of what was happening around them:
Day One: âBorder in Shock,â âShoot-Outs and Roadblocks .â.â. â
Day Two: âBorder Under Siege: Marines Attacked, Three Armed Men
Killed, Soldiers Woundedâ
âWe were all excited in the newsroom,â said a longtime senior editor
who shepherded the coverage. âIt was an adrenaline rush.â
âNo other newspaper in the stateâ provided such detailed coverage.
âThey were all afraid,â he said, nodding toward Deandar. âWe have a
courageous boss.â
This was such big news, Deandar said he thought at the time, that he
wanted to share it even with readers in Matamoros despite the standing
cartel news blackout there. To be cautious, there would be no bylines
and no names of cartel members.
The cartels would not approve, cautioned Enrique Juarez, his Matamoros editor.
Just after midnight, the red printing press in Reynosa rolled out Day
Threeâs edition. âNine Dead in Fighting: Third Day Siege in Urban
Areas and Roads.â Delivery trucks dashed to their distribution hubs.
By 3 a.m., El MaÃ±ana employees discovered that the truck carrying the
newspapers for Matamoros had vanished. Deandar rallied a posse; they
found the vehicle at noon in an abandoned field, still full of
newspapers. He ordered the papers be delivered to Matamoros, where
they hit the streets an hour later.
Juarez, up in his second-floor office, got threatening phone calls right away.
At 4 p.m., as deadline loomed, someone called from the lobby asking
him to come down. He found a knife and braced himself. Armed men burst
in. One picked up a big jug of water and threw it at him, causing him
to drop the knife.
âWeâre going to break you!â one yelled, as they dragged him away. They
stuffed him into a van, beat him about the head and back, and shoved
him onto the pavement an hour or so later.
Four frightened El MaÃ±ana employees in the Matamoros bureau resigned
the next day.
A story about Juarezâs abduction and a photo of him at his desk, with
the assaulting water jug, ran on Day Four next to the headline, â30
Dead Already, Mayor Suffers Grenade Attack, US Consul Suspends
It did not appear in the Matamoros edition. Juarez and his family left
the city. He no longer works in Matamoros.
He is still not right, he said in an interview. âI donât feel safe. I
look around when I go out.â He worries that the fighting cartel
factions will team up again and come after him.
âIf I had the opportunity to leave .â.â. â His voice trails off.

@_subject: Fwd: [whispersystems] Addressing Frustration in the Signal Community 
Hi All,
I have noticed that there has been some amount of frustration present
on this mailing list as of late, and I'd just like to address it as a
an observer and member of the Signal Community.
The popularity of Signal, and in particular the number of people who
want to help get involved in the project, contribute, help influence
the future of it etc... has been growing very impressively. We have
just under 1000 people on this mailing list (967 at time of writing),
multiple PRs and issues are being opened in the repos by newcomers
each day, and we have prominent people in the security community
(Edward Snowden, Various Tor People, George Torwell [1] etc...)
constantly telling everyone to use Signal.
It's clear why this is happening, Signal is the only project to have
emerged that really has the potential to put a dent in mass
surveillance since Tor, and I use the word "only" on purpose here; Yes
there are a million different privacy apps / projects that have
emerged in the last 4 years or so, and existing tools have been
improved (we have the likes of Tox, Pond, Ricochet etc... And OTR and
PGP are still going strong), but Signal has always put a very strong
focus on Usability and User Adoption, and it's these things that have
lead it to becoming as widely adopted as it is, and it's these things
we need to continue to focus on more than anything until it becomes as
popular as, for example, Whatsapp. This is why it has the potential to
put a dent in MASS surveillance.
But this is obvious to most of you, in fact it is probably these
reasons that have got you so excited about the project, and why we
have so many people getting involved in the development of Signal, and
contributing in any which way they can.
That being said, I feel that the community doesn't realise just how
big it's growing, and how that contrasts with the size of the OWS team
itself. I have so much respect for them, they are each being pulled in
a thousand different directions: development, managing + reviewing
contributions on github, responding to issues, responding to support
tickets, addressing each of the feature requests that come in (and
deciding which ones they can take on etc...), handling PR / marketing
involved and increase growth that drastically change the requirements
for the infrastructure, managing and growing the infrastructure
itself, managing finances and donations, general admin stuff, and of
course... this mailing list.
Go have a look at their website, to see how big their team is, and how
many people are working on development (and also understand that
Frederic Jacobs has recently moved on and the website is yet to be
updated)... Then look again at this list of things that they need to
handle among themselves.
Also consider how amazingly Moxie has run a tight ship, keeping strict
control of the direction of the project, and fighting to maintain
that. It's this strict process that has lead Signal to where it is
today. We can't let the project grow beyond this control, this strict
direction that is vital to the steady, consistent, continual growth
and success of the project, it can't be diluted... and yet growth is
the single most important thing we're currently fighting for.
This team is insane.
So I ask you, please don't get frustrated, I know it can be difficult,
and it can feel like you're shouting into the void, but we still need
you, the community still needs everyone who's currently involved to
stay as involved as they can and support one another. The
whispersystems team reads each and every one of the emails that come
through this mailing list, as insane as that may sound given the rest
of their work load... they just don't have time to respond to
everything, and they leave it up to us to do much of that.
We need to work together, as a community, to help the OWS team grow
this project into something even more fantastic then it is currently,
rather than just increasing their workload, and taking their focus
away from important development work and decision making. We each need
to take a step back, and make calculated contributions, and help to
make their life easier any way we can.
So where, as a community, can we go from here...
Well, the single most effective thing you could do, if you really want
to make a difference, and are able to work in San Francisco, consider
applying to work full time at OWS [2]. They need designers and
developers alike.
If like me, you're not in San Francisco, or even the USA, then you can
continue to contribute online. Keep the morale up and continue doing
what you're doing. Direct newcomers in the right directions (mailing
list, issues, support, docs, the unofficial server support google
group, etc...), and spread the word and try and get as many people to
adopt Signal as possible.
As a community, we can probably do with some better coordination as to
what each of us are doing, assigning ourselves development tasks,
doing code review, handling responding to people, discussing design /
feature requests, working out as a community which features / work we
feel are most critical etc... Feature requests, however well
intentioned, do fill up this mailing list quite a bit, but there
doesn't really seem like there is a proper (public) home for them at
the moment, issues should be focussed on bugs / minor feature requests
only, and sending an email to this list sends it to almost 1000
people... not ideal.
Perhaps there is the scope for some online space to handle / discuss
feature requests / work in progress in an open manner? and perhaps
allow the OWS team to be a little more transparent with the things
they are currently working on etc... We could then also incorporate
projects like the new windows phone initiative, and coordinate much
more effectively? Anyway that's just food for thought, and probably
best discussed another time.
In the meantime, I'm probably going to write up some intro page for
newcomers of the Signal community, to outline the landscape, and help
direct their efforts. I'll post in here when that's done.
Anyway, thanks for reading through this monster of an email! It was
mostly a brain dump on my part. =)
Oh! And make sure you watch the youtube video I linked below.

, Will FBI Take a Bite Out of Apple? Former CIA Agent on Showdown
Between Apple & U.S. Government
February 25, 2016
As the government continues to take a bite out of Apple, Apple CEO Tim
Cook says the FBIâs request to unlock the iPhone of one of the San
Bernardino shooters is the "software equivalent of cancer." In an
interview on ABC, he explained why the tech giant is resisting a court
order to help unlock the phone. The FBI says Apple is overstating the
security risk to its devices, and argues the litigation is limited.
"It wonât be unique to this one phone. It would be something that the
government can use against any phone. And even if you think that itâs
OK for the government to be able to break the encryption of anybodyâs
phone â¦ what backdoor is accessible to the U.S. government would also
be accessible to whatever is the American enemy du jour," says our
guest Barry Eisler, who has written about government surveillance in
fictional form. He is also a former CIA agent. Eisler is the author of
several books, most recently, "The Godâs Eye View."
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: We turn now to the ongoing dispute over privacy and
encryption between the FBI and the computer giant Apple. In an
interview last night on ABC, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained why his
company is resisting a court order to help unlock the iPhone of one of
the San Bernardino attackers. In December, Syed FarookâSyed Rizwan
Farook and his wife killed 14 people and injured 22 others. The two
attackers were killed in a shootout with police. Cook said what the
U.S. government was asking Apple to do was the, quote, "software
equivalent of cancer."
    TIM COOK: This case is not about one phone. This case is about the
future. What is at stake here is: Can the government compel Apple to
write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of
customers vulnerable around the world, including in the U.S.? The only
way we know would be to write a piece of software that we view as sort
of the software equivalent of cancer. We think itâs bad news to write.
We would never write it. We have never written it. And that is what is
at stake here.
AMY GOODMAN: The FBI says Apple is overstating the security risk to
its devices, and argues the litigation is limited. In an open letter
earlier this week, FBI Director James Comey wrote, quote, "The
particular legal issue is actually quite narrow. ... We donât want to
break anyoneâs encryption or set a master key loose on the land," he
said. Apple phone systems have a function that automatically erases
the access key and renders the phone permanently inaccessible after 10
failed attempts.
To talk more about the case, weâre joined by Barry Eisler, who has
written about government surveillanceâin fictional form. But heâs also
a former CIA agent. Eisler is the author of a number of books, most
recently, The Godâs Eye View.
Itâs great to have you with us.
BARRY EISLER: Thank you, Amy. Good to be here.
AMY GOODMAN: So, letâs talk about what the government is doing and the
pushback of Apple.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, I like Tim Cookâs metaphor. Itâs nice to see
someone hitting back linguistically this way. You would expect the FBI
to say what itâs saying: Itâs only about one phone. This is the kind
of thing the government always says. And Iâm reminded of the time the
CIA acknowledged that it had made two torture tapes. Fifteen months
later, it acknowledged that it was in fact 92. In this case, the
government said this is only going to be about one phone, and it took
them only a day to say, "Did we say one phone? Actually, weâre talking
about 12." If you talk to any encryption or security expert anywhere,
theyâll all tell you that what the FBI is asking for is impossible.
You canât create a backdoor for one phone without making all phones
vulnerable. So thatâs one important issue here.
But thereâs another one that I think is not adequately understood. As
Julian Sanchez, a guy I follow pretty closely because he knows a lot
about these things, works with the Cato Institute, put it, this just
isnât about encryption, itâs about conscription. And I wish people
would understand this a little bit better. Itâs unprecedented for the
government to be telling a private company what products it can create
and what features it has to include in those products. As Tim Cook
pointed out, where does this stop? What if the government said, "We
want to have a feature on the iPhone that enables the FBI to turn on
the iPhone camera, to turn on the iPhone microphone, anytime we want?
Would that also be OK?" So, I hope this isnât going to happen. Itâs
sort of odd have to be championing the worldâs richest corporation in
its fight with the government.
AMY GOODMAN: I mean, theyâre asking the Apple to write a program,
which would then create a backdoor.
BARRY EISLER: Exactly. And it wonât be unique to this one phone. It
would be something that the government could use against any phone.
And even if you think that the U.S. governmentâitâs OK for the
government to be able to break the encryption of anybodyâs phone, even
if you trust the U.S. government and think the U.S. government has
never lied anyone, never abused its powers, even if you believe
anything like that, what backdoor is accessible to the U.S. government
would also be accessible to whatever is the American enemy du
jourâcould be the Chinese government, Russia, Iran, and, of course,
not just to state actors, but also to criminal groups and hackers. A
vulnerability in a phone is not accessible to just one actor. It
becomes vulnerable to everyone.
AMY GOODMAN: But he killed 14 people, he and his wife.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: And they just want access to see if thereâs other plans.
I mean, who knows what would be?
BARRY EISLER: So this is another thing the government is typically
good at. It tries to find the most attractive fact pattern it can to
use as the thin edge of a wedge that it can then use in other less
obvious fact patterns. And I see this again and again. People donât
remember that well now, but JosÃ© PadillaâIâm sure you guys
rememberâthe so-called dirty bomber, I mean, JosÃ© Padilla was accused
of trying to create a radiological bomb and detonate it in Chicago,
and a whole lot of people were going to die. And so, to keep us safe
from that kind of thing, the government arrested him, held him on a
Navy ship, offshored himâno due process, no charges, no trial, no
access to a lawyer. It was unprecedented. But they were careful to
choose what for them was an attractive fact pattern, before doing
something so unprecedented. They picked a scary-looking guy and
accused him of doing scary things. And people didnât protest the way
they would have if they had chosen someone a little bit different.
So itâs the same thing here. Theyâre not doing this in the name of, I
donât know, preventing someone from shoplifting or something like
that. Theyâve chosen a very attractive fact pattern so that they can
say the talking points that you were just parroting, which is like,
"Come on, this is just to keep us safe from the really scary people
who want to kill us all in our beds," and who indeed did kill a lot of
people in San Bernardino.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, to what extent do you think that accounts for
public opinion? Because a recent Pew [Research] Center poll found that
51 percent of Americans think Apple should comply with the FBI and
unlock the iPhone of one of the perpetrators of the attacks, and only
38 percent said that the FBI should not, and the rest had no opinion.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, which is not actuallyâwhich is not a bad response
to anyone who thinks that Apple is doing this as some sort of
publicity stunt. I mean, for the moment, anyway, more people think
that Apple should comply than think that it shouldnât. I think the
fact that so many people, actually, that 38 percent, think itâs a
really bad idea for Apple to be forced to do this is, in part, a
tribute to the educational value of the Snowden revelations and all
the journalism thatâs been built on them, because Iâm pretty
sureâcanât really conduct this experiment, but Iâm pretty sure that if
it hadnât been for Snowdenâs revelations, the public would be focusing
entirely on the keep-us-safe-from-the-terrorists aspect of this whole
thing, and not on the but-this-is-going-to-destroy-privacy aspect.
AMY GOODMAN: I mean, interestingly, Apple has made the iCloud
available. Itâs not like they havenât done that. I mean, there have
been many requests of these different phone manufacturers to get
access to the iCloud.
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: And, I mean, the government canât just get access to it;
they have to get permission.
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: So theyâre making a distinction between the actual physical phoneâ
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: Apparently they turned off the iCloud at some pointâ
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: âso itâs whatâs remained on that phone since the point
they turned it off.
BARRY EISLER: Right. So, the idea here is that some of your data is
not accessible even by the company that created the product. Itâs on
your local device, and no one else should have access to it but you.
Apple has, in fact, complied with the government in the governmentâs
request to turn over data to which it has access. Maybe people might
like that, they might not like it. My own feeling is, look, as long as
itâs pursuant to a warrant and itâs not secret and itâs out in the
open, I can live with it. But the notion that now Apple is going to
crack encryption that its users have come to rely on to keep their
data private isâis an entirely new thing.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I want to turn to comments made by Bill Gates,
the co-founder of Microsoft. He was asked about the ongoing dispute
between Apple and the FBI, and said it was important to strike a
balance between privacy and government access. Gates was speaking to
    BILL GATES: The extreme view that the government always gets
everything, nobody supports that; having the government be blind,
people donât support that. ... I do believe thatâthat with the right
safeguards, there are cases where the government, on our behalf, like
stopping terrorism, which could get worse in the future, that that is
valuable, but striking that balance. Clearly, the governmentâs taken
information historically and used it in ways that we didnât expect,
going all the way back, say, to the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. So, Iâm
hoping now we can have the discussion. I do believe there are sets of
safeguards where the government shouldnât have to be completely blind.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: That was Bill Gates speaking to Bloomberg News. Your response?
BARRY EISLER: Itâs interesting. Heâs so close to an epiphany. He talks
about J. Edgar Hoover. Maybe he knows about COINTELPRO. He
acknowledges that the government has abused powers that itâs been
given in the past. And so, you think heâs going in a certain direction
with this, and then he just comes up with this platitude, which is we
have to strike a balance. Like who doesnât think that we shouldnât
strike a balance? Itâs just meaningless. Thereâs no one who would say,
"I donât think we need a balance. I think itâs just one or the other."
So, I donât know. Maybe itâs not a coincidence that Microsoft is a
fading technology company and Apple is a premier one.
AMY GOODMAN: Microsoft has said that in the past, that 80 tech
companies have cooperatedâI mean, WikiLeaks has said that 80 tech
companies in the past have cooperated with the NSA, the National
Security Agency, including Microsoft.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, so much of theâof Snowdenâs revelations were about
this very thing. And the fact that the public knows about corporate
cooperation with the government now is in part, I think, what has
emboldened Apple to push back, because, again, if we didnât know about
these things, I would expect that Apple would be quietly cooperating.
There would be no cost to their doing so. But they realize now that
thereâs a significant constituency among their customers that wants
robust privacy features in Apple products, and to please those
customers, Apple realizes that in this public battle with the FBI, it
canât just roll over and serve the FBI; otherwise, it might turn into
the next Microsoft.
Part 2: Former CIA Agent Barry Eisler Turned Writer on
Imagining/Predicting Gov't Surveillance
February 25, 2016
In our extended conversation with Barry Eisler, a former CIA agent
turned writer, he discusses his political thrillers, most recently,
"The Godâs Eye View." "There have been a lot of things Iâve written
about that surprisingly turned out to be true," Eisler says. "If you
read the news ... and you use your imagination, you can read between
the lines in ways that will allow you to predict in somewhat
depressing fashion what the government is really up to."

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and
Peace Report. Iâm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, with Part 2 of our
interview with the thriller writer, The New York Times best-selling
author, Barry Eisler. His latest book is called The Godâs Eye View.
Now, while it is fiction, he had his own experiences within the CIA,
in the covert wing of the Central Intelligence Agency, so thereâs a
lot here. Well, you call it, Barry, reality-based.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: You have written a number of books, that have made it to
all levels of The New York Times best-seller list. And while at the
time they may have seemed speculative, so many of them have proven to
be true. Talk about A Clean Kill in Tokyo, which you published, what?
Like 13, 14 years ago?
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: Where you write about remotely hacking the pacemaker and
so many other things. And go through A Lonely Resurrection and Fault
Line and "London Twist," how what, you deem them, might be a little
futuristic actually panned out.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, there have been a lot of things Iâve written about
that, surprisingly and somewhat depressingly, have actually turned out
to be true. The one about hacking a pacemaker, I did in my first book
in 2002, turns out to be the case. I mentioned earlier Dick Cheney had
his doctor turn the wireless accessibility feature in his pacemaker
off. And thereâs been a lot ofâa lot of studies now about
vulnerability of not just medical devices, but of cars and even
airplanes, because everything is wired now.
Probably the closest I think Iâve ever come to something that turned
out to be true was in my third book, which I was writing in 2004.
Thereâs a CIA guy whoâs explaining to my contract assassin, John Rain,
that the government has this thing they call a list. Itâs a list of
terror targets, terrorist targets, that the government wants to take
out. And the guy, my CIA guy, Kanozaki, says, "Thereâsâof course
nobody calls this thing an assassination list. That would be gauche
and would be hard to explain in front of some outraged congressional
committee down the road. What we call it is a disposition list." And
then, a couple years ago, it turns out that the White House has Terror
Tuesdays, and what they call their assassination list is the
disposition matrix. I was like, "Damn! Iâm even getting theâIâm almost
getting the nomenclature right." But yeah, thatâs the government,
right? Theyâre never going to call it a kill list. In fact, we donât
even do assassinations. We have "targeted killings." There are so many
words like that, that the government uses to obscure whatâs really
going on. You know, if we wind up making another war in Libya, itâs
not going to be a war, it will just be an intervention. We never call
these things what they really are. So that was another one that I was
surprised to get right.
My second book, A Lonely Resurrection, published in 2003, I was
talking about Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, and the kind of
corruption and cover-ups they were using to conceal shoddy work on
their nuclear reactors. And then, of course, there was the 2011
tsunami and meltdown at Fukushima nuclear reactor, and it turned out
that, yeah, TEPCO was doing all this kind of stuff.
So, I tell people a lot of times that if you read the news, real news,
closely, if you watch shows like Democracy Now! and some other good
ones, and you use your imagination, you can read between the lines in
ways that will allow you to predict, in somewhat depressing fashion,
what the government is really up to.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about facial recognition?
BARRY EISLER: Yeah. Iâm no facial recognition expert, but there have
been some great articles about it. Kashmir Hill in Fusion wrote about
this about a year ago, and I used her article as part of my
bibliography. This technology gets better and better. I mean, itâsâif
you think about like speech recognition, 10 years ago, it was a little
bit kludgy; now itâs really, really good. Facial recognition is the
same. The biggest problem with facial recognition, as I understand it,
is false positives. So itâs hard to weed those out. But the technology
keeps getting more accurate.
And if you think about what will happen when facial recognitionâas
facial recognition technology grows increasingly robust and is paired
with the governmentâs efforts to hack into closed-circuit television
systems and all sorts of monitors, all sorts of camerasâfor example,
the ones on the laptops you guys have right here on your deskâyou
really might want to put stickies over those, over those cameras,
right?âbut when it gets to the point where the government has access
to cameras deployed in public spaces all over the world and pairs that
with facial recognition technology, weâre going to be living in a
world that is reminiscent of Minority Report. And if we do wind up
living in that world, as Edward Snowden was saying in a clip you
played earlier, I personally donât think that would be a good thing,
but at the very least, we ought to be able to make an informed
decision about that and vote on it as a democracy.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Youâve also said that no one serves up great plots for
thriller writers like the U.S. government.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, is the government the principal source of all of
these different books that youâve written?
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, yeah. As I say, itâs kind of depressing, again, as
an American citizen, but Iâm embarrassed also to admit that as a
thriller writer, every time the government does some crazy thing, Iâm
like, "Oh, my god! My next book!" I mean, when Glenn Greenwald and
Laura Poitras first started reporting on the Snowden revelations, I
was like, "This is it! This is my book!" So, thank you, Edward
Snowden. I mean, you helped me write a really great book.
I remember reading in 2002 when the CIA essentially took a public bow
for blowing up some suspected terroristsâwhich the government never
calls suspected terrorists, by the way; theyâre always just
terroristsâblowing up a car full of suspected terrorists in Yemen,
including an American citizen. And thatâs when I got the idea for this
list. I thought, "Wow! The rules have really changed post-9/11. The
government is now conducting assassinations"âsorry, targeted
killingsâ"of people, including American citizens. No due process
whatsoever, no judicial process. They must have some sort of list. Who
would they want to kill? How would my guy, John Rain, get involved?"
So, yeah, every time the government does a new crazy thing, itâs just
like another plot for another one of my books.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, Barry Eisler, we thank you for being with us and
for the latest book, The Godâs Eye View, New York Times best-selling
author and former CIA agent in the covert division of the CIA, Barry
Eisler. This is Democracy Now! Iâm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

Mexican Cartels and Wet Willies: The Story Behind 'Sicario'
Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt on their War-on-Drugs thriller: "This
is not a Mexico problem, it's an 'everybody' problem"
By David Fear September 28, 2015
If you want to get Benicio Del Toro riled up, bring up the subject of
revenge. It's not like you won't get a passionate reaction out of the
sleepy-eyed actor over a variety of different topics â say,
representations of Mexico in Hollywood moviemaking, or why a
minimalistic approach to acting is often more effective, or his skill
in giving "Wet Willies" (more on that in a bit). But when the subject
of vengeance comes up in regards to his new movie, the drug-cartel
thriller Sicario (playing in select theaters now and opening
nationwide on October 2nd), Del Toro suddenly sits up very straight on
the couch in his Toronto hotel room. He stops staring at the ceiling,
locks in and becomes completely engaged, intensely so.
"What's that old saying about taking the eye-for-an-eye thing to its
logical extreme," the actor asks rhetorically. "Everybody goes blind.
There are folks who'll watch this movie and go" â he adopts a John
Wayne voice â "'This is how you do it.' That's what the film is asking
here: What side are you on? Do you follow the rules of engagement, or
do you embrace vigilantism, because you think that's the only way to
get things done?" Del Toro jerks a thumb at his costar Emily Blunt,
who's lounging on the sofa next to him, nodding. "Me, I belong to her
character's side of the equation. There has to be law and order. Or
else you're fucked, man."
That metaphorical dish best served cold is embedded into Sicario's
genetic make-up from the very first set piece, in which Blunt's F.B.I.
agent watches her kidnap-response team get taken out by a
booby-trapped house. The promise of revenge is how she's recruited to
join a special-ops task force run by a fratboy intelligence spook,
played by Josh Brolin as a human shit-eating-grin â and why she finds
herself paired with Del Toro's mystery man, who's also motivated by
the promise of payback. (The actor has said in previous interviews
that after playing everything from a cop to Pablo Escobar in drug-war
flicks, the chance to explore "the angle of revenge" was partially
what attracted him to the role.) And the concept of revenge has long
been a recurring motif in filmmaker Denis Villenueve's work, from his
breakout work Incendies (2010) to his all-star meditation on
retribution, Prisoners (2013).
In the French-Canadian director's eyes, however, vengeance was just
one of the things about actor-turned screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's
script that made him sign on immediately. "The movie addresses what's
happening in Mexico right now, sure," he says, sitting down next to
his stars. "But it could have been set in the Middle East or Africa.
Because really, this is a film about America, and how the foreign
policies of the Western world reflect a notion that we're above the
law. We act like the rest of the world belong to us." He pauses before
adding, "Iâm including my home country in this group as well; you're
not off the hook, Canada. We in the West have a tendency to create
chaos. And that chaos does not improve things."
That chaos â or as Brolin's character refers to it in the movie, the
need for America's national security agencies to "shake the tree" â is
exemplified in the movie by highly questionable activities like
torturing mid-level cartel lieutenants and dispatching in-house
sicarios (an ancient Roman term that essentially translates as
"enforcer" or "hit man") to do off-the-books dirty work. Meanwhile,
drug lords are hanging mutilated bodies in the streets as warnings.
"Welcome to Juarez," Blunt's character is told; forced to navigate
these poles, she becomes, in the actress's words, "a moral person
caught in an amoral world, where having a sense of right and wrong is
considered weak instead of good."
As for her tour guide, Del Toro's Colombian tough guy with a
longstanding grudge and a license to kill, he's played as more of a
cypher â someone who's clearly in his element when literally calling
the shots during a tense firefight yet offers occasional glimpses of
being more than just another cold-blooded predator. The fact that he's
near-impossible to read was something Villeneuve and the actor
admitted was purposeful; the latter even went so far to make him
extremely lone-wolf cryptic that he kept jettisoning pages of his
dialogue. "There was this big monologue that my guy had about his past
..." Del Toro says.
"It was this whole speech he tells my character after he saves her
life, right?" Blunt interjects.
"Exactly, yeah, and it's only after he's known her for, like two
days," he continues. "So I told Denis, look:  In my experience, nobody
opens up like that about their darkness to somebody after they've just
met ... much less some guy who's a professional killer. So he let me
get rid of a huge chunk of dialogue. You know how some actors count
their lines?" Del Toro adopts a tone that can only be described as
petulant-young-movie-star. "'He got 48 lines and I got 22 lines? Who
the fuck does he think he is?' I'm the opposite of that. Give me less
things to say. Let the silences say more."
"Then he made me give all those lines to Josh," Villeneuve says.
"'Hey, Denis, I don't want this dialogue â just, like, make Brolin do
it!'" Blunt adds.
"Every morning, I'd knock on Josh's trailer door, and I'd hear, 'What
the fuck does Benicio not want to say today?'" the director chimes in.
"He still fucking blames me!" Del Toro cries.
"Clearly, there's a reason Josh isn't in this interview right now,"
Blunt jokes. "You'd just be moderating a fight."
But the director says he tends to agree with his star on the
silence-is-golden point: Filmmaking is an art form that relies more on
presence than prose, he claims. And if someone can speak volumes in a
glance or a gesture without saying a word â or if cinematographer
Roger Deakins can suggest menace and moral ambiguity by letting the
camera slowly creep-glide into a performer's personal space (what
Villeneuve calls the visual equivalent of "putting pressure on your
characters") â he'd much rather do that. Besides, he adds, Sicario may
be a thriller, but it's also a film that deals with an ongoing issue
that can't be summed up in a few climactic soliloquies. The only worry
was that the lack of speechifying might lead some to think they were
enforcing south-of-the-border stereotypes that have burrowed their way
into pop culture.
"Yeah, see, now you're talking about the tricky subject of
representation â or rather, misrepresentation," Del Toro says, leaning
in. "That was the last thing any of us wanted. We showed this movie to
an audience the other day, and someone said during the Q&A, 'Well, now
I never want to go to Mexico.'" He shakes his head. "Not every taxi
driver is Travis Bickle. Not everybody in Queens acts like they're in
Goodfellas, you know? Denis is right when he says the film is about
America, but it does take place in country that has been portrayed
recently in a very negative way. Then you've got Donald Trump saying
all this stuff about our borders â¦"
"You don't want to suggest that Mexico is one huge violent wasteland,"
Blunt adds, "any more than you'd want people to think Donald Trump
speaks for all Americans."
"But there's hope, right?" Del Toro asks. "It's gotten really bad in a
place like Juarez, but if you look at what happened in Bogata,
Colombia â¦ that place has turned. It had a huge problem and it's
gotten a little bit better. I'm not a scholar on the situation, by any
means â but from what I understand, people just had enough. They came
out and demanded that somebody do something about it. The musician
RubÃ©n Blades wrote this letter after what happened in Iguala,
Guerrero, when 43 students disappeared. Apparently, there was a
connection between the government, the police department and the drug
cartels that caused this to happen. And he said something along the
lines of: This is not a "Mexico" problem. Itâs an "everybody" problem.
This isn't a political movie. But we have to make this problem stop."
Villeneuve and his stars are about to leave to introduce the film's
North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival
when the subject of Del Toro's impromptu interrogation techniques
comes up â specifically, whether a scene involving his character
wetting his index finger than sticking it deep into a criminal's ear â
was improvised.
"Was the 'Wet Willie' bit improvised," Del Toro says scratching his chin.
"What's a Wet Willie?" Villenueve asks.
"Oh, he just went around the set giving those to everyone," Blunt says.
"That's how Emily and I got to be such close friends," Del Toro jokes,
before he and Blunt start giving each other ice-cold stares. "I'll get
you for saying that," she adds, before the three them break and start
cracking up.

@_subject: FBI disruption strategies - extra-judicial life destruction 
Disruption strategy involves âa range of tools including arrests,
interviews, or source-directed operations to effectively disrupt
subjectâs activities.â
âThe FBIâs overbroad and aggressive use of its investigative and
surveillance powers, and its willingness to employ âdisruption
strategiesâ against subjects not charged with crimes can have serious,
adverse impacts on innocent Americans,â the ACLU concluded.
âBeing placed under investigation creates an intense psychological,
and often financial, burden on the people under the microscope and
their families, even when they are never charged with a crime,â it
continued. âAll the more so when a heinous crime like terrorism is
alleged, and when the investigators are convinced the subject of their
investigation is guilty but they just donât have the evidence
necessary for arrest.â
The Congressional Research Service report noted that such methods are
reminiscent of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, and particularly the
COINTELPRO program, which engaged in âpreventive, covert,
intelligence-based efforts to target and contain people, groups, or
movements suspected by the Bureau to be ârabble rousers,â âagitators,â
âkey activists,â or âkey black extremists.ââ The FBI ârelied on
illegal means to curb constitutionally protected activity it deemed
threatening to national security.â
FBI Wonât Explain Its Bizarre New Way of Measuring Its Success Fighting Terror
Jenna McLaughlin
Feb. 18 2016, 11:18 p.m.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has quietly developed a new way to
measure its success in the war on terror: counting the number of
terror threats it has âdisruptedâ in a year.
But good luck trying to figure out what that number means, how it was
derived, or why it doesnât jibe with any other law enforcement
statistic, most notably, the number of terror suspects actually
charged or arrested.
In the section on âPerformance Measuresâ in the FBIâs latest financial
statement, the bureau reports 440 âterror disruptionsâ in the 12-month
period ending on September 30, 2015. Thatâs compared to 214 in fiscal
year 2014. And itâs more than three times the 2015 âtargetâ of 125.
In a vacuum, that would appear to suggest that the FBIâs
terror-fighting mission â which sucked up $5.3 billion, or 54 percent
of the bureauâs $9.8 billion budget in 2015 â is exceeding
But that number â 440 â is much higher than the number of arrests
reported by the FBI. The Washington Post counted about 60
terror-related arrests in 2015; a study by George Washington
University found 71 arrests related to the Islamic State from March
2014 to the end of 2015.
Of those arrests, many were of people trying to travel abroad or
trying to help others do so. Many more involved people planning
attacks that were essentially imaginary, often goaded by FBI
And according to a document from the Department of Homeland Security
obtained by The Intercept in November, there was only one genuinely
âfoiled attackâ in the United States between January 2014 and
September 2015. And that one, involving would-be shooters in Garland,
Texas, targeting a cartoon-drawing event inspired by the Prophet
Muhammad, was stopped by the local police department.
The FBI didnât respond to emails asking basic questions such as what
qualifies as a disruption, why the number is so much higher than the
bureauâs recorded arrests, or how it comes up with its annual
In a January 2015 Performance Report, Justice Department officials
explained that the âtargets reflect the number of expected disruptions
based on the estimated threat, yet account for potential
The officials acknowledged that âdisruptions can be a challenge to
quantify for future yearsâ because the number of potential plots is
 âBased on past
data trends, coupled with current and emerging threat pictures, the
FBI expects to achieve its FY 2015 and FY 2016 targets.â
A strange way to provide transparency
The âterrorism threat disruptionsâ metric is a relatively new arbiter
of success for the FBI. In a 2013 Department of Justice document about
strategic goals, fighting terrorism is identified as Strategic Goal 1,
and ânumber of terrorism disruptionsâ is Strategic Objective 1.1.
âTo provide transparency to its work in the area of counterterrorism,
the Department will disclose a key statistic: the number of terrorism
disruptions,â the department announced.
But the definition was vague: âA disruption is defined as interrupting
or inhibiting a threat actor from engaging in criminal or national
security related activity. A disruption is the result of direct
actions and may include but is not limited to the arrest; seizure of
assets; or impairing the operational capabilities of key threat
And the departmentâs idea of transparency was problematic. Because the
FBIâs âoperational priorities are classified,â the document noted, âit
is only possible to report aggregate data that lacks significant
Experts interviewed by The Intercept suggested two possible
explanations for the high number of terror disruptions.
Gold stars
One possibility, they said, is that the number is just a subjective
way to make people at the FBI look good, or to rationalize the cost.
âThis is how the whole career system works in the FBI â statistics,
performance,â said Coleen Rowley, a former FBI agent and
whistleblower. Individuals use statistics to advance their careers,
and the agency, in turn, uses them to justify its budget, she said.
âIn the agency, this is the way to advance.â
The fact that the agency establishes a target for terrorism
disruptions is also troubling, said Michael German, a former FBI agent
and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice. âThat the FBI actually
sets a performance goal stating the specific number of terrorist
disruptions it wants to accomplish over the year would seem to create
an incentive to gin up cases where no real threat might exist.â
And if the number is inflated, it wouldnât be the first time the
Department of Justice or the FBI had been criticized for inaccurately
estimating the impact of their counterterrorism efforts.
In 2007, an inspector general investigation found that the entire
Department of Justice â the FBI included â had messed up its
bookkeeping efforts on terrorism. The FBI mistakenly included marriage
fraud, immigration cases, and others in their records of anti-terror
And in 2013, Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz called out the
office that oversees U.S. attorneyâs offices for shoddy reporting that
significantly overstated the number of terrorism convictions, counting
cases that actually dealt with narcotics or money laundering or
including defendants who had their charges dismissed.
âThese inaccuracies are important in part because DOJ management and
Congress need accurate terrorism-related statistics to make informed
operational and budgetary decisions,â Horowitz said in a statement
accompanying the 2013 report.
Easier to disrupt than arrest
Another possible explanation for such a big number, however, is that
it accurately reflects a new FBI approach to fighting terror that is
occurring outside of public view â where the bureau decides someone is
a threat and disrupts his or her life in some way that isnât nearly as
subject to oversight and accountability as an indictment or an arrest.
âIâm sensing a significant change in counterterrorism policy in the
U.S., where weâve gone from âwatch and report,â to âletâs just disrupt
them any way we can,ââ David Gomez, a former FBI agent and profiler,
as well as a former LAPD officer, told The Intercept. âThis has cut
short the way the FBI does long-term investigations. â¦ Theyâre not
doing that anymore.â
The FBI has indeed been going through some changes.
As a 2013 Congressional Research Service report explains, âSince the
September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, the FBI has implemented a series of
reforms intended to transform itself from a largely reactive law
enforcement agency focused on investigations of criminal activity into
a more proactive, agile, flexible, and intelligence-driven agency that
can prevent acts of terrorism.â
This has led law enforcement agencies to use aggressive, proactive
techniques to catch potential terrorists before a crime is committed.
According to the CRS report, one technique is the âAl Caponeâ approach
â putting people in jail for a minor crime rather than sticking around
and waiting for evidence of a serious violent threat.
Another method is the informant, or âagent provocateur,â who starts
communicating with potential suspects, goading them into committing an
act of terrorism in order to catch them in the act.
âWhere the person targeted really is a terrorist, that might make
sense,â said German. âBut often when evidence that a person is a
terrorist is lacking â thatâs because he isnât a terrorist.â
German, in an email, asked: âHas the FBI secretly prevented people
from getting jobs, hazmat licenses, gun permits, security clearances,
or barred their travel where no charges were brought, providing no
opportunity for them to challenge the accusations against them or
prove their innocence? And then chalked that up as a successful
âdisruptionâ so they would get a pat on the back and more resources
from Congress, regardless of whether the person was actually guilty?â
A 2009 FBI document obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union
explicitly allows field offices to engage in âdisruption strategiesâ
at the conclusion of a terror assessment or investigation, after âall
significant intelligence has been collected, and/or the threat is
otherwise resolved.â Disruption strategy involves âa range of tools
including arrests, interviews, or source-directed operations to
effectively disrupt subjectâs activities.â
âThe FBIâs overbroad and aggressive use of its investigative and
surveillance powers, and its willingness to employ âdisruption
strategiesâ against subjects not charged with crimes can have serious,
adverse impacts on innocent Americans,â the ACLU concluded.
âBeing placed under investigation creates an intense psychological,
and often financial, burden on the people under the microscope and
their families, even when they are never charged with a crime,â it
continued. âAll the more so when a heinous crime like terrorism is
alleged, and when the investigators are convinced the subject of their
investigation is guilty but they just donât have the evidence
necessary for arrest.â
The Congressional Research Service report noted that such methods are
reminiscent of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, and particularly the
COINTELPRO program, which engaged in âpreventive, covert,
intelligence-based efforts to target and contain people, groups, or
movements suspected by the Bureau to be ârabble rousers,â âagitators,â
âkey activists,â or âkey black extremists.ââ The FBI ârelied on
illegal means to curb constitutionally protected activity it deemed
threatening to national security.â
The goal of âdisruptionâ has typically been reserved for FBI agents
pursuing people like drug traffickers â where âimpeding the normal and
effective operation of the targeted organization, as indicated by
changes in the organizational leadership and/or changes in methods of
operation,â counts as disruption.
But that standard doesnât really apply to the âlone wolvesâ or small
groups that make up most of the FBIâs terror suspects.
Great expectations
The FBI is under a lot of pressure these days â charged with
preventing every possible terrorist attack before it happens, while
withstanding public scrutiny of its methods.
Gomez, the former FBI agent, cuts the bureau some slack. âAs a
policeman, we used to have a saying about local drug dealers â we put
them in jail for everything, use of heroin, a misdemeanor,â Gomez
said. âTheyâre doing life in prison 60 days at a time.â
The FBI is âgoing to be under severe criticismâ one way or the other,
he said. âYou canât win.â
Rowley, though critical of the strategy, said she was also
sympathetic. âItâs a bad position of, oh, you better prevent every act
of terrorism,â she said.

Snowdenâs Chronicler Reveals Her Own Life Under Surveillance
     Andy Greenberg	Security Date of Publication: 02.04.16.
    02.04.16
    Time of Publication: 9:03 am.
    9:03 am
Laura Poitras has a talent for disappearing. In her early
documentaries like My Country, My Country and The Oath, her camera
seems to float invisibly in rooms where subjects carry on intimate
conversations as if theyâre not being observed. Even in Citizenfour,
the Oscar-winning film that tracks her personal journey from first
contact with Edward Snowden to releasing his top secret NSA leaks to
the world, she rarely offers a word of narration. She appears in that
film exactly once, caught as if by accident in the mirror of Snowdenâs
Hong Kong hotel room.
Now, with the opening of her multi-media solo exhibit, Astro Noise, at
New Yorkâs Whitney Museum of American Art this week, Snowdenâs
chronicler has finally turned her lens onto herself. And sheâs given
us a glimpse into one of the darkest stretches of her life, when she
wasnât yet the revelator of modern American surveillance but instead
its target.
The exhibit is vast and unsettling, ranging from films to documents
that can be viewed only through wooden slits to a video expanse of
Yemeni sky which visitors are invited to lie beneath. But the most
personal parts of the show are documents that lay bare how
excruciating life was for Poitras as a target of government
surveillanceâand how her subsequent paranoia made her the ideal
collaborator in Snowdenâs mission to expose Americaâs surveillance
state. First, sheâs installed a wall of papers that she received in
response to an ongoing Freedom of Information lawsuit the Electronic
Frontier Foundation filed on her behalf against the FBI. The documents
definitively show why Poitras was tracked and repeatedly searched at
the US border for years, and even that she was the subject of a grand
jury investigation. And second, a book sheâs publishing to accompany
the exhibit includes her journal from the height of that surveillance,
recording her first-person experience of becoming a spying subject,
along with her inner monologue as she first corresponded with the
secret NSA leaker she then knew only as âCitizenfour.â
Poitras says she initially intended to use only a few quotes from her
journal in that book. But as she was transcribing it, she ârealized
that it was a primary source document about navigating a certain
reality,â she says. The finished book, which includes a biographical
piece by Guantanamo detainee Lakhdar Boumediene, a photo collection
from Ai Weiwei, and a short essay by Snowden on using radio waves from
stars to generate random data for encryption, is subtitled âA Survival
Guide for Living Under Total Surveillance.â It will be published
widely on February 23.
âIâve asked people for a long time to reveal a lot in my films,â
Poitras says. But telling her own story, even in limited glimpses,
âprovides a concrete example of how the process works we donât usually
That process, for Poitras, is the experience of being unwittingly
ingested into the American surveillance system.
On the Governmentâs Radar
Poitras has long suspected that her targeting began after she filmed
an Iraqi family in Baghdad for the documentary My Country, My Country.
Now sheâs sure, because the documents released by her Freedom of
Information Act request prove it. During a 2004 ambush by Iraqi
insurgents in which an American soldier died and several others were
injured, she came out onto the roof of the familyâs home to film them
as they watched events unfolding on the street below. She shot for a
total of eight minutes and 16 seconds. The resulting footage, which
she shows in the Whitney exhibit, reveals nothing related to either
American or insurgent military positions.
âThose eight minutes changed my life, though I didnât know it at the
time,â she says in an audio narration that plays around the documents
in her exhibition. âAfter returning to the United States I was placed
on a government watchlist and detained and searched every time I
crossed the US border. It took me ten years to find out why.â

A Whitney Museum visitor looking at a selection of Poitrasâ FOIAed
documents framed in a collection of light boxes. Andy Greenberg
The heavily redacted documents show that the US Army Criminal
Investigation Command requested in 2006 that the FBI investigate
Poitras as a possible âU.S. media representative â¦ involved with
anti-coalition forces.â According to the FBI file, a member of the
Oregon National Guard serving in Iraq identified Poitras and âa local
[Iraqi] leaderââthe father of the family that would become the subject
of her film. The soldier, whose name was redacted, questioned Poitras
at the time, and reported that she âbecame significantly nervousâ and
denied filming from the roof. He later told the Army investigators
that he âstrongly believedââbut without apparent evidenceââPOITRAS had
prior knowledge of the ambush and had the means to report it to U.S.
Forces; however, she purposely did not report it so she could film the
attack for her documentary.â
One page shown in the Whitney exhibit reveals that the New York field
office of the FBI was tracking Poitrasâ home addresses, and Poitras
believes the reference to a âdetectiveâ working with the FBI indicates
the New York Police Department may have also been involved. By 2007,
the documents reveal that there was a grand jury investigation
proceeding on whether to indict her for unnamed crimesâmultiple
subpoenas sought information about her from redacted sources. (Poitras
says that the twelve pages she published in the Whitney exhibition are
only a selection of 800 documents sheâs received in her FOIA lawsuit,
which is ongoing.)
Being Constantly Watched
Private as ever, Poitras declined to detail to WIRED exactly how she
experienced that federal investigation in the years that followed. But
flash forward to late 2012, and the surveillance targeting Poitras had
transformed her into a nervous wreck. In the book, she shares a diary
she kept during her time living in Berlin, in which she describes
feeling constantly watched, entirely robbed of privacy. âI havenât
written in over a year for fear these words are not private,â are the
journalâs first words. âThat nothing in my life can be kept private.â
She sleeps badly, plagued with nightmares about the American
government. She reads Cory Doctorowâs Homeland and re-reads 1984,
finding too many parallels with her own life. She notes her computer
glitching and âgoing pinkâ during her interviews with NSA
whistleblower William Binney, and that it tells her its hard drive is
full despite seeming to have 16 gigabytes free. Eventually she moves
to a new apartment that she attempts to keep âoff the radarâ by
avoiding all cell phones and only accessing the Internet over the
anonymity software Tor.
When Snowden contacts her in January of 2013, Poitras has lived with
the specter of spying long enough that she initially wonders if he
might be part of a plan to entrap her or her contacts like Julian
Assange or Jacob Appelbaum, an activist and Tor developer. âIs C4 a
trap?â she asks herself, using an abbreviation of Snowdenâs codename.
âWill he put me in prison?â
Even once she decides heâs a legitimate source, the pressure threatens
to overwhelm her. The stress becomes visceral: She writes that she
feels like sheâs âunderwaterâ and that she can hear the blood rushing
through her body. âI am battling with my nervous system,â she writes.
âIt doesnât let me rest or sleep. Eye twitches, clenched throat, and
now literally waiting to be raided.â
Finally she decides to meet Snowden and to publish his top secret
leaks, despite her fears of both the risks to him and to herself. Both
the journal and the documents she obtained from the government show
how her own targeting helped to galvanize her resolve to expose the
apparatus of surveillance. âHe is prepared for the consequences of the
disclosure,â she writes, then admits: âI really donât want to become
the story.â
In the end, Poitras has not only escaped the arrest or indictment she
feared, but has become a kind of privacy folk hero: Her work has
helped to noticeably shift the worldâs view of government spying, led
to legislation, and won both a Pulitzer and an Academy Award. But if
her ultimate fear was to âbecome the story,â her latest revelations
show thatâs a fate she can no longer escapeâand one sheâs come to
Poitrasâ Astro Noise exhibit runs from February 5 until May 1 at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, and the accompanying book will be
published on February 23.

The Social Construction of Trust in Cryptographic Systems
3 February 2016
(This is an extract from my contribution to Harper, Richard.
âIntroduction and Overviewâ, Trust, Computing, and Society. Ed.
Richard H. R. Harper. 1st ed. New York: Cambridge University Press,
2014. pp. 3-14. Cambridge Books Online. Web. 03 February 2016.
Cryptography has been used for centuries to secure military,
diplomatic, and commercial communications that may fall into the hands
of enemies and competitors (Kahn 1996). Traditional cryptography
concerns itself with a simple problem: Alice wants to send a message
to Bob over some communication channel that may be observed by Eve,
but without Eve being able to read the content of the message. To do
this, Alice and Bob share a short key, say a passphrase or a poem.
Alice then uses this key to scramble (or encrypt) the message, using a
cipher, and sends the message to Bob. Bob is able to use the shared
key to invert the scrambling (or âdecryptâ) and recover the message.
The hope is that Eve, without the knowledge of the key, will not be
able to unscramble the message, thus preserving its confidentiality.
It is important to note that in this traditional setting we have not
removed the need for a secure channel. The shared key needs to be
exchanged securely, because its compromise would allow Eve to read
messages. Yet, the hope is that the key is much shorter than the
messages subsequently exchanged, and thus easier to transport securely
once (by memorizing it or by better physical security). What about the
cipher? Should the method by which the key and the message are
combined not be kept secret? In âLa Cryptographie Militaireâ in 1883,
Auguste Kerckhoffs stated a number of principles, including that only
the key should be considered secret, not the cipher method itself
(Kerckhoffs 1883). Both the reliance on a small key and the fact that
other aspects of the system are public is an application of the
minimization principle we have already seen in secure system
engineering. It is by minimizing what has to be trusted for the
security policy to hold that one can build and verify secure systems â
in the context of traditional cryptography, in principle, this is just
a short key.
Kerckhoffs argues that only the key, not the secrecy of the cipher is
in the trusted computing base. But a key property of the cipher is
relied on: Eve must not be able to use an encrypted message and
knowledge of the cipher to recover the message without access to the
secret key. This is very different from previous security assumptions
or components of the TCB. It is not about the physical restrictions on
Eve, and it is not about the logical operations of the computer
software and hardware that could be verified by careful inspection. It
comes down to an assumption that Eve cannot solve a somehow difficult
mathematical problem. Thus, how can you trust a cipher? How can you
trust that the adversary cannot solve a mathematical problem?
To speak the truth, this was not a major concern until relatively
recently, compared with the long history of cryptography. Before
computers, encoding and decoding had to be performed by hand or using
electromechanical machines. Concerns such as usability, speed, cost of
the equipment, and lack of decoding errors were the main concerns in
choosing a cipher. When it comes to security, it was assumed that if a
âclever personâ proposes a cipher, then it would take someone much
cleverer than them to decode it. It was even sometimes assumed that
ciphers were of such complexity that there was âno wayâ to decode
messages without the key. The assumption that other nations may not
have a supply of âcleverâ people may have to do with a colonial
ideology of nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Events leading
to the 1950s clearly contradict this: ciphers used by major military
powers were often broken by their opponents.
In 1949, Claude Shannon set out to define what a perfect cipher would
be. He wanted it to be âimpossibleâ to solve the mathematical problem
underlying the cipher (Shannon 1949). The results of this seminal work
are mixed. On the positive side, there is a perfect cipher that, no
matter how clever an adversary is, cannot be solved â the one-time
pad. On the down side, the key of the cipher is as long as the
message, must be absolutely random, and can only be used once.
Therefore the advantage of short keys, in terms of minimizing their
exposure, is lost and the cost of generating keys is high (avoiding
bias in generating random keys is harder than expected). Furthermore,
Shannon proves that any cipher with smaller keys cannot be perfectly
secure. Because the one-time pad is not practical in many cases, how
can one trust a cipher with short keys, knowing that its security
depends on the complexity of finding a solution? For about thirty
years, the United States and the UK followed a very pragmatic approach
to this: they kept the cryptological advances of World War II under
wraps; they limited the export of cryptographic equipment and know-how
through export regulations; and their signal intelligence agencies â
the NSA and GCHQ, respectively â became the largest worldwide
employers of mathematicians and the largest customers of
supercomputers. Additionally, in their roles in eavesdropping on their
enemiesâ communications, they evaluated the security of the systems
used to protect government communications. The assurance in
cryptography came at the cost of being the largest organizations that
know about cryptography in the world.
The problem with this arrangement is that it relies on a monopoly of
knowledge around cryptology. Yet, as we have seen with the advent of
commercial telecommunications, cryptography becomes important for
nongovernment uses. Even the simplest secure remote authentication
mechanism requires some cryptography if it is to be used over insecure
channels. Therefore, keeping cryptography under wraps is not an
option: in 1977, the NSA approved the IBM design for a public cipher,
the Data Encryption Standard (DES), for public use. It was
standardized in 1979 by the US National Institute for Standards and
Technology (NIST).
The publication of DES launched a wide interest in cryptography in the
public academic community. Many people wanted to understand how it
works and why it is secure. Yet, the fact that the NSA tweaked its
design, for undisclosed reasons, created widespread suspicion in the
cipher. The fear was that a subtle flaw was introduced to make
decryption easy for intelligence agencies. It is fair to say that many
academic cryptographers did not trust DES!
Another important innovation in 1976 was presented by Whitfield Diffie
and Martin Hellman in their work âNew Directions in Cryptographyâ
(Diffie & Hellman 1976). They show that it is possible to preserve the
confidentiality of a conversation over a public channel, without
sharing a secret key! This is today known as âPublic Key
Cryptography,â because it relies on Alice knowing a public key for
Bob, shared with anyone in the world, and using it to encrypt a
message. Bob has the corresponding private part of the key, and is the
only one that can decode messages used with the public key. In 1977,
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman proposed a further system,
the RSA, that also allowed for the equivalent of âdigital signaturesâ
(Rivest et al. 1978).
What is different in terms of trusting public key cryptography versus
traditional ciphers? Both the Diffie-Hellman system and the RSA system
base their security on number theoretic problems. For example, RSA
relies on the difficulty of factoring integers with two very large
factors (hundreds of digits). Unlike traditional ciphers â such as DES
â that rely on many layers of complex problems, public key algorithms
base their security on a handful of elegant number theoretic problems.
Number theory, a discipline that G.H. Hardy argued at the beginning of
the twentieth century was very pure in terms of its lack of any
practical application (Hardy & Snow 1967), quickly became the deciding
factor on whether one can trust the most significant innovation in the
history of cryptology! As a result, a lot of interest and funding
directed academic mathematicians to study whether the mathematical
problems underpinning public key cryptography were in fact difficult
and how difficult the problems were.
Interestingly, public key cryptography does not eliminate the need to
totally trust the keys. Unlike traditional cryptography, there is no
need for Bob to share a secret key with Alice to receive confidential
communications. Instead, Bob needs to keep the private key secret and
not share it with anyone else. Maintaining the confidentiality of
private keys is simpler than sharing secret keys safely, but it is far
from trivial given their long-term nature. What needs to be shared is
Bobâs public key. Furthermore, Alice need to be sure she is using the
public key associated with the Bobâs private key; if Eve convinces
Alice to use an arbitrary public key to encrypt a message to Bob, then
Eve could decrypt all messages.
The need to securely associate public keys with entities has been
recognized early on. Diffie and Hellman proposed to publish a book, a
bit like the phone register, associating public keys with people. In
practice, a public key infrastructure is used to do this: trusted
authorities, like Verisign, issue digital certificates to attest that
a particular key corresponds to a particular Internet address. These
authorities are in charge of ensuring that the identity, the keys, and
their association are correct. The digital certificates are âsignedâ
using the signature key of the authorities that anyone can verify.
The use of certificate authorities is not a natural architecture in
many cases. If Alice and Bob know each other, they can presumably use
another way to ensure Alice knows the correct public key for Bob.
Similarly, if a software vendor wants to sign updates for their own
software, they can presumably embed the correct public key into it,
instead of relying on public key authorities to link their own key
with their own identity.
The use of public key infrastructures (PKI) is necessary in case Alice
wants to communicate with Bob without them having any previous
relationship. In that case Alice, given only a valid name for Bob, can
establish a private channel to Bob (as long as it trusts the PKI).
This is often confused: the PKI ensures that Alice talks to Bob, but
not that Bob is âtrustworthyâ in any other way. For example, a Web
browser can establish a secure channel to a Web service that is
compromised or simply belong to the mafia. The secrecy provided by the
channel does not, in that case, provide any guarantees as to the
operation of the Web service. Recently, PKI services and browsers have
tried to augment their services by only issuing certificates to
entities that are verified as somehow legitimate.
Deferring the link between identities and public keys to trusted third
parties places this third party in a systemâs TCB. Can certification
authorities be trusted to support your security policy? In some ways,
no. As implemented in current browsers, any certification authority
(CA) can sign a digital certificate for any site on the Internet
(Ellison & Schneier 2000). This means that a rogue national CA (say,
from Turkey) can sign certificates for the U.S. State Department, that
browsers will believe. In 2011, the Dutch certificate authority
Diginotar was hacked, and their secret signature key was stolen
(Fox-IT 2012). As a result, fake certificates were issued for a number
of sensitive sites. Do CAs have incentives to protect their key? Do
they have enough incentives to check the identity of the people or
entities behind the certificates they sign?
Cryptographic primitives like ciphers and digital signatures have been
combined in a variety of protocols. One of the most famous is the
Secure Socket Layer SSL or TLS, which provides encryption to access
encrypted Web sites on the Internet (all sites following the https://
protocol). Interestingly, once secure primitives are combined into
larger protocols, their composition is not guaranteed to be secure.
For example a number of problems have been identified against SSL and
TLS that are not related to the weaknesses of the basic ciphers used
(Vaudenay 2002).
The observation that cryptographic schemes are brittle and could be
insecure even if they rely on secure primitives (as did many deployed
protocols) led to a crisis within cryptologic research circles. The
school of âprovable securityâ proposes that rigorous proofs of
security should accompany any cryptographic protocol to ensure it is
secure. In fact âprovable securityâ is a bit of a misnomer: the basic
building blocks of cryptography, namely public key schemes and ciphers
cannot be proved secure, as Shannon argued. So a security proof is
merely a reduction proof: it shows that any weakness in the complex
cryptographic scheme can be reduced to a weakness in one of the
primitives, or a well-recognized cryptographic hardness assumption. It
effectively proves that a complex cryptographic scheme reduces to the
security of a small set of cryptographic components, not unlike
arguments about a small Trusted Computing Base. Yet, even those proofs
of security often work at a certain level of abstraction and often do
not include all details of the protocol. Furthermore, not all
properties can be described in the logic used to perform the proofs.
As a result, even provably secure protocols have been found to have
weaknesses (Pfitzmann & Waidner 1992).
So, the question of âHow much can you trust cryptography?â has in part
itself been reduced to âHow much can you trust the correctness of a
mathematical proof on a model of the world?â and âHow much can one
trust that a correct proof in a model applies to the real world?â
These are deep epistemological questions, and it is somehow ironic
that national, corporate, and personal security depends on them. In
addition to these, one may have to trust certificate authorities and
assumptions on the hardness of deep mathematical problems. Therefore,
it is fair to say that trust in cryptographic mechanisms is an
extremely complex social process.

The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Prison
The Rule of Law Enforcement
Barrett Brown
Feb. 2 2016, 3:02 p.m.
AFTER HAVING SPENT the prior six months in a fruitless cycle of
retaliation and counter-retaliation and counter-counter-retaliation
with the administration of the Federal Correctional Institution at
Fort Worth, where I managed to do about half of my time in the hole
before finally getting kicked out altogether, I was delighted to
arrive here at FCI Three Rivers, a medium security prison subject to
occasional outbreaks of gang warfare that also happens to be quite a
lot of fun. And though oneâs first few days at a new prison are always
given over largely to errands and social obligations, I did manage to
get in some much-needed reading time when someone lent me a copy of
Five Families, a history of the American mafia by the veteran New York
Times crime reporter Selwyn Raab. Iâve never had much interest in
organized crime of the non-governmental sort, but ever since 2009 when
I read through the bulk of Thomas Friedmanâs past columns in the
course of researching a book on the subject of incompetence, Iâve been
fascinated by the extent to which a fellow can be a bit of a dummy,
with questionable writing abilities and a penchant for making
demonstrably erroneous attacks on others, and still find regular
employment with the nationâs most prestigious newspaper (though in
fairness to the Times, they did eventually get rid of William
Iâm afraid I gave up on reading Five Families straight through after
about the halfway mark, by which point it had become clear that Raab,
contrary to all decency, was going to continue using the phrase
âlaw-enforcementâ thusly, with the unwarranted hyphen, something that
would have been more tolerable did the term not necessarily appear
every few pages due to the nature of the subject matter, often in the
company of such other improprieties as âcivil-rights,â
âpublic-relations,â âstolen-car rings,â or âloan-shark,â and to such
an extent that one could be forgiven for suspecting that Raab himself,
for all his tough talk on crime, is in fact some sort of illicit
hyphen smuggler.
Luckily, this is the sort of book from which one can extract the most
telling instances of Gray Lady-caliber foolishness just by skimming
around. At some point Raab seems to decide that the writers of The
Sopranos must be punished for humanizing the mafia in the course of
writing a drama about human beings who are in the mafia. And so, more
in sadness than in anger, but more in confusion than either, he set
out to debunk the showâs fictional plotline by way of his own
fictional journalistic expertise: âGenuine capos and wiseguys would
never emulate Tonyâs behavior. â¦ No top-tier mobster would last long
if he behaved like Tony Soprano, who defies basic Mafioso caution by
exposing himself as a ripe target, to be easily mowed down by rivals.
He drives without a bodyguard; sips espresso in daylight at a sidewalk
cafÃ©.â This comes just a few chapters after weâre told the following
about a real-life top-tier mobster: âShunning bodyguards and
bullet-proof limousines, the sixty-six-year-old godfather met with his
Mafia associates in restaurants and travelled about Manhattan in taxis
like any ordinary businessman.â
To his credit, Raab did manage to refrain from rendering this last bit
as âordinary-businessman,â which is just extraordinary, so weâll give
him another try: âSex and psychiatry are prominent in The Sopranosâ
story line. Confiding in a psychiatrist, however, would be a
radioactive mistake for a boss or capo, who can never display symptoms
of weakness or mental instability.â Naturally Raab has already
forgotten having written the following about mafia boss Frank
Costello: âStriving for inner peace while hovering between criminal
affiliates and respected society, Costello tried psychoanalysis.â
Even had the author not been so sporting as to provide us with
comically perfect counterexamples by which to disprove his various
inane objections, one could have also pointed out that Tony Sopranoâs
decision to see a psychiatrist does in fact prove to be a âmistakeâ
insomuch as that it directly leads to a rupture in his organization
culminating in a botched assassination attempt in the very first
season, so this objection wouldnât have made any sense even had it
gotten past that crucial
directly-contradicted-by-your-own-fucking-book hurdle that seems to be
giving Raab so much trouble. Now take a moment to reflect on the fact
that this is the guy the New York Times assigned to report on one of
the nationâs most complex and insidious criminal conspiracies â this
plodding hyphen addict who cannot seem to follow a television show or
even his own manuscript. One supposes that there is some alternate
universe in which this might be considered a problem and where Ross
Douthat manages a furniture store and everyone knows his place.
BUT THEREâS MORE to prison life than just sitting around despising the
New York Times. A week after arrival at Three Rivers, we new inmates
were summoned to an âAdmissions and Orientationâ seminar in which the
various department heads each speak for a few minutes about
institutional policy. Iâd attended one of these back at Fort Worth;
usually the highlight is a short video clip of Bureau of Prisons
Director Charles Samuels, who gives a little talk. No one knows what
the talk is about, as whoeverâs nephew was put in charge of producing
the video has talked Samuels into pausing every couple of sentences to
shift position and look into the other camera, just like the
newscasters, something that the fellow can manage only with the most
hilarious awkwardness, and so it proves impossible to follow what heâs
actually saying â which is a shame, as itâs almost certainly something
very non-formulaic and true.
Today, however, the chief attraction was to be our warden, Norbal
Vazquez, a longtime BOP functionary from Puerto Rico who is proverbial
for his deranged monologues as well as for being regarded with great
contempt by staff and inmates alike. Here are some actual quotes from
his exquisitely demented half-hour orientation talk, during which he
waddled back and forth, wagging his finger in admonishment when
appropriate and sometimes when not:
    On his own qualifications for the job: âI am here because I earned it!â
    On the assistant wardens upon whom lesser wardens depend: âI do
not need them!â
    On his inspiring biography: âI was a case manager before, and I
was an OUTSTANDING one!â [wags finger]
    On the status of we benighted inmates, sitting in darkness: âYou
are all my children!â
    On who controls the prison: âProbably in some of your minds, is
inmates! But you are wrong!â
    On, er, violators: âI have no mercy for violators!â
    On medical care: âYou have a bullet in your leg and you want the
bureau to heal you! Ha! Ha ha!â
    On the insufficiency of our meals: âDonât come complain to me
about your meals. Because there are children with nothing!â
    On gang warfare: âIf you show force, I am going to show force!â
    On homemade alcohol: âIf you are drinking all that nasty thing,
shame on you! When your liver fails, I donât care!â
    On inmates who are placed in the SHU and transferred to violent
maximum security prisons because theyâve been caught with harmless
contraband like synthetic marijuana: âThey cry like babies! I have no
The only disappointing thing about the presentation was that he didnât
end by exhibiting his medals and declaring himself President for Life;
indeed, I almost cried when someone told me he was retiring a few
weeks hence. And âall that nasty thingâ is my new favorite
hooch-related meme, edging out âPRISON MADE INTHOXICANTâ from a few
columns back.
All in all, it was an informative speech in spite of itself, even
aside from the fellowâs suspicious insistence on his own competence
and self-reliance and entirely meritocratic ascension to the top spot.
There was quite a bit of talk, for instance, about how the gangs
arenât in control of the prison, something that obviously wouldnât
need so much triumphant emphasis were such a state of affairs not at
least a possibility.
IN FACT, THE GANGS really donât have control over the prison. But then
neither does the administration, if by âcontrolâ we mean the ability
to make uncontested decisions over what happens within a given space,
in which case control is always a matter of degree. The federal and
state governments of the United States, for instance, exercise some
degree of overlapping control over their territory, but not to such an
extent that the various law-enforcement agencies â er, law enforcement
agencies â arrest any but a small minority of residents who violate
the law. This is just as well, since the law requires that the tens of
millions of Americans who use drugs or gamble or involve themselves in
prostitution be imprisoned â and thatâs not even counting federal law,
which, as convincingly estimated by civil liberties attorney Harvey
Silvergate in his book Three Felonies a Day, the average American
unwittingly violates every day. And thus it is that the U.S. can
continue to exist above the level of an unprecedented gulag state only
to the extent that its laws are not actually enforced â an
extraordinary and fundamental fact of American life that one might
hope in vain to see rise to the level of an election issue, but which
is at least worth keeping in mind when it comes to the debate over
whether or not we should keep granting the state ever more powerful
methods of surveillance until it becomes the All-Seeing God Against
Whose Laws We All Have Sinned. (Personally Iâd vote âno,â but then Iâm
a felon and canât vote anyway.)
As is the case with the country at large, the rules within each
federal prison are such that a large portion of everyday activity
actually violates those rules â and in both cases, 99 percent of the
violations go unpunished, while anyone who proves inconvenient to the
powers that be can be singled out for retaliation. Technically itâs
against the rules to give anything to another inmate, for instance, or
to sell or trade or lend for that matter, but of course this is done
all day without a second thought, often in plain view of the guards,
not a single one of whom would consider objecting. There are other
rules that are almost universally disregarded but can be invoked at
whim; there is also a catch-all violation, âAnything Unauthorized,â on
hand as a last resort. But rabble-rousers can usually be dispensed
with via more specific regulations such as those barring the signing
of petitions or holding of demonstrations. (I myself was thrown in the
hole for months due to my supposed leadership role in one such
demonstration against an abusive guard whoâd just threatened an
elderly man.)
Part of the justification behind those two regulations in particular
is that there exists a means by which inmates can have their
grievances addressed: the administrative remedy process. Naturally the
BOP routinely conspires to prevent inmates from completing that
process; the surreal lengths to which itâs gone to keep me from
pursuing my own retaliation complaint, a process Iâve documented in
this column over the course of the last nine months, are actually
quite commonly deployed against inmates deemed to have a good chance
of winning in court. Presumably this is why the Freedom of Information
Act request that The Intercept filed with the BOP some months ago to
obtain records of the administrative remedy process at FCI Fort Worth
was denied with no explanation, even though the documents in question
are specifically designated as being FOIA accessible. Any
comprehensive examination of those records would reveal a systematic
and highly effective effort by BOP officials to prevent inmates from
bringing instances of major policy violations and even outright
criminal activity by the bureau to the attention of the courts. The
American people do not control their own prisons.
The reality is that control is shared by way of a sort of makeshift
federalism that varies in particulars from prison to prison but in
which real power is always divided among the various gangs, the staff,
and local and regional administrators in an arrangement thatâs best
described as a cross between the old Swiss canton system and China
during the Warring States period, which Iâll be the first to
acknowledge is not especially helpful. Suffice to say that it will
take me the remainder of my sentence to provide a real sense of this
remarkable state-within-a-state and its inimitable politics â the
politics of the literally disenfranchised, who live their lives in the
very guts of government without being able to rely on its protections,
and so are forced to provide their own. Really, itâs a
Complicating matters further is the great extent to which prisons can
differ, with the most pronounced of these divisions being that between
the state and federal systems. Broadly, we federals tend to look down
upon our regional cousins as ânot quite our sort, old boy,â although
Iâm probably the only one who puts it in exactly those terms. The
state prisons tend to house the small-time dealers, whereas the feds
are more often home to the guys who supplied them. The state is
halfway filled with such actual criminals as thieves, rapists, and
murderers, whereas the feds are made up largely of illegal immigrants
and drug entrepreneurs â people who have neither hurt anyone nor
deprived them of their property, but instead made the mistake of
taking all of this âfree marketâ talk seriously. The character of the
federal prisons, then, will usually differ from those of the states.
But then theyâll also differ among themselves, sometimes quite a bit,
and not just along other readily obvious divisions such as those
between minimum, low, medium, and maximum security designations,
either. A few years ago the medium at Beaumont, Texas, to which I just
narrowly avoided being sent myself, was considerably more violent than
many of the maximums (also known as pens or, more technically, USPs).
Back at the FCI Fort Worth, there was a marked degree of difference in
how certain things were done even between the several 300-man units
into which inmates were divided. And since the local administrators
can disregard national policy more or less at will, as has been
documented in this column repeatedly for two years, de facto policy
will naturally vary from institution to institution as well. The
result of all of this is that each prison is its own unique snowflake,
fluttering about on gusts of cultural drift and BOP lawlessness.
THE VITAL STATISTICS of my stomping grounds here at Three Rivers,
then, are as follows. The prison is home to a bit more than 1,000
inmates, of whom about 60 percent are Mexican nationals, another 20
percent are U.S. Hispanics, 10 percent are black, 5 percent are Latin
American, and 5 percent are white (the ofay percentage of 15 percent I
cited last time appears to have been out of date). About half of the
Mexicans ârun withâ (institutional slang for âare affiliated withâ)
the Paisas, a relatively amorphous prison gang that draws its ranks
almost exclusively from Mexican nationals; a smaller percentage of
U.S. Hispanics run with Tango Blast, a more organized gang with a much
cooler name; while blacks and whites for purposes of prison riots and
dining arrangements both act mostly as race-based units.
As usual, there are all manner of qualifiers and exceptions plus a
smattering of smaller groupings: The Muslims will usually constitute
their own little umma, there are a couple of whites who run with
Tango, and so on. The most amusing of these aberrations involved the
fellow with whom I shared a cell before he transferred to a low a few
weeks back. Aaron LeBaron was born into an ultra-fundamentalist Mormon
cult led by his father, who had moved the wives and kids to Mexico
after some members of his congregation started to question whether or
not all of the voices he was hearing were actually from God. Aaron
eventually inherited the family theocracy as well as the family hit
list and the family international stolen car ring. In the end he was
captured and sentenced to 45 years. Today Aaron is an agnostic and
longtime Skeptic Magazine subscriber who was very excited to learn
that Iâd written for that magazine as well as for Skeptical Inquirer.
(Come to think of it, he was the only person Iâve ever met who found
either one the least bit impressive, and Iâve been working them into
introductory conversations for years.) At any rate, having been raised
in Mexico and speaking perfect Spanish, this gangly, bespectacled,
white, Mormon-looking fellow had been accepted as one of the Paisas,
with whom he sat every day to eat and watch television. Scientists
cannot measure the extent to which Iâm going to dominate every dinner
party conversation for the rest of my life.
For a medium, Three Rivers isnât particularly violent. The last major
gang war, between the Tangos and the Paisas, was nearly a year ago;
afterward the compound went on lockdown for about two weeks, itself a
fairly typical gang intelligence investigation/cool-down period. In
the three months since Iâve arrived, Iâve only had to âtake a kneeâ
once (inmates here are supposed to put at least one knee to the ground
when officers run by screaming âGet the fuck down!â or some variation
thereof as they proceed to the location of a conflict). And weâve only
been locked down in the aftermath of a fight on one occasion, for just
a few hours.
This is just as well, as Iâm thereby able to concentrate on the
trickle of information coming in from the wicked world beyond the
fence. Lately Iâve been getting garbled reports of hoverboards, as
well as some sort of new fascist movement that could conceivably take
control of the White House this year, though I find it difficult to
believe that the boards actually float like the ones from the movie.
Meanwhile, Iâm halfway through the newish first volume of Niall
Fergusonâs biography of Henry Kissinger, which we shall examine in
some detail next time. For now I will simply leave off with the
following actual sentences from Fergusonâs introduction: âIn this
context, it is a strange irony of the Kissinger literature that so
many of the critiques of Kissingerâs mode of operation have a subtle
undertone of anti-Semitism. â¦ This prompts the question: might the
ferocity of the criticism that Kissinger has attracted perhaps have
something to do with the fact that he, like the Rothschilds, is
Jewish? This is not to imply that his critics are anti-Semites.â Well,
the hyphens are all in their proper places, anyway.

A technical reading of the âHIMR Data Mining Research Problem Bookâ
3 February 2016
Boing Boing just released a classified GCHQ document that was meant to
act as the Sept 2011 guide to open research problems in Data Mining.
The intended audience, Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research
(HIMR), is part of the University of Bristol and composed of
mathematicians working for half their time on classified problems with
First off, a quick perusal of the actual publication record of the
HIMR makes a sad reading for GCHQ: it seems that very little research
on data mining was actually performed post-2011-2014 despite this
pitch. I guess this is what you get trying to make pure mathematicians
solve core computer science problems.
However, the document presents one of the clearest explanations of
GCHQâs operations and their scale at the time; as well as a very
interesting list of open problems, along with salient examples.
Overall, reading this document very much resembles reading the needs
of any other organization with big-data, struggling to process it to
get any value. The constrains under which they operate (see below),
and in particular the limitations to O(n log n) storage per vertex and
O(1) per edge event, is a serious threat â but of course this is only
for un-selected traffic. So the 5000 or so Tor nodes probably would
have a little more space and processing allocated to them, and so
would known botnets â I presume.
Secondly, there is clear evidence that timing information is both
recognized as being key to correlating events and streams; and it is
being recorded and stored at an increasing granularity. There is no
smoking gun as of 2011 to say they casually de-anonymize Tor circuits,
but the writing is on the wall for the onion routing system. GCHQ at
2011 had all ingredients needed to trace Tor circuits. It would take
extra-ordinary incompetence to not have refined their traffic analysis
techniques in the past 5 years. The Tor project should do well to not
underestimate GCHQâs capabilities to this point.
Thirdly, one should wonder why we have been waiting for 3 years until
such clear documents are finally being published from the Snowden
revelations. If those had been the first published, instead of the
obscure, misleading and very non-informative slides, it would have
saved a lot of time â and may even have engaged the public a bit more
than bad powerpoint.
Some interesting points in the document in order:
    It turns out that GCHQ has a written innovation strategy,
reference [I75]. If someone has a copy it would be great to see it,
and also understand where the ACE program fits in it.
    GCHQ, at the time used heavily two families of technologies:
Hadoop, for bulk processing of raw collected data (6 months for
meta-data apparently), and IBM Streams (DISTILLERY) for stream,
real-time, processing. A lot of the discussion, and open problems,
relate to the fact that bulk collection can only provide a limited
window of visibility, and intelligence related selection, and
processing has to happen within this window. Hence the interest in
processing streaming data.
    Section 2 is probably the clearest explanation of how modern
SIGINT works. I would like to congratulate the (anonymous) author, and
will be setting it as the key reading for my PETS class. It summarizes
well what countless crappy articles on the Snowden leaks have
struggled to piece together. I wish journalists just released this
first, and skipped the ugly slides.
    The intro provides a hit at the scale of cable interception
operations as of 2011. It seems that 200 âbearersâ of 10 Gigabit / sec
were being collected at any time; it makes clear that many more
sources were available to switch to depending on need. That is about 2
Terabit / sec, across 3 sites (Cheltenham, Bude, and LECKWITH).
    Section 2.1.2 explains that a lot (the majority) of data is
discarded very early on, by special hardware performing simple
matching on internet packets. I presume this is to filter out bulk
downloads (from CDNs), known sources of spam, youtube videos, etc.
    The same section (2.1.2) also explains that all meta-data is
pulled from the bearer, and provides an interpretation of what
meta-data is.
    Finally (2.1.2) there is a hint at indexing databases (Query
focused databases / QFD) that are specialized to store meta-data, such
as IP traffic flow data, for quick retrival based on selectors (like
IP addresses).
    Section 2.1.3 explains the problem of âtarget developmentâ, namely
when no good known selectors exist for a target, and it is the job of
the analyst to match it though either contact chaining or
modus-operandi (MO) matching. It is a very instructive section, which
is the technical justification underpinning a lot of the mass
surveillance going on.
    The cute example chosen to illustrate it (Page 12, end of 2.1.3):
Apparently GCHQ developed many of those techniques to spy on foreign
delegations during the 2009 G20 meeting. Welcome to London!
    Section 2.2.2 provides a glimpse at the cybersecurity doctrine and
world-view at GCHQ, already in 2011. In particular, there is a vision
that CESG will act as a network security service for the nation,
blocking attacks at the âfirewallsâ, and doing attribution (as if the
attacks will be coming âfrom outsideâ). GCHQ would then counter-attack
the hostile sources, or simply use the material they intercepted from
others (4th party collection, the euphemism goes).
    Section 2.2.3 provides a glimpse of the difficulties of running
implants on compromised machines: something that is openly admitted.
Apparently ex-filtrating traffic and establishing command-and-control
with implants is susceptible to passive SIGINT, both a problem and an
    Section 3 and beyond describes research challenges that are very
similar with any other large organization or research group: the
difficulty of creating labelled data sets for training machine
learning models; the challenges on working on partial or streaming
data; the need for succinct representations of data structures; and
the problem of inferring âinformation flowâ â namely chains of
communications that are related to each other.
    It seems the technique of choice when it comes to machine learning
is Random Decision Forrests. Good choice, I also prefer it to others.
They have an in-house innovation: they weight the outputs of each
decision tree. (Something that is sometimes called gradual learning in
the open literature, I believe).
    Steganography detection seems to be a highlight: however there is
no explanation if steganography is a real problem they encountered in
the field, or if it was an easy dataset to generate synthetically.
    Section 4, deals with research problems of âInformation Flow in
Graphsâ. This is the problem of associated multiple related
connections together, including across types of channels, detecting
botnet Command and Control nodes, and also tracing Tor connections.
Tracing Tor nodes is in fact a stated problem, with a stated solution.
    Highlights include the simple âremitâ algorithm that developed by
Detica (page 26, Sect. 4.2.1); PRIME TIME that looks at chains of
length 2; and finally HIDDEN OTTER, that specifically targets Tor, and
botnets. (Apparently an internal group codenamed ICTR-NE develop it).
    Section 4.2.2 looks at communications association through temporal
correlation: one more piece of evidence that timing analysis, at a
coarse scale, is on the cards for mining associations. What is cute is
the example used is how to detect all GCHQ employees: they are the
ones with phones not active between 9am and 5pm when they are at work.
    Beside these, they are interested in change / anomaly detection
(4.4.1), spread of information (such as extremest material), etc. Not
that dissimilar from say an analysis Facebook would perform.
    Section 5 poses problem relating to algorithms on streaming graph
data. It provides a definitions of the tolerable costs of analysis
algorithms (the semi-streaming paradigm): for a graph of n vertices
(nodes), they can store a bit of info per vertex, but not all edges,
or even process all edges. So they have O(n log n) storage and can
only do O(1) processing per event / edge. That could be distilled to a
set of security assumptions.
    Section 5.2.2 / 5.2.3 is an interesting discussion about
relaxations of cliques and also point of that very popular nodes (the
pizza delivery line) probably are noise and should be discarded.
    As of 2011 (sect 5.2.4) it was an open problem how far contact
chaining is required. This is set as an open problem, but states that
analysis usually use 2-hops from targets. Note that other possible
numbers are 3, 4, and 5 since after 6 you probably have included
nearly everyone in the world. So it is not that exciting a problem and
cannot blame the pure mathematicians for not tackling it.
    Section 5.5.1 asks the question on whether there is an
approximation of the correlation matrix, to avoid storing and
processing an n x n matrix. It generally seems that matching
identifiers with identifiers is big business.
    Section 6 poses problems relating to the processing, data mining,
and analysis of âexpiringâ graphs, namely graphs with edges that
disappear after a deadline. This is again related to the constraint
that storage for bulk un-selected data is limited.
    In section 6.3.2 the semi-streaming model where only O(n log n)
storage per vertex is allowed, and O(1) processing per incoming event
    Appendix A deals with models of academic engagement. I have to say
it is very enlightened: it recognizes the value of openly publishing
the research, after some sanitization. Nice.
    Appendix B and C discuss the technical details and size of the IBM
Streams and Hadoop clusters. Section D presents the production
clusters (652 nodes, total 5216 cores, and 32 GB memory for each
    Section E discusses the legalities of using intercepted data for
research, and bless them they do try to provide some logging and Human
Rights Justification (bulk authorization for research purposes).

this is wonderful reporting; thank you Douglas!
some links referenced are dead? unable to retrieve:
 the OIG report on mind-altering drugs used during interrogations is
indeed informative!
 All seemed well until the morning of August 6, 2010, when the veteran,
needing to process his student visa, crossed back into the United
States. He handed over his passport at the border patrol office at the
Calais, Maine port of entry and, according to an FBI report, was
detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for âquestioning in
an espionage matter.â That very dayâtiming too exact to be
coincidentalâDetective Kniss filed a criminal complaint against DeHart
in Tennessee for the child porn investigation, nearly two whole years
after the alleged conduct. FBI agents took DeHart from the border
station to a windowless examination room. According to the veteran, he
was pushed into what looked like a dentistâs chair and administered a
forced IV that made him feel druggedâan interrogation technique
practiced at Guantanamo. About 20 minutes later, he was taken to a
conference area and interrogated by the FBI, his requests for a lawyer
denied. Using the new child porn filing as leverageâDeHart says an
agent told him the bureau knew he was not guilty in that matterâthe
FBI extracted a forced confession that interpreted the embassy visits
as attempts to sell military secrets in an arrangement involving other
soldiers from the Indiana base. In DeHartâs telling, he was also
questioned about Anonymous and WikiLeaks. The agents ultimately
arrested him on the child porn charges and deposited him in a Bangor
jail, where he collapsed. An ambulance took him to Eastern Maine
Medical Center; there a medical report was made that called him
âparanoid and delusional with an idea of the FBI monitoring him and
accusing him of espionage.â The ER personnel released DeHart into the
FBIâs hands. Agents then interrogated him for two weeks without
counsel present, interviews the FBI acknowledges but the reports for
which remain classified. At one point, DeHart claims, he was hooded
and tasered. The bureau also acquired his âconsentâ to take over his
online aliases; the defendant would later warn through the National
Post that âThey are becoming you on the Internetâspecifically for the
purpose of going after Anonymous.â During one of his court appearances
in this time frame, Judge Margaret Kravchuk raised questions about the
case, calling it âodd,â but nevertheless ordered DeHart sent to
Nashville for pre-trial detention.

the problem with high traffic sites is a local confirmation attack.
E.g. your colo line is really active! and on a short list of suspects
above large traffic threshold.
an outage of your local link for 3-5 min leads to confirmation across
10,000 probe sessions, circuit extension attempts, and connect
attempts, all confirming yes indeed suspect hidden service suddenly
out of reach. [ is this sufficient *proof* for $context? who knows,
but you get the picture...]
at least now the feds can't pretend to be the technicians servicing
your outage under cover, anymore... ;)
attacks attempting to confirm a solitary client connecting to a peer
(e.g. very low degree node) are at different risk than those highly
centralized, very active services experience.
good luck to you! and please share insights and experience :)

yes; it's a traffic confirmation attack, and by interrupting the flow
you confirm that the endpoints in question are involved in that flow.

Mathematicians Discover Prime Conspiracy
A previously unnoticed property of prime numbers seems to violate a
longstanding assumption about how they behave.
By: Erica Klarreich	
March 13, 2016
Two mathematicians have uncovered a simple, previously unnoticed
property of prime numbers â those numbers that are divisible only by 1
and themselves. Prime numbers, it seems, have decided preferences
about the final digits of the primes that immediately follow them.
Among the first billion prime numbers, for instance, a prime ending in
9 is almost 65 percent more likely to be followed by a prime ending in
1 than another prime ending in 9. In a paper posted online today,
Kannan Soundararajan and Robert Lemke Oliver of Stanford University
present both numerical and theoretical evidence that prime numbers
repel other would-be primes that end in the same digit, and have
varied predilections for being followed by primes ending in the other
possible final digits.
âWeâve been studying primes for a long time, and no one spotted this
before,â said Andrew Granville, a number theorist at the University of
Montreal and University College London. âItâs crazy.â
The discovery is the exact opposite of what most mathematicians would
have predicted, said Ken Ono, a number theorist at Emory University in
Atlanta.  When he first heard the news, he said, âI was floored. I
thought, âFor sure, your programâs not working.ââ
This conspiracy among prime numbers seems, at first glance, to violate
a longstanding assumption in number theory: that prime numbers behave
much like random numbers. Most mathematicians would have assumed,
Granville and Ono agreed, that a prime should have an equal chance of
being followed by a prime ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9 (the four possible
endings for all prime numbers except 2 and 5).
âI canât believe anyone in the world would have guessed this,â
Granville said. Even after having seen Lemke Oliver and
Soundararajanâs analysis of their phenomenon, he said, âit still seems
like a strange thing.â
Yet the pairâs work doesnât upend the notion that primes behave
randomly so much as point to how subtle their particular mix of
randomness and order is. âCan we redefine what ârandomâ means in this
context so that once again, [this phenomenon] looks like it might be
random?â Soundararajan said. âThatâs what we think weâve done.â
Prime Preferences
Soundararajan was drawn to study consecutive primes after hearing a
lecture at Stanford by the mathematician Tadashi Tokieda, of the
University of Cambridge, in which he mentioned a counterintuitive
property of coin-tossing: If Alice tosses a coin until she sees a head
followed by a tail, and Bob tosses a coin until he sees two heads in a
row, then on average, Alice will require four tosses while Bob will
require six tosses (try this at home!), even though head-tail and
head-head have an equal chance of appearing after two coin tosses.
Soundararajan wondered if similarly strange phenomena appear in other
contexts. Since he has studied the primes for decades, he turned to
them â and found something even stranger than he had bargained for.
Looking at prime numbers written in base 3 â in which roughly half the
primes end in 1 and half end in 2 â he found that among primes smaller
than 1,000, a prime ending in 1 is more than twice as likely to be
followed by a prime ending in 2 than by another prime ending in 1.
Likewise, a prime ending in 2 prefers to be followed a prime ending in
Soundararajan showed his findings to postdoctoral researcher Lemke
Oliver, who was shocked. He immediately wrote a program that searched
much farther out along the number line â through the first 400 billion
primes. Lemke Oliver again found that primes seem to avoid being
followed by another prime with the same final digit. The primes
âreally hate to repeat themselves,â Lemke Oliver said.
Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan discovered that this sort of bias in
the final digits of consecutive primes holds not just in base 3, but
also in base 10 and several other bases; they conjecture that itâs
true in every base. The biases that they found appear to even out,
little by little, as you go farther along the number line â but they
do so at a snailâs pace. âItâs the rate at which they even out which
is surprising to me,â said James Maynard, a number theorist at the
University of Oxford. When Soundararajan first told Maynard what the
pair had discovered, âI only half believed him,â Maynard said. âAs
soon as I went back to my office, I ran a numerical experiment to
check this myself.â
Lemke Oliver and Soundararajanâs first guess for why this bias occurs
was a simple one: Maybe a prime ending in 3, say, is more likely to be
followed by a prime ending in 7, 9 or 1 merely because it encounters
numbers with those endings before it reaches another number ending in
3. For example, 43 is followed by 47, 49 and 51 before it hits 53, and
one of those numbers, 47, is prime.
But the pair of mathematicians soon realized that this potential
explanation couldnât account for the magnitude of the biases they
found. Nor could it explain why, as the pair found, primes ending in 3
seem to like being followed by primes ending in 9 more than 1 or 7. To
explain these and other preferences, Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan
had to delve into the deepest model mathematicians have for random
behavior in the primes.
Random Primes
Prime numbers, of course, are not really random at all â they are
completely determined. Yet in many respects, they seem to behave like
a list of random numbers, governed by just one overarching rule: The
approximate density of primes near any number is inversely
proportional to how many digits the number has.
In 1936, Swedish mathematician Harald CramÃ©r explored this idea using
an elementary model for generating random prime-like numbers: At every
whole number, flip a weighted coin â weighted by the prime density
near that number â to decide whether to include that number in your
list of random âprimes.â CramÃ©r showed that this coin-tossing model
does an excellent job of predicting certain features of the real
primes, such as how many to expect between two consecutive perfect
Despite its predictive power, CramÃ©râs model is a vast
oversimplification. For instance, even numbers have as good a chance
of being chosen as odd numbers, whereas real primes are never even,
apart from the number 2. Over the years, mathematicians have developed
refinements of CramÃ©râs model that, for instance, bar even numbers and
numbers divisible by 3, 5, and other small primes.
These simple coin-tossing models tend to be very useful rules of thumb
about how prime numbers behave. They accurately predict, among other
things, that prime numbers shouldnât care what their final digit is â
and indeed, primes ending in 1, 3, 7 and 9 occur with roughly equal
Yet similar logic seems to suggest that primes shouldnât care what
digit the prime after them ends in. It was probably mathematiciansâ
overreliance on the simple coin-tossing heuristics that made them miss
the biases in consecutive primes for so long, Granville said. âItâs
easy to take too much for granted â to assume that your first guess is
The primesâ preferences about the final digits of the primes that
follow them can be explained, Soundararajan and Lemke Oliver found,
using a much more refined model of randomness in primes, something
called the prime k-tuples conjecture. Originally stated by
mathematicians G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood in 1923, the
conjecture provides precise estimates of how often every possible
constellation of primes with a given spacing pattern will appear. A
wealth of numerical evidence supports the conjecture, but so far a
proof has eluded mathematicians.
The prime k-tuples conjecture subsumes many of the most central open
problems in prime numbers, such as the twin primes conjecture, which
posits that there are infinitely many pairs of primes â such as 17 and
19 â that are only two apart. Most mathematicians believe the twin
primes conjecture not so much because they keep finding more twin
primes, Maynard said, but because the number of twin primes theyâve
found fits so neatly with what the prime k-tuples conjecture predicts.
In a similar way, Soundararajan and Lemke Oliver have found that the
biases they uncovered in consecutive primes come very close to what
the prime k-tuples conjecture predicts. In other words, the most
sophisticated conjecture mathematicians have about randomness in
primes forces the primes to display strong biases. âI have to rethink
how I teach my class in analytic number theory now,â Ono said.
At this early stage, mathematicians say, itâs hard to know whether
these biases are isolated peculiarities, or whether they have deep
connections to other mathematical structures in the primes or
elsewhere. Ono predicts, however, that mathematicians will immediately
start looking for similar biases in related contexts, such as prime
polynomials â fundamental objects in number theory that canât be
factored into simpler polynomials.
And the finding will make mathematicians look at the primes themselves
with fresh eyes, Granville said. âYou could wonder, what else have we
missed about the primes?â

@_subject: Arithmetic Coding and Blinding for Lattice Cryptography 
Abstract: In this work we apply information theoretically optimal
arithmetic coding and a number of novel side-channel blinding
countermeasure techniques to create BLZZRD, a practical, compact, and
more quantum-resistant variant of the BLISS Ring-LWE Signature Scheme.
We show how the hash-based random oracle can be modified to be more
secure against quantum preimage attacks while decreasing signature
size at any given security level. Most lattice-based cryptographic
algorithms require non-uniformly distributed ciphertext, signature,
and public/private key data to be stored and transmitted; hence there
is a requirement for compression. Arithmetic Coding offers an
information theoretically optimal compression for stationary and
memoryless sources, such as the discrete Gaussian distributions often
used in Lattice-based cryptography. We show that this technique gives
better signature sizes than the previously proposed advanced
Huffman-based compressors. We further demonstrate that arithmetic
decoding from an uniform source to target distribution is also an
optimal Gaussian sampling method in the sense that a minimal amount of
true random bits is required. Performance of the new Binary Arithmetic
Coding (BAC) sampler is comparable to other mainstream samplers. The
same code, tables, or circuitry can be utilised for both tasks,
eliminating the need for separate sampling and compression components.
We also describe a simple blinding technique that can be applied to
anti-cyclic polynomial multiplication to mask timing- and power
consumption side-channels in ring arithmetic. We further show that
Gaussian sampling can also be blinded by a split-and-permute technique
while reducing the size of required CDF tables.
