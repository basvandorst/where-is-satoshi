I forgot to mention that I don't have capable GPU for mining, but I don't
care. When I need bitcoins, I simply go to market and buy some. It is the
same situation as gold miners. Somebody is interested in making big holes to
ground and spend a lot of time and money on that. And somebody do anything
else, like me.

Kyle, there was introduced GPU miner before few months, so your experience
sounds reasonable. GPUs are approximately 100x faster on hashes than CPUs,
so i7 probably won't help much. But almost everybody has now GPU capable for
mining and code is opensource. Yours complaints are on the same level as if
you say 'I have only 486DX, those guys with Quad cores driving me crazy'.
Bitcoins are 'fair' on level that everybody can go to shop and buy strong
There is also mechanism (called 'difficulty') which control amount of blocks
mined every day. So nobody can buy extra-hyper-mega-gpu-cluster and get rich
by finding millions of bitcoins per week. He will always find maximum ~200
blocks per day, because it is limit of network. And I'm pretty sure that it
won't be profitable business, because current difficulty makes mining more
expensive than actual price of bitcoins.
Regards to wasting electricity. There are many kinds of wastes. Somebody
waste electricity to finding bitcoins, somebody find UFO using
seti our EU government spend bilions of EUR on 'green energy'
ineffective solar and wind technology. I think using nuclear energy and mine
bitcoins (as government independent currency) is much better combination. So
it is just another point of view to 'waste'.
