Failure to be *able* to assure that this *didn't* happen in that

Why worry about satellites when car/plane/neighbor unpiloted remote
controlled airplanes work so well?
You're free-radiating electronic emissions.  That's all a determined
adversary needs.  Or an opportunistic war-driving script-kiddie, for
that matter.
Does anyone know whether the low-power nature of wireless LANs protects
them from eavesdropping by satellite?  Is there some simple reference
that would easily let me figure out whether transmitters at a given
power are in danger of eavesdropping by satellite?  --John

No, and neither are corporate customers, to a large extent.
Accountability is, in fact, a treasured property of business computing.
Lack of accountability creates things like Enron, Anderson Consulting,
Oil-for-Food scams, and the missing 9 billion dollars or so of
reconstruction aid.  It's the fuel that propells SPAM, graft, and
identity theft.
What I've not seen is much work providing accountability for anonymous
It's a shame people persist in thinking a single solution will satify
everyone, as though computing was somehow different from everything else
in life.
