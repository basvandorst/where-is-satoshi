Nice, I like it very much.
It also demonstrates the need for DNSCrypt, then "site.com" would also disappear from a few places.
Can you release the source code for the demonstration? That would allow other to build up on your work. Other things like DNSCrypt, distributed DNS, alternative web of trust (HTTPS), evil https certificate authorities and so on could be added to the graphics.

Tell me if I am wrong, but I think it's not worth to bother with mixmaster, mixmion, remailing, etc. anymore. It's practically dead.
Some remailing systems have been written by high profile people, some of them are now working on Tor.
Due to high latency, remailers are theoretically more secure than low latency Tor. There are too few users, too few servers and too few development. Project mailing lists are empty since years. Tor has much more of everything.
Never looked if it's still up to date, but there is a big wiki page about it.

We documented, which data, malware inside a VM could collect to identify users. [1] That doesn't mean, we wouldn't be happy about sophisticated, dedicated research. However, here is a summary:
- (Apart from obvious and known, IP, DNS, (browser) fingerprinting.)
- internal LAN IP (of virtualized operating system)
- time zone (of virtualized operating system)
- username (of virtualized operating system)
- hostname (of virtualized operating system)
- mac address of virtual machine
- mac address of host (if using bridged networking) or mac address of gateway (if using virtual internal networking)
- virtual disk uuids
- Some information about the real CPU, depends on VM software. There might be options to further hide information about the CPU.
- Installed software packages.
- If you copy data into the VM: metadata.

The situation on smartphones is much worse than on Windows.
Google may silently install malware on Android phones. The only way to prevent that, is not using the market, which is very inconvenient and barely anyone goes that way. The phone book and calendar is with default settings automatically mirrored on Google servers, most people have it activated.
I wrote more about that a while ago... [1]
