Maybe in the good ol' USA, but apparently not so elsewhere.  The following quote is from a CBC radio show, "Dispatches", about 3/4 down the page at ===== Start quote =====
"In the Congo,...a mining company can pay its taxes and fees to the local warlord, knowing full well that the money will be used to arm guerillas and kill more people. All perfectly legal. All perfectly That's a passage from the new book, "Making A Killing: How And Why Corporations Use Armed Force To Do Business."
Canadian author Madelaine Drohan has examined the corporate use of violence and private militias down through the years, and concludes, "you can't trust corporations to wield armed force."
While the cases she documents are all in Africa, in our interview she reminds us that Canada was opened up by British fur companies operating on the same principle.

That seemed short-lived.  Both links to the Playfair project at Sarovar are dead:  and   The search function doesn't come up with anything either...
Has there been any further news on this?

But then the ballot is spoiled, and not counted.
In Canada we have the option to "decline to vote".  Go to the polling station, register your name, take the ballot, then tell the clerk that you "decline to vote".  This indicates that you believe that no-one on the ballot is a suitable candidate for office.  The ballot is counted, but none of the candidates gets a vote.  This ensures that you don't accidentally elect an unsuitable candidate with a protest vote, ie. selecting the lesser of two evils.  By declining to vote you elect neither of the two evils.
I'm not sure what happens when there are more declined ballots than votes for a candidate. Certainly it should draw some media attention to the option of declining to vote -- I find that very few people know about it.  It sure caused a stir at our polling booth!

Or are you thinking of the "Three Blind Phreaks", profiled in Wired magazine earlier this year?

There's some wonderful Sicilian Reasoning in that: We can't reveal the rule because the Bad Guys would figure out what we're looking for.  But the Bad Guys already know what we're looking for, but we'll keep the rule secret anyway because we know they know what we're looking for. The thing is, the Bad Guys know that too...
