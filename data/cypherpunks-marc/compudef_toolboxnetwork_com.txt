Find out now if you are infected with a complimentary scan from Privacy Defender 3.0.
Privacy Defender 3.0 scans your computer for malicious adware and spyware. It detects it, deletes it and keeps your computer safe from future infections. Ad/spyware can steal your identity and personal information right from your PC. Signs of being infected:
1. Your home page keeps changing

3. Excessive popup advertisements
4. Toolbars appearing on your browser
5. Frequent system crashes.
Take the free scan now:
If you, or someone using your PC, have downloaded Internet files such as music, games, screensavers, pictures or movies, then adware and spyware programs have been added to your computer's hard drive without your direct knowledge. This "drive-by download" technique is rapidly growing - get your protection today.
Not protecting yourself against spyware/adware makes you easy prey for identity theft, computer corruption and pop-up ads. Spyware/adware can easily bypass your antivirus and firewall protection and install on your system without your knowledge. This is known as "stealth software". Spyware/adware programs are nearly impossible for most PC users to detect and remove. Let Privacy Defender protect your PC around the clock.
