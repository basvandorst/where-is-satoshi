Here's         your daily joke submitted by our good friend Hal:
        A Texan farmer goes to Australia for a vacation. There he meets an Aussie         farmer and gets talking. The Aussie shows off his big wheat field and         the Texan says, "Oh! We have wheat fields that are at least twice         as large."
        Then they walk around the ranch a little, and the Aussie shows off his         herd of cattle. The Texan immediately says, "We have longhorns that         are at least twice as large as your cows."
        The conversation has, meanwhile, almost died when the Texan sees a herd         of kangaroos hopping through the field in the distance. Amazed, he asks,         "What the hell are those?!"
        The Aussie replies with an incredulous look, "Don't you have any         grasshoppers in Texas?"
