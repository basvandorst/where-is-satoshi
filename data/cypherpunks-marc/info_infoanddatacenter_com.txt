As Always, we try         our best to hear you.... The information you require...         The products and services that interest you and your lifestyle. DNA testing         has been a matter that has been brought to our attention in recent months.         Some of you wanted access to a scientific laboratory that offers DNA testing         at reasonable prices. As usual, we did our homework, and established a         relationship with a highly accredited and regarded partner laboratory.
Our           Partner Diagnostics Center is the largest           and most experienced private DNA paternity testing laboratory in the           world! Our laboratory is used by most hospitals and attorneys, as well           as many US Immigration Departments and Embassies worldwide. In fact,           our partner laboratory has performed testing or clients in all 50 states           and over 68 countries around the globe!
Many           people utilize DNA testing for many reasons. Usually, to answer an important           question. We provide accurate, important answers based           on quantifiable DNA scientific data at very reasonable prices - along           with great service that makes the entire experience as stress           free as possible!
Who needs DNA Testing?
A man who wishes definitive,           scientific proof of a child's legal parentage.
Someone wanting peace of mind.
A woman seeking child support from a man           who is the child's birth father.
A person attempting to win visitation or           custody.

Did you Know?
We can coordinate DNA           collections of all parties involved anywhere in the U.S. and abroad           (additional costs may apply for shipping outside the U.S.).
Client relationships and test results are           strictly confidential and only available to parties involved. Most courts accept 99.0% as a probability           of paternity. We at IDC hold our lab to a higher standard of 99.9% or           better to insure accuracy!
More judges in more courtrooms recognize           paternity results from our partner laboratory than from any other private           paternity testing laboratory.
A doctor's order or a court order is not           required to have a DNA paternity test, unless you live in the state           of New York.
The prices we have been able to negotiate           for DNA testing are lower than most reputable labs offering the same           tests! We have seen similar tests priced for as much as $900.
Our       DNA tests are $390!!!
