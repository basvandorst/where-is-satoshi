I saw a little coverage of this on TV (it might have been MSNBC,

The story at that point was that the AP *had* the video, or
at least some of it, but were self-censoring.  The implication was
that it was because of the death threats.
They had the chief of the AP bureau involved (the Palestinian

From 2600 DMCA APPEAL LOST - FELTEN LAWSUIT THROWN OUT
Posted 28 Nov 2001 22:39:50 UTC
A decision has come down in our DMCA appeal in the 2nd Circuit Court
of Appeals. We lost.
The text of the decision is now available and Judge Kaplan's decision
of August 2000 was upheld.
We will update this story as we continue to learn more. And we want to
thank everyone who has continued to support us in this long and
difficult battle.
The decision is linked at I've read through it (71 pages).  The Court of Appeals seems
to have done a thorough job of considering the arguments of
both sides.  They want to take a narrow interpretation of the
1st ammendment, in order to allow new developments of law
concerning electronic media to emerge.  They were thoroughly convinced that computer code is speech,
whether in object form, source code or something else.  They
devoted many pages to defending this position.  But they
also distinguished the functional from the speech elements of
a run-able program (following Judge Kaplan), and believe that
the functional component, which essentially can break the law
without a user doing much other than running it, lessens
1st ammendment protection.  Like Kaplan, they think providing a clickable hyperlink to download
a file on another site is the same as providing that file on
your site.
They don't seem to think that fair use implies any particular ability
to copy in a way the customer chooses - seeming to say that the
copyright owners can dictate what constitutes fair use.
I'm looking forward to seeing a more complete analysis by
someone with better credentials than I have...the above
are just a few things I noticed.

Evidently, this was covered on BBC Newsnight.
From the article@
Extracting a 3DES key from an IBM 4758
The IBM 4758 is an extremely secure crytographic co-processor. It is
used by banking systems and in other security conscious applications
to hold keying material. It is designed to make it impossible to
extract this keying material unless you have the correct permissions
and can involve others in a conspiracy.
We are able, by a mixture of sleight-of-hand and raw processing power,
to persuade an IBM 4758 running IBM's ATM (cash machine) support
software called the "Common Cryptographic Architecture" (CCA) to
export any and all its DES and 3DES keys to us. All we need is:
    * about 20 minutes uninterrupted access to the device
    * one person's ability to use the Combine_Key_Parts permission
    * a standard off-the-shelf $995 FPGA evaluation board from Altera
    * about two days of "cracking" time
The attack can only be performed by an insider with physical access to
the cryptographic co-processor, but they can act alone. The FPGA
evaluation board is used as a "brute force key cracking"
machine. Programming this is a reasonably straightforward task that
does not require specialist hardware design knowledge. Since the board
is pre-built and comes with all the necessary connectors and tools, it
is entirely suitable for amateur use.
Besides being the first documented attack on the IBM 4758 to be run
"in anger", we believe that this is only the second DES cracking
machine in the open community that has actually been built and then
used to find an unknown key!
Until IBM fix the CCA software to prevent our attack, banks are
vulnerable to a dishonest branch manager whose teenager has $995 and a
few hours to spend in duplicating our work.  Contents

@_subject: Trends in criminal acts against civil aviation 1992-2000 
I came across some interesting reading.
I'm working on a paper about information security and security through
obscurity.  Part of my thesis is that tightened airport security in
the US largely misses the mark.  My main goal is to identify where
traditional "security through obscurity" is being brought into play in
recent security changes.
I found a good Web site that I wasn't aware of, and wanted to share
some findings:
This is really great reading.  Every year (in about July for the
previous year - nothing on 2001 yet), the FAA produces a detailed
analysis of trends in hijacking, explosives, etc. involving civil
aviation.  It's intended to be exhaustive, with data from around
the world.  As we've all probably noticed, no US-based civil aviation incident
goes unreported in the popular press.  Hijackings and airline
bombings, when they occur, are big news.
I was surprised to see that the number of US-registered air carriers
involved in hijackings (and most other acts the FAA considers in these
reports) from 1992 - 2000 is zero.
This stuff happens to non-US airlines, and usually outside
of the US.
Hijacking count by year (all incidents; total for US is 0 in all years):
2000	20
1999	11
1998	9
1997	10
1996	14
1995	9
1994	23
1993	31
1992	12
Bombings and attempted bombings is steady at close to zero across 1992
- 2000, with either 1 or 0 in all years worldwide (except 3 in 1994).
Incidents tend to occur in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East,
with fewer in Europe than might be expected and across the board very
few in North America.
The FAA's categories are:
They specifically do not include incidents involving military
aircraft, and exclude most incidents that occur in wartorn areas.
(A note to the alert: I don't think TWA 800's explosion in 1996
appears in these reports, as the cause was not determined as of July
1997 when the 1996 report came out.  Reports are only available online
1996-2000, and cover a 5-year period -- that's why I don't go back
From the evidence in these reports, you might form several different
- The world suddenly turned much more dangerous in 2001 (at least the
US part of the world).
- Airport security in the US is truly exceptional, resulting in a
disproportionally small number of reportable incidents.
- For a variety of reasons, the US and US-based airlines have just not
been as attractive to criminals as non-US.  (This is at least
partially true: a lot of incidents involve people seeking political
asylum -- people don't get on a jet at JFK to seek asylum in the US
[or on a jet headed towards JFK], as they're already there!  The
reports comment on this several times.)
- The US media and government trend of refusing to acknowledge or even
publicize the demands of hijackers has decreased the appeal (other
countries have followed suit with this approach).  Remember Tommy Lee
Jones in "The Fugitive?"  "I don't negotiate."
Whatever angle you take, there seems to be pretty damned good airline
security in the US and for US-based airlines.
Here's a quote from the 2000 report, in which the number of incidents
overall nearly doubled (to 42) from the prior 3 years:
"During the past few years, the relatively low number of incidents
that were recorded may have been interpreted as an indication that the
threat to civil aviation was decreasing.  The fact that the number of
aviation-related incidents in 2000 increased by 75% proves such an
interpretation to be premature.  To be sure, the threat to civil
aviation has not significantly decreased.  In addition to the
ever-present threat of a terrorist hijacking or bombing, an individual
who hijacks a plane to seek asylum, a guerrilla group that attacks an
airport, or a terrorist group that bombs an airline ticket office,
constitutes a threat as well.  The increase in the number of incidents
in 2000 attests to the fact that civil aviation continues to be a
target of terrorists and non-terrorists alike." (p. 47)

Some electronic journals, some conferences and some print journals
now let authors retain copyright or, if they keep copyright,
allow authors to do what they please with their work.
It's far more typical, though, for the journal to get all rights,
except perhaps classroom use (aka "fair use") by the author.
(And then charge the author's institution a fortune to subscribe
to the same journal.)
I think that there are still some journals iwth these "page charges,"
in which the employer or (more likely) some grants are expected
to pay for publication.  This was prevalent in the sciences, not
arts and humanities.
I never had to pay any, but information science (me) is more like a
social science than a hard science in many ways.
I *have*, this year, been told that a journal would be happy to
publish my screen shots in color for a few $thousand per page,
but would do them in B&W free.
Not much has changed, other than continued price rises and consolidation
in the publishing industry.  Ejournals are making in-roads, especially
in some fields, and are breaking some patterns.  Print publishers are
working to "extend and embrace" some of the new models.
Meanwhile, academic libraries are undergoing a continued "serials
crisis" where the price increases in print journals far exceeds
any other cost.  There was (maybe still is?) a boycott of some
Elsevier products for some of their more eggregious pricing.

Check out the "library," "church," "arrest" & "diner" PSAs especially.
From the PSA's descriptive text, "This first round of PSAs for the
campaign has been created to celebrate our nation's freedom and remind
Americans about the importance of freedom and the need to protect it
for future generations."
In fact, though, that's not the message I saw at all.  The message I
saw was scenes from one step -- a baby step -- beyond where we are
now: reduced freedoms, neighbors monitoring and distrusting each
other, overzealous and barely constrained law enforcement.  Fear.
The Web page says the PSAs are designed based on market research to
"assist Americans during the war on terrorism."  I don't understand
why they used scare tactics in these but the outcome, for me, is a
different interpretation of the PSA's tag-lines, "Freedom. Appreciate
it. Cherish it. Protect it."
What I hear is "what you have IS freedom, despite how it appears.
See, we can show you how much worse it could be."
