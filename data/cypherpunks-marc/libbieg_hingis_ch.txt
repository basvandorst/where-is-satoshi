Your comfort and convenience is our prime concern. N`o more:  A man was speeding down the highway, feeling secure in a gaggle of cars all
traveling at the same speed. However, as they passed a speed trap, he got
nailed with an infrared speed detector and was pulled over. The officer
handed him the citation, received his signature and was about to walk away
when the man asked, "Officer, I know I was speeding, but I don't think it's
fair - there ere plenty of other cars around me who were going just as fast,
so why did *I* get the ticket?" "Ever go fishing?" the policeman suddenly
asked the man. "Ummm, yeah..." the startled man replied. The officer grinned
and added, "Ever catch *all* the fish?"
My mother and I were standing at he check-out in the supermarket as the
cashier scanned the things we bought. When the price of a bottle of orange
juice was scanned as $4,, my mother said "It's only $3.95."The cashier
stopped wheat she was doing and disappeared down one of the aisles to check
the price. she soon returned and said that the price was $3.95. When she
handed my mother the change, a five cent coin rolled onto the floor. Much to
my amusement, as the cashier bent over to search for it, my mother said "Oh,
don't bother, it's only five cents." youjiyam3yuufutsu02tennenki,yatarou tenshiji.
