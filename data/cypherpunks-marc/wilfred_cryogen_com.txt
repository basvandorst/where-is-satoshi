More worm derivatives... And to think we could have killed off all derivatives as well as all the
"harborer of incompetance" units long, long ago, but no... our wonderful
feds here in the states indicate that release of a repair bot (regardless
of where from) would be appropriate merit to be assholes and
arrest/imprison the simpleton sheep willing to fix other moronics and
prevent these horrendous antics... As my various servers are being hit at over a hundred persistant requests a
second, probibing for cmd.exe/etc and related failures in basic system
design... Too bad said boxes have never run faulty code.
Oh well... Who is actually at fault? Possibly the feds can again raise
their hands in this case, eh? ...

I have started to index "miraculous" patents and whatnot via the MEMES.NET

In light of the forthcoming Tyrany/Dictatorship with the all-honest
fed-gestapo, and resulting from Fox's display of (attached image) upon the
takedown of their entire server array immediately after posting
*legitimate* inquiry/articles, I search and notice a severe lack of
publicised listings of the conventional emergency indicator images, the old
cold-war type warning symbols, and there is absolutely no publication
(disappeared, with a *heck* of a lot of other "safety" and
counter-hostility information) of any of the response directives, nor can
we find openly a listing of the symbols and their interpretations
whatsoever... This, along with the current events and other issues, indicate a heightened
expectation for public outcry with the forthcoming events, some of which
are apparently delayed/late, as the common populus has not yet revolted
about the oil profit federal terrorists, nor other issues... The concern, is for the 40% population who comprehends the existance of
emergency response protocol, and the 2% that will actually do something
about it, there is absolutely no publications currently with any
information on this topic. FEMA has eliminated print/stock, the nuke
warning symbols are still posted, but only for power-plant issues. CD/etc
are all whitewashed... Now, with this said... I know this symbol (from Fox) as being a warning
that the xmit arrays and content feeds have been compromised... It has been
standard since half a centuary ago... Applied, theorhetically, to the
server array, if corporate isnt under siege.
Now in the current time of war, when most of this is actually going to be
put to use for the first time, and we need it (prior, of course, to going
to the concentration camps (see '90's policy)) ... it is very obvious that
*someone*gestapo*terrorist*feds* has eliminated virtually all digital
information on all emergency, logistic, and any other related topic
whatsoever... Google looses content constantly, we know what happened to
archive.org's repositories from last fall, etc... And the only thing I have left of the CD/EMS indicators is an old photocopy
with a few of the generic decals... So what does a simple human do when entities start declaring omega
privleges in attempt to save the population?
Or have the doomsday logistics been effectively terminated by the feds as
I'm gonna bet hanging an amerikan flag upside down is now treason and
punnishable by on-site rifle blasts to the back of the head.

@_subject: [WLG]: Regarding HAARP Technologies 
[Repost Openly.]
Though my knowledge of various technologies that are sometimes called
"HAARP" type weapons or technologies associated thereto due to
technological similarities is vast, some recent events should be thoroughly
examined and publicised in order to prevent large-scale mass-destruction
issues or stimulators of global conflict.
Let us start with an examination of fact:
Pull up NOAA Weather maps for the weeks around the 1st of August, 2002.
Notice a large "Tropical storm" in the northern Gulf Coast (South-eastern
USA), one that does not move for over a week.
Notice, in this storm development, that regardless of strong jetstream,
altitude winds to the east/etc in significant force for cloud motion in all
other regions in parallel fashion, this storm cluster did NOT move or
change physical arrangement for almost a whole week.
Note, in the storm layout, 3 distinct clusters of high-energy storms,
static in their position and relation to each other.
During this time period, *Vatican* arrives in New Orleans with full
enterage, after a trip through Mexico, and has both ground teams and
"highly relevant people" blanketing the city. So extensive were their
operations, that on numerous occasions in my wanderings through the
Quarter, was I almost hit by a speeding Vatican security transport vehicle.
Vatican had, at the least, 4 *Large* ships, and a number of "support"
vessels, off the coast of New Orleans and Biloxi (MS).
In addition, 4 independant religious groups had additional large vessels
within the same region, some "restocking" for missionary operations
southward, others with unknown relevance. (Not even including the typical
few hundred industrial and transport vessels.)
More Facts:
Historicly, the city of New Orleans has a number of significant social,
business, and mainly religious purposes.
New Orleans is founded as the Catholic and Protest churches of europe
engage large-scale war and whatnot, as a haven and secure location for the
storage of both the individuals of high religious significance and their
genetic lines, as well as a LARGE ammount of physical items "stolen" from
the religious facilities and placed away in safe keeping.
These facts of the city's history are public knowledge; charged with the
protectorate thereof, are a LARGE number of social organizations and
related business operations, of global scale, typically considered
"undesirable" entities for cover, many engagued in the global drug empires
and Stateside illicit operations {MOB/Mafia - type operations, covert
intel, counter-intel groups within the FBI, CIA, DEA/DOJ, etc
(Counter-FEDERAL), and a plethra of others. A large majority of corporate
research divisions and related high-industry are also logisticly controlled
from social central groups from/of this city. No less the Media industry.)
The religious implications, are that by definition in a LARGE number of
religious texts, ranging from the Bible through Far-East prophecies, and
all in between, the primary trigger to indicate the "End of the World" is
the *flooding* of a major city designed and charged with the protection and
safety of these various above things.
New Orleans, intentionally, is built below sea level, has a massive vault
and storage structure extending hundreds of feet below the old city, and
remains home to the majority of counter-intel operatives while not on
active duty, no less being a primary port of transport for narcotics
distribution into a majority of the US under federal operations (top level
pre-cut distribution).
I shall let you connect the logic here, but I suggest you review the
*latest* year's worth of mass-media content, most specificly, the Music and
Music Video industries.
Music Videos: the most effective distribution mechanism of concepts and
whatnot immediately into the core of the social population of the US/etc.
Let us check, for example, "Creed" "My Sacrifice" and related videos, their
website has the video available, if you don't see it elsewhere.
The theater, is "State Pallace Theater" (which in reality, currently has no
sign in front), the rest of the buildings there, are all Canal Street of
New Orleans, LA, USA.
Profetic? Not unless someone floods the city.
The relevance extends to approximately 80% of the current mass-media
releases, beit explicit video references such as this, or in
word-interpretation of the vocal tracks.
Now lets just say, with the culmination of a LOT of issues that week, would
it not be effective for such entities as christianity's largest church,
coupled with the current dictatorship of the USA, to effectively flood out
a religious-based city in order to start a massive religious war?
War is good for churchs. The current Nazi regime seems to be failing in
starting large-scale religious-motivated wars. ("Islam did it!")
Why not try to flood out a city of known significance? (Im concerned with
the numerous physical devices left both upstream and on the backwater by
the Vatican and their affiliates under religious guise, which most likely
include LARGE explosive charges.)
Now go back to your weather maps...
How, do tell, could 3 storms exist in exactly the same location and layout
for over a week naturally?
Now, if per chance, you stuck a stick vertically into a stream, would there
not be "trailing" ripples from doing such?
What if this "stick" is an artificial cloud generating apparatus or
resulting physical ramifications thereof?
Do you see windward trailing ripples in the satilite and weather imagry?
Now, granted I publicly started referencing these issues that week, and
directly to some of the priest-type people (Im not gonna say covert, but
they sure as hell weren't serving as tourists...) wandering around that
I'll leave out the rest of the more pertinant issues, and allow you to
ponder the above.
Ponder this publicly.
