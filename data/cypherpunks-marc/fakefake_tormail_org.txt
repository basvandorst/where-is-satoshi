Bridges make sense if EC2 has enough IP addresses and the censurer doesn't
ban the whole range.
Too many relays give too much power to one host and violate diversity.

Good pointing at this. Gets much too less attention.
You need much less wiretapping orders. Just one. Wiretap the internet
exchange point and get any Tor user.

@_subject: [tor-talk] registration for youtube, gmail over Tor - fake voicemail / sms anyone? 
I wanted to register for youtube. For comments, voting... Youtube wants a
gmail account...
Failed to make a gmail account. Gave them alternate mail, correct
captcha... First thing after registration they want is sms or phone
verification... I have no such thing as anonymous user.
Do you know any free voicemail server for use with Tor and gmail?
Do you know any free sms receiver number for use with Tor and gmail?
Just want to use it... I don't plan to abuse something. I am willing to
solve 1000 captcha or 1000 pictures with cats and dogs. Just give me the
freaking account. Did google finally turn evil and wants to forbid any
anonymous users?
Can anyone help?
