Tell me more Do you know any Stepford wives? Are you one? For Joanna, her husband, Walter, and their children, the move to lovely Stepford seems too good to be true. It is. For behind the towns idyllic façade and seemingly perfect, beautiful housewives lies a secret so frightening no one who encounters it will ever be the same.
Back by popular demand and now a major film release, this "modern classic" from internationally bestselling author Ira Levin (Rosemarys Baby, The Boys from Brazil) is a masterpiece of psychological suspense and a savage commentary on a society that values the pursuit of youth and beauty-at all costs.
