Try datum.com...they offered a sponsor pitch at intl financial
cryptography in Bermuda two weeks ago. Unlike most of the academic (and
irrelevant) debate I've seen on this issue lately, their products seem

 plainly shows a thumbprint is not used by the drive
at all.  The 'secure' version prompts a user for a password to access a
thumb drive folder, but doesn't tie into any form of biometrics.  As for
a forensic copy, a memory dump to RAM then back to another thumb drive
might be possible, but this would require special software (not
difficult to produce.)
