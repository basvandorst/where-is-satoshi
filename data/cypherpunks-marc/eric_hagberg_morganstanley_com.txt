Filed one on Saturday.
Of course I can do that, but there are _many_ more packages than just
glibc and glibc-common that have this same problem - ie all the other
packages installed for 32-bit compatibility.

Unfortunately, you won't be able to do this from behind a firewall on an
AS 3.0 machine - elinks doesn't seem to support https through a proxy

I know there's supposed to be a way to grab the other architectures' rpms
using up2date as well, though either the syntax has changed or it has
escaped my memory.
For example, I thought you'd be able to pull the new i686 glibc package
with "up2date-nox --get glibc-2.3.2-74.i686" but that is either broken now
or I've got the command syntax wrong.
Can someone from Red Hat comment on this? It makes it pretty much
impossible/painful to upgrade some key parts of the OS now.
(you can download directly from RHN via a web browser... go to the
Software tab, select all channels, pick your channel and then go to the
package you want)

Hmmm. once again an issue w/ up2date and x86_64:
# up2date-nox -u glibc
Fetching package list for channel: rhel3-beta1-as-x86_64...
Fetching Obsoletes list for channel: rhel3-beta1-as-x86_64...
Fetching rpm headers...
Testing package set / solving RPM inter-dependencies...
There was a package dependency problem. The message was:
Unresolvable chain of dependencies:
glibc-2.3.2-70                           requires glibc-common = 2.3.2-70
I imagine this is due to multiple arch copies of glibc being updated.
What's the syntax for up2date needed to specify grabbing the rpm for a
specific arch other than your native one?
