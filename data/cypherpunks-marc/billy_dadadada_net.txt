Is this *really* true?  Have you tried it?
The beat frequency is an amplitude envelope around the 30kHz tone
(think AM).  No part of its spectrum falls within audible range.
It shouldn't be audible at all.

What does that have to do with transitivity?
You didn't mention transitivity when you posed the question.
Ridiculous.  '*' is an operator, not a relation.
Relations can't be parenthesized unless you're going to
make truth or falsehood a symbol to be operated upon.
Tim is right.  Cypherpunks isn't a place to look for help with your
algebra homework.  I like doing interesting math problems, but
you're not even properly asking the questions you want answered.
That makes it a LOT less fun.
This is getting stupid.  The '*' operator was defined associative.
The property of associativity applies to ASSOCIATIONS between symbols
(i.e binary operators).
I'm totally done with this.

Okay, I'll try to be more careful.  They are given a choice by the copyright
holders to either pay more than we do OR to not get a subscription.
Is this not the case?
Books and magazines aren't guarded by cryptogremlins the way digital
media could be.  The cryptogremlins are embedded, "tamperproof", and are
given absolute authority over their assigned treasure by the DMCA.
Your position is that there is a difference between the set of lending
restrictions imposed by vanilla copyright law and the set of lending
restrictions imposed by private library subscription contracts with
print publishers.  Yes, agreed.
I'm saying that there is an even wider difference between the lending
restrictions on the gremlin-guarded digital media versus those on
printed media.  You usually don't have to talk your way past a robotic
Pat Schroeder avatar to read a printed book, as you do with an encrypted
scientific journal on DVD.  Some of these journals have announced that
they will be discontinuing their print editions altogether because they
are fed up with libraries letting the public look at them.  Some of the
digital publications you might ask for at a university library are
boobytrapped and crisscrossed with razor-sharp bardwire (not a typo).
Librarians can't let you see it unless they have a way to bill you.
If we're looking for a model on which to base this homebrew
personal-computer/digital-lending-library, think of how "REAL" lending
libraries are handling digital content.  Suddenly considering yourself a
one-man library doesn't give you any new liberties than you had as an
individual, when it comes to DRM.  They are dealing with the same
problems that we are dealing with.  If you go to the Library of Congress
and protest outside of the DMCA review hearings, librarians will shake
your hand and congratulate you on your patriotism.
The way I see it, we're taking two leaps here.. One leap is thinking of
ourselves as individuals with the same rights as libraries under law.
This first leap has landed firmly.  The second leap is thinking of our
personal MP3s and digital media licenses (let's say online journal
subscriptions, IEEE spec PDFs, or eBooks) on the same terms as we would
consider our IKEA bookshelf of printed material.  This second leap isn't
looking so good from where we stand in 2003.
I think of my PDA as a library.  Hell, I'm Johnny fuckin' Appleseed.
Most people are pretty generous with beaming apps and data around.  You
need X?  What do you know, I have X.  Here you go...  Just hold still
for 5 ... more ...  seconds ...  OK.  Enjoy.  My PDA already has a slot
for SD cards.  If the crypto-Nazis wanted to put a robot guard on my IR,
BT, and USB ports, I don't know that I could stop them.
