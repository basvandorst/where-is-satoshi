I can't directly speak to RTMFP since I haven't seen the spec or read
the code, but if their isn't a public spec, then you can only trust
Adobe and Flash itself.
That said, are you seriously asking if Adobe Flash =3D=3D Secure?  Because
I'm trying to think of any piece of software which has had as many
security vulnerabilities in the last 3 years... oh, that's right,
Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Seriously, Adobe products have a horrible security history.
