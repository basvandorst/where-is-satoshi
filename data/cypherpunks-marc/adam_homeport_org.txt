Yes.  I think there are reasonably simple, and unblockable ways to make 2-way
untracable any "open" ecash system, where, like cash, everyone is a
merchant.  But not that I said untracability and fraud prevention, and its really the latter half that I think is hard to solve.
This is the risk; we disagree on the solution.  Buyers and sellers at
flea markets are not untracable or unlinkable in the sense that is
possible with a MIX.  If I give you money at a flea market, I can
stand there and yell and scream if you then don't give me the goods.
Its hard to abandon your table of stuff and flee if you don't want to
settle.  Thats not the case with a bi-directional, fully anonymous
I'm very fond of market solutions for problems.  When dealing with
money, the fundamental things that you can trade are liquidity and
risk.  Banks loan money and accept a risk of non-payment.  They set
their interest rates such that, having spent time evaluating the risk,
they expect to make money.  (Dan Geer wrote a nice essay on this
subject for a talk at DCSB in November 98).  Banks use a multitude of
methods to control and manage risks, and at the end of most of those
methods is that, with sufficient energy, you can track down a person
or legal entity to get a refund of your payments.  Thats not generally
how they work; usually they try up front to ensure that the inbound
money is good, via tools like certified transfers and letters of
introduction and credit, etc.  (Frank Abagnale exploited this, and
tells his story in the enjoyable and worthwhile "Catch me if you
can.")  Over time, or with collateral, a bank will loan you money.
Some will loan you money sight unseen, based on a risk calculation.
But back to ecash.  Who will assume risk for an anonymous merchant?
(No one needs to assume risk on the withdrawl; in all systems, you
withdraw from an account, and in the good systems, blind the coins
so the bank doesn't know what coins came from what account.  The bank
can decide if its going to let you get valid coins.)  The risk is not
that the merchant is getting bad money; thats controllable; the risk
is that the merchant is not delivering the goods.  Given the merchants ability to completely disappear, who can sensibly offer a risk
guarantee?  There are ways that someone might be able to offer a
guarantee; for example, require that the merchant post a bond.
However, that doesn't work; complete anonymity incurs delays and
bandwidth costs, and it will be possible to scale an attack such that
the merchant walks off with more than the value of the bond.
Now, the people who understand this best are the ones that Chaum
chased and Hettinga just spent so much time with.  They get that they
want to be able to manage risk; its what they do, and they can't do
that with two-way untracable money.
So, does that means it is not possible to have anonymous merchants?
Well, that depends what you mean by anonymous.  If you mean the sort
of complete anonymity that Chaum showed was possible, I don't think
that it can be deployed.  If you mean that your merchant takes his
cash through traditional privacy measures like a private bank on
Vanuatu, then sure.  However, thats not what I think you were asking
How different are these?  In normal practice, I don't think they're
substantially different.  There's a different level of trust to be
placed in laws and tellers, and that makes many people uncomfortable
as we see those laws bend and break.  However, it makes others, the
bankers, very comfortable, that they have a risk management strategy
that they can construct.  They can chase the company, its bank, or the beneficial owners in various combinations in the event of fraud.

Survielling a bank is more expensive than a remailer, and a bank will

Nyms don't have assets.  People and legal fictions have assets.

Something about the first hundred names in the Cambridge phone book
springs to mind.
A nym is none of these.
Or these.
So here's the rub.  A nym (as I'm using the term) is control over a
private key thats associated with some reputation, which Alice is
trying to sell to Bob.  Alice can not provide direct assurance that
she won't keep copies of the thing she's selling.
Through intermediaries, Bob can buy some insurance that the revocation games Alice can play are limited.  How valuable that insurance is
depends on the trustworthiness of the intermediaries, how likely the
reliant parties are to properly check signatures, and the value of
social engineering in a field where process issues are not yet well
understood.  (See also

Right.  Now the seller has the cash, and the buyer has nothing.  The
seller has lost only the future value of the nym, which was presumably
accounted for in the price.  The seller loses no "real" reputation,
because the nym can't be tied back to the is-a-person seller.  The
buyer, meanwhile, is out the price of the nym, and must either destroy the nym in order to ensure that the seller actually loses all
that value, or accept damaged goods.
So, why would a buyer agree to such a transaction, where he will
remain at the mercy of the seller?
Or is this 'one born every minute' economics?

I think its worse than that.  The normal technology adoption curve is
that you have people ("visionaries" or "early adopters" who are
willing to use expensive technology with a high learning curve to get
something that they want.  When they get a sufficient critical mass,
you move to the early mass market.  However, with ecash you have the
problem that you need to convince not only the users who care about
their privacy, but also the merchants to accept it, and the banks to
issue it.
Consider for a moment if the telcos had to agree to support fax
machines; or perhaps if they had to agree to support DSL. (oh wait,
they do.)
Thus, ecash deployment is a 3 party problem, where most new
technologies that succeed are not.  I'm honestly not sure if the
patents make a big difference in our ability to deploy, given that
they're a small speed bump on the way to this brick wall.

Worse, patent attorneys tell me that pointing out prior art while a
patent is being 'prosecuted' tends to weaken your case against it
later if the patent examiner doesn't reject the thing whole cloth,
because now the prior art has "been considered."
The one obvious part of the answer is to raise the cost of getting
patents such that its worth the time of regular filers to consider if
they want the patent, and such that patent examiners are paid well
enough that they don't all leave in 3 years.  (I say regular filers
because there may be a good argument that small inventors should not
be shut out of the system.  Of course, they already are, because its
close to impossible, even for an experienced practitioner to avoid any
mistakes these days, which is why you often see half a dozen closely
related patents on the same invention.)
For example, IBM is granted something on the order of 1000 patents per
year.  The cost to them?  A few million dollars.  If the cost on the
50th patent was a million bucks, then perhaps they'd abuse the system
less.  I don't think Edison ever got 50 patents in a year, and lord

There is no exponential term in MIX traffic.  That means that if you
try to ensure that all traffic leaves the network quickly (so you can
say, web browse), then your attacker only needs to analyze traffic
over a few seconds, and that's easy.
Simple attacks work really well on real time mix chains of any length
that TCP timeouts are likely to allow.
As such, I'm actually very suprised that the German police bothered
with this compelled back door stuff.  Perhaps they failed to talk to
their national technical experts, or their experts failed to tell them
how easy traffic analysis is for them.

to read it. (which, after all, would need to be in at least thousands
of readers, just in the US, never mind in the other 190 odd countries
which will want to verify passports..)
(From And who is going to pay for this press to read addition?  Maybe,
rather than designing with RFID, they could use a smart-card chip
which requires contact?  seems easier, no?

5 years?  I don't think we have that long.
The technology will mature *very* rapidly if Virginia makes their
driver's licenses RFID-enabled, or if the US goes ahead with the
passports.  Why?  Because there will be a stunning amount of money to
be stolen by not identity thieves, but real thieves.  Imagine sitting
with a laptop, a good antenna, and some software outside a metro
station in Virginia.  Or an upscale restaurant in Adams-Morgan,
reading off the addresses of those who will be away from home for the
next 3 hours.

There's very good evidence that Al Qaida does *not* use strong crypto.
I blogged on this at is was the first time I'd given such a talk since 9/11. It wasn't
useful after we'd made the decision to stop hemorrhaging money by
shutting down the Freedom Network. (That was May or June of 2001.) So
I did a fair bit of reading about Al Qaeda's use of crypto. One of the
more interesting techniques I found was the 'draft message' method.
It seems consistent that Al Qaeda prefers being 'fish in the sea' to
standing out by use of crypto. Also, given the depth and breadth of
conspiracies they believe in, it seems that they might see all us
cryptographers as a massive deception technique to get them to use bad
crypto. (And hey, they're almost right! We love that they use bad
There's other evidence for this. In particular, the laptops captured
have been exploited very quickly, in one case by a Wall St Journal
reporter. So rumors of steganography or advanced crypto techniques
have a burden of proof on them.

Nope!  All you have to do is exploit your attack and steal money in
realtime.  A securid has no way to authenticate its server, and what's
really needed to stop phishing is server auth.
