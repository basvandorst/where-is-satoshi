 LOW COST COMPUTER INVENTORY
POSTING & EMAIL BROADCASTING SITE Fellow Traders: I have previously broadcasted
  and/or posted inventory on websites including: CCICLS, ATC, Vendorbase,Tradeloop,
  The Computer Exchange among others. Where they have all been reputable and have
  given me exactly what they said they would the cost ranges from $79-$149 per
  month and all I have basically paid for is the privilege to post / source product
  and email broadcast. Below is information on
  a site that does the above for $29.95 and also offers: Inspection Services,
  Purchase Order Funding, Freight Options, Escrow Services, Warehousing, Credit
  Reports, unlimited domestic business telephone service ($99.95/ mo), Medical
  Dental Plan, and Vehicle Leasing. Ie to plug in to the ancillary services, the
  site is providing inventory posting/sourcing and email broadcasting at 38%-79%
  LESS THAT WHAT WE PRESENTLY PAY!
THE INSPECTION SERVICE
  IS WORTH IT ALONE ! I am tired of having product constantly misrepresented to
  me. This one feature could protect us all. Click here for Traders
  Broadcast Network, please take a look and hopefully a test drive (FREE FOR
  60 DAYS)
