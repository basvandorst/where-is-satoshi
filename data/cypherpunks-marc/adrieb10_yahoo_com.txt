When you install MySQL, there is a default user account with a blank name. This user does not have the necessary rights to create a database.
try logging in executing: c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root
The root user has the necessary rights
I executed c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe
and then I typed in: create database learnsql;
and this is what appeared: ERROR 1044: Access denied for user: ' to database 'learnsql'
Please help me with this problem
