You faggots think we're safe ?
A surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating
that target with a pulsed laser light, and measuring the reflected
pulses with a sensor. Differences in laser return times and wavelengths
can then be used to make digital 3D-representations of the target.""
A real-time acquisition and processing architecture for an ultrawideband
(UWB) S-band (2â4 GHz) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) phased
array radar system that facilitates greater than 10 Hz imaging rates,
providing a video-like radar image of what is behind a concrete wall.""
Video framerate imaging is achieved by designing an electronically
switched bi-static array using high-performance microwave components, a
multi-threaded data pipeline, and efficient hardware-accelerated
processing algorithms.""
Experiments successfully image low radar cross section (RCS) objects,
fast moving objects in free-space, and a human behind a 10 cm-thick
solid concrete wall.""
