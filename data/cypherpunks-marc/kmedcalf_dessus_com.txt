Actually, the last time November 16th fell on a Sunday would have been in 2008.
So fifty-four weeks ago ...

This doesn't only apply to "SmartPhones".  The most widely used Operating S=
ystem (by this I mean Windows) has been issued pre-compromised and has "int=
entionally implanted compromise via Vendor Update" for many years.  It is o=
nly unethical when a non-American does it.  The excuses and justifications =
are no different.

This will never work.  The "vested profiteers" will all get together and ma=
ke it a condition that in order to use this method the user has to have "pu=
rchased" a "verified" key from them.  Every site will use different profite=
ers (probably whoever gives them the biggest kickback).  You will end up pa=
ying thousands of dollars a year (as a user) to buy multiple keys from the =
profiteers, and provide them all sorts of private information in the proces=
s.  They will then also insist that web sites using this method provide "tr=
acking" information on key usage back to the profiteers.  The profiteers wi=
ll then sell all this information to whomever they want, for whatever purpo=
se, so long as it results in a profit.  Some of this will get kicked back t=
o participating web sites.  Then there will be "affiliate programs" where a=
ny web site can "sign up" with the profiteers to "silently" do key exchange=
s without the users consent so that more tracking information can be collec=
ted, for which the participating affiliate web site will get a kickback.  B=
rowser vendors will "assist" by making the whole process transparent.  Cont=
racts in restraint of trade will be enforced by the profiteers to prevent a=
ny browser from using the "method" unless it is completely invisible to the=
 user.
Then (in the US) the fascist government will step in and require "registrat=
ion" of issued keys along with the verified real-world identity linkage.
If it does not use self-generated unsigned keys, it will never fly.

Sure it does.  You have confidentiality between the parties who are speaking together agai=
nst third-parties merely passively intercepting the communication.
Authentication and Confidentiality are two completely separate things and c=
an (and are) implemented separately.
The only Authentication which would be of any value to me is if the certifi=
cates was issued by me to the other party.  Otherwise, one must assume that=
 the certificate is fake for the purposes of authentication (ie, has no mor=
e value than a self-signed certificate).
