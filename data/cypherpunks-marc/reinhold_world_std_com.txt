The big argument for a crypto ban is "the need for intelligence." Yet Jane Garvey, the head of the FAA, was quoted on the radio (WBUR) this morning as saying the FAA's security measures were not designed to stop someone who was willing to die in an attack.  If the steady stream of suicide bombings in the middle east in the past year was not considered a credible indication of a new threat, what would be needed? An intercepted status report on the plan from Bin Ladin himself?  When a stolen nuclear weapon is set off on a yacht in the East River, we'll no doubt be told they never thought about the boat The "intelligence" that is needed is the brain power kind, not the information kind.

You make a good argument for dropping the non_U.S. only restriction. The risk may be worth the benefits of kernel integration.  That could result in wider corporate use of IPSec to fight real security threats and make it much more difficult, politically, to suppress.
My point was just that one cannot rely on the U.S. courts striking down any future crypto regulations. They should and I hope they would, but it not a sure thing. The most recent ruling is not favorable. I also wouldn't underestimate the U.S. government's ability to stifle crypto development if they choose to do so and get a green light from the courts.  Note today's Warez crackdown.
Maybe there is some compromise possible where a core crypto library is kept free of U.S. contributions?

It seems to me that a very similar argument can be made regarding the need (or lack there of) for a national identity card.  Organizations that require biometric identity can simply record that information in their own databases. The business most widely cited as needing national ID cards, the airlines, already maintain elaborate customer databases for their frequent flyer programs. Adding biometrics, with mileage points or faster check-in as incentive, would be easy enough. Your frequent flyer application would authorize the airline to compare your  identifying data with security databases at other airlines, credit bureaus, the government, etc.
If photo matching software is unable to validate two photos of you from different databases, both would be displayed next time you check in. If the clerk decides they match, that would be recorded. If the discrepancy is major, you would be taken aside and the matter investigated. Over time, the confidence in any individual's record would grow as more use is made of it. There is still the problem of protecting the database from alteration, but that applies to whatever database would be used to issue national ID cards as well.
Even if high speed data lines are not available at all gates, reservations are normally made well in advance, so a passenger list with biometrics could be prepared overnight and delivered to each gate in printed form (for photos) or on a CD-RW.  Last minute reservations could be handled by slower data links or the maker would simply be subject to a higher level of scrutiny. Passport numbers could be requested at the time of an international reservation and checked with the issuing government well before flight. Government's that don't cooperate would have their citizens subject to additional scrutiny. During times of heightened alert, additional cross checking can be implemented.
None of this is particularly hard and all the issues of of forged, revoked, stolen or cursorily examined ID cards go away. So do the issues of abuse where petty officials confiscate your ID card leaving you helpless.

The point is that the risks are not the same. A CA can lower the cost of insurance it sells by taking additional precautions to reduce risk.  The CA is also in a better position to estimate the true premium. A third party has to charge a very high premium since it is in a poorer position to make an accurate assessment of the risk.
There would be a way for third parties to reduce their risk if some simple mechanism existed for independent verification of certificates. I once proposed that all PGP users display a small card containing their key fingerprint in a window near their front door. The corporate equivalent would be for organizations to display a hash of a master signing key in their main and branch lobbies. Anyone could then verify this key if they wanted to. There might be a bounty for discovering any irregularity. A network of certificate insurers might develop who would go from office to office recording fingerprints  and then selling lists by subscription along with a guarantee of reimbursement for damages up to a certain amount if any of their data were incorrect.

Circumvention is defined in 17 USC 1201 (a) (3):
"As used in this subsection - (A) to ''circumvent a technological measure'' means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; ...
I'd read that as implying that the law is talking about a copyrighted work; otherwise if someone encrypts text in the public domain, no one would be allowed to decrypt it. But an aggressive prosecutor might adopt your interpretation. It's a very poorly written law with great potential for abuse.

Arabic Unicode is based on ISO 8859/6 so this was presumably the case before Unicode as well.
I'm not sure why someone would only write the root. I don't think it's any more natural for speaker of those languages than writing Latin roots would be for English speakers.
A few more factors:
1. Neither Hebrew nor Arabic have capitalization the way Latin does. This reduces opportunities for variation. The Hebrew final forms make up for that to a small degree.  They are treated as different code points in all encodings*, by the way.
2. Almost all Hebrew encodings* include the Latin letters as well. In 7-bit ASCII Hebrew, the Hebrew alphabet replaces the lowercase Latin letters. In IBM-PC and ISO 8859/8  encodings, the Hebrew alphabet is in the upper 128 characters, with the lower 128 printable characters being standard ASCII. So a Hebrew user could mix Latin and Hebrew characters if they wished.  I suspect most Arabic computer users have easy access to Latin characters too.
3. Arabic and Hebrew users might be counseled to selectively use vowels or diacritical marks in their passwords.
4. People outside the U.S. are less likely to be mono-lingual. Someone from Israel for example might be expected to know several languages among Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, English, Russian, Yiddish and Ladino.
5. Unicode includes an extended Arabic-encoding with 96 additional letter/diacritic forms used in non-Arabic languages that use Arabic alphabet, including 9 for Pashto. I don't know if these are available in consumer PC's yet.
6. Finally users of these or other non-Latin alphabet languages might well choose to transliterate their password into Latin characters to make them easy to enter on any computer.
I think the analysis depends on the type of password system employed. In a properly designed system that places no restriction on password length and applies a cryptographic hash to the password input + ample salt, the existence of constant bits per character in some encodings has no effect. The entropy of the password is determined by the symbol space the user is employing, not the internal encoding.
Systems like these are probably best attacked by trying long lists of likely passwords, preferably guided by whatever personal information is known about the password creator.
If the password bit length is limited to a low number, e.g. the Unix 56-bit limit,  switching to 16-bit or 32-bit per character encoding would be disastrous. As far as I know, no one does this. I don't know if any implementations attempt to accept UTF-8 encoding. There are clearly some pitfalls there.
On the other hand, the Unix password system, particularly those where the hashed password can be obtained by an attacker, is so broken that any natural language password is going to be weak.  Random 8 character passwords from a 26 letter alphabet, will only have 38 bits of entropy.  A dictionary attack is quite feasible at that size. A random password with 6 letters, one digit and one special character (typical of what users are counseled to choose) has 42 bits.  A random password using the full 96 printable ASCII character set only gets you to 53 bits of entropy. Stamping out the 8 character Unix password limit would be a good use of Homeland Defense money.

You can presumably write your own programs to decrypt your own files. But if you provide that service to someone else you could run afoul of the law as I read it. The DMCA prohibits trafficking in technology that can be used to circumvent technological protection measures. There is no language requiring proof than anyone's copyright was violated.  Traffic for hire and it's a felony.
Now a prosecutor probably wouldn't pursue the case of a cryptographer who decoded messages on behalf of parents of some kid involved in drugs or sex abuse. But what if the cryptographer was told that and the data turned out to be someone else's? Or if the kid was e-mailing a counselor about abuse by his parents? Or the government really didn't like the cryptographer because of his political views?
There is also the argument that Congress only intended to cover tools for breaking content protections schemes like CSS and never intended to cover general cryptanalysis.   You might win with that argument in court (I think you should), but expect a 7 digit legal bill.  And if you lose, we'll put up a "Free Will" web site.
Correct. The Barniki opinion pointed out that the journalists were not responsible for the interception.  But journalists receive purloined data from whistle-blowers all the time. Suppose in the future it was one of those e-mail messages with a cryptographically enforced expiration date? A journalist who broke that system might be sued under DMCA.  That possibility might not frighten the WSJ, but what about smaller news organizations?

This law has LOTS of unintended consequences.  That is why many people find it so disturbing.  For example, as I read it, and I am *not* a lawyer, someone who offered file decryption services for hire to people who have a right to the data, e.g. the owner lost the password, or a disgruntled employee left with the password, or a parent wants to see what was stored on their child's hard drive, could still be charged with committing a felony.
As for the legal situation before the DMCA,  the Supreme Court issued a ruling last year in a case, Barniki v. Volper,  of a journalist who broadcast a tape he received of an illegally intercepted cell phone conversation between two labor organizers.  The court ruled that the broadcast was permissible.  So the stolen property argument you give might not hold. The change wrought by the DMCA is that it makes trafficking in the tools needed to get at encrypted data, regardless whether one has a right to (there is an exemption for law enforcement) unlawful.

One of the services that Palladium offers, according to the talk announcement, is:
It seems to me such a service requires that Palladium be secure against the local user. I think that is the main goal of the product.
Brian mentioned that the system will not be secure against someone who can access the memory bus.  But I can see steps being taken in the future to make that mechanically difficult. The history of the Scanner laws is instructive. Originally one had the right to listen to any radio communication as long as you did not make use of the information  received. Then Congress banned the sale of scanners that can receive cell phone frequencies. Subsequently the laws were tightened to require scanners be designed so that their frequency range cannot be modified.  In practice this means the control chip must be potted in epoxy.  I can see similar steps being taken with Palladium PCs. Memory expansion could be dealt with by finding a way to give Palladium preferred access to the first block of physical memory that is soldered on the mother board.
Brian also mentioned that there would be changes to the Southbridge LCP bus, which I gather is a local I/O bus in PCs.  SCP will sit on that and presumably the changes are to insure that the SCP can only be accessed in secure mode.
There are two cases here. One is a buffer overflow in one of the trusted "agents" running in Palladium. Presumably an attack here will only be able to damage vaults associated with the product that contains that agent.  The vendor that supplies the agent will have a strong incentive to avoid overflow opportunities.
The more dangerous case is  buffer overflow in Nexus. Brian admitted that this would be disastrous.  Obviously QA will be intense. They plan to publish Nexus source code. Brian was even asked if they would publish source for their C compiler. He said they had thought of that, didn't think they could get the VisualC compiler published but are considering coming up with a stripped down C compiler they can They realize that the whole back up/upgrade issue is a big concern. Brian briefly presented some very complex schemes for doing this which I didn't grasp.
Presumably an intact Nexus can trash any trusted app.  And I don't see how any data in the vault could prevent you from loading a clean nexus, say from CD-ROM, as long as the SCP isn't altered and there is supposed to be no way to do that from software..

One approach to securing infrequent signing or working keys from a corporate master certificate is to store the certificate in a bank safe deposit box. The certificate generation software (say on a self booting CD or perhaps an entire laptop) could be stored in the safe deposit box as well. The certificate signing would take place at the bank, either in one of the small rooms they provide or in a borrowed conference room.
This approach buys a large amount of physical security and an audit trail for the process at very minimal cost. It  also addresses another thorny problem: how to  match the control of a corporate master certificate to corporate governance mechanisms.  Board members of most corporations are poor potential custodians  of cryptographic material. Any password sharing system runs the risk of what to do if the secret holders are all fired.  Banks, on the other hand, are used to dealing with situations like changing access controls after a major management shakeup.

I can see one potential problem with having the machine produce the receipts. Let's say the system is well designed and completely fair. There will be a certain percentage of voters who will complain that the receipt recorded the wrong vote because they in fact inadvertently pressed the wrong button.  Over time, that percentage and its variance will become well known.  Call that rate "r.' A party with the ability to make surreptitious changes to the voting software can then have it occasionally record a vote and print a receipt contrary to what the voter chose as long as the number of such bogus votes is small enough relative r and its variance to escape notice. They can then determine what fraction, f, of voters who get wrong receipts  report them. They can then increase the fraction of bogus votes by 1/f.  Over the course of several elections they can slowly grow the fraction of bogus votes, claiming that voters are getting sloppy. Since major elections are often decided by less than one percent of the vote, this attack can be significant.
We have a system now in Cambridge, Massachusetts where we are given a paper mark sense ballot and fill in little ovals, like those on standardized tests. We then carry our ballot to a machine that sucks it in and reads it. The totals are reported after the polls close, but the mark sense ballots are saved inside the machine (which I assume is inspected before the voting starts and then locked) can easily be recounted at any time. This system seems ideal to me.
A important thing to remember is that these poll watchers, along with the workers running the voting for the election authorities are often retired people who have very little computer skills. It is much easier for them to understand and safeguard systems based on paper and mechanical locks.

From the Skype FAQ "Is the source code for Skype available? Can I have a copy?
No. Skype is proprietary and closed-source software."
In a closed source system it is certainly possible for the authors to provide "backdoors" that would allow wiretapping.  There are many ways to do this. Perhaps the simplest way is to constrain the random number generator to select values from a limited, searchable set of possibilities. The constraint might be turned on by receipt of a special message.
The backdoor could be included in all copies of the program  or just selected copies, particularly if there are provisions for automatic updates. A backdoor could also be delivered as a virus or worm.
If the authorities can gain one-time physical access to one of the computers in the Skype network, all encrypted communication to and from that computer as an end point can be compromised regardless of how well Skype has designed its system (this does not include messages relayed by that computer if Skype has done things right).
This is not to suggest that Skype is a bad product or that all open-source encryption solutions are safe, but a closed-source system is only as trustworthy as its authors.

I would say quite practical. A huge advantage for the attacker is that 802.11b/g is in a fixed frequency band. A half-wave dipole is 6.25 cm long. A large phased array could be assembled out of printed circuit board tiles, each with many antennas.
The outdoor range for 802.11 is up to 100 m.  Low earth orbit is about 150 km.  That is a factor of 1500. Power attenuation is the square of that, which works out to a 64 db loss.  Throw in another 10 db for slant range, building attenuation, etc. The loss has to be made up by a combination of antenna gain, improved receiver performance and better signal processing. That doesn't sound undoable.
A single LEO satellite would only have a few minutes of visibility per day over any one location on Earth. That suggests an active attack, where the satellite looks for files or even changes data. The satellite's ability to transmit at much higher power levels is an A third option is spot jamming. Here high power means one can get away with a smaller antenna, perhaps wrapped around a cheaper spin stabilized satellite.  Such a system could be used to briefly disable 802.11-based security systems, perhaps allowing a spy to gain access to a building.
Other interesting possibilities include long endurance remotely-piloted aircraft, balloons and small receiving stations that could be planted by spies or even parachuted into position. I'm sure 802.11 has given the SIGINT community much joy.
