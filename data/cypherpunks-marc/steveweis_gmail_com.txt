Was there a question that remote attestation would be removed from TPM
2.0? I assumed it would continue to be included, but perhaps I'm
Remote attestation works on TPM 1.2 with TXT as you describe. You can
bring up a remote host and measure the BIOS, OptROMS, SINIT, MLE,
kernel, boot parameters, initrd, etc.
We have this working in practice on some dedicated hosting providers.
There are some security caveats and vendor-specific nits, though.

I think that compromising microcode update keys is a much more
interesting and believable prospect than compromising RDRAND.
I've seen surprisingly little research around microcode update
security. This post by Ben Hawkes is pretty interesting:

I think this is a weak guess.
The document is talking about FY2013.  IVB already shipped in 2012. I'd
guess it was fabricated for testing in 2009-2010 and designed for a few
years prior.
What enablement would be "complete" in 2013 for something that has been on
the market a year and is already being phased out?
By 2013, Intel had already started shipping Haswell. They did launch new
IVB E5v2 Xeon server processors this fall, but future CPUs will be Haswell
and Broadwell.
Intel already has the next, next generation Skylake with SGX fabricated for
I still think the document is talking about a dedicated crypto chip for VPN
and SSL acceleration devices, just like it says.

Is this a guess because "Intel Ivy Bridge" fits into the redacted space or
is there some other evidence?
Ivy Bridge processors are general purpose x86 CPUs. It doesn't make sense
to me to refer to it as an "encryption chip" for "web encryption devices".
Do you know of products using IVB processors for SSL offloading or in VPN
To me, the redacted document sounds like it's referring to a security
processor used for SSL offloading. For example, something like a Cavium
Nitrox (which I'm not implying is the subject of the document).
