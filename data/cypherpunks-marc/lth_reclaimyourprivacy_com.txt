@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
Wikipedia describe "Privacy" as "the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively" - the key here being "selectively".  Using Facebook is a choice - users of Facebook chose to accept the terms.  What is, at least in some cases, not a choice is ISP's monitoring usage data of their customers and selling such data.  By using Facebook as a hidden service at least it is clearly a matter of what I choose to tell Facebook and I don't have to worry about someone else spying on the traffic.  I agree that in the end that boils down to if you trust Facebook or not :)
Personally I think it is immensely cool that Facebook did this and I can't wait to see if Twitter and/or Google feel they have to follow that one.
