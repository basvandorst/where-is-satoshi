Try naming your source file multiply.py but continue to use the module
name (multiply) in the command line.  [Note: you could have a binary
extension module called multiply in a binary file called multiply.so]
I guess the author of that manual section didn't contemplate somebody
on their first day with Python doing some embedding :-)
