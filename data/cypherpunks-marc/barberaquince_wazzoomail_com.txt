A friend of mine was giving an English lesson to a class of adult who had
recently come to live in the United States. After placing quite a number of
everyday objects on a table, he asked various members of the class to give
him the ruler, the book, the pen and so on. The class went very smoothly and
the students seemed interested and serious about the work that they were
engaged in until when my friend turned to an Italian student and said, "Give
me the kays." The man looked surprised and somewhat at a loss. Seeing this,
my friend thought that the student hadn't heard him clearly, so he repeated.
"Give me the kays." The Italian shrugged his shoulders. Then, he threw his
arms around the teacher's neck and kissed him on both cheeks.
Professor Laurie of Glasgow put this notice on his door: "Professor Laurie
will not meet his classes today."A student, after reading the notice, rubbed
out the "c". Later Professor Laurie came along, and entering into the spirit
of the joke, rubbed out the "l".
It was time for an elderly gentleman to be put into a nursing home, as his
grown children could no longer care for him.After a week, the children went
to visit their father at the nursing home. During the visit, the father
leaned to the right, and a nurse quickly came over and propped him up with a
pillow. A little while later, he leaned to the left, and again a nurse came
and propped him up with another pillow. The man's children were amazed at
how attentivethe home seemed to be, and questioned their father on how he
liked it there. He responded, "I've been treated well, but I've got to tell
you....they sure don't want you to fart here.
