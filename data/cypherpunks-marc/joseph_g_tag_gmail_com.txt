Best "intro" of CypherPunks I found was in The New York Times magazine
( mentioned PGP too ) .

The govt uses red/black switches and KG-n, KIV7hs, KIV19,(boxes) and KOV9
and more PCMIA  cards to protect themselves.  Semiconductor firms useto
make DES chips.  Boeing made an MLS server. Isn't Crypto supposed to be
incorporated into firmware of Routers? Yes, bribery of network managers (
personnel security and trust ) is a big concern.   576-bit Group Keys / Key
Encrypting Keys interest me.  Thank you. Best wishes.

In reviewing old issues of ACM-SIGSAC, ACM-SIGCOMM, and ACM-SIGACT (more
likely ACM-SIGCOMM ) I have seen discussion of
encryption protocols for networks; especially in reference to Motorola's
Network Encryption System "mail-guard / router" and also reference to
key-exhange for that and the then currrent STU-III . Best wishes to all .

I am reminded that Gretag AG ( Swiss ) now Gretacode/Omnisec made type 4
STU-3 ; partner of U.S. company Datotek ( Farmers Branch / Realty Rd;
Dallas TX ) :  modified the CSD-4100 phone. Now see
 Concord MA USA. TCC and Datotek were arch
rivals and Datotek buckled.
Datotek founded by ex Texas Instruments folks.  Also be aware of Motorola
Sectel 9600.   It is wild how Govt influences others!
IBM , DEC-Digital Equipment Corp, HP, Data General, SUN ( now Oracle ) ,
Wang Labs all made TEMPEST terminals and other equipment.
Best wishes to all. End.

All I know is that L3-Communications ( Comm.Sys.-East Division ) was at
least one company who built/used
Local Management Device/Key Processor ( LMD/KP )  combo ( LINUX Server ? )
Another website of interest is the US Navy SPAWAR Info Assurance site in
Charleston, South Carolina.

as linked, there are clues from PKCS interop which tell us about:
BATON: block cipher in use since at least 1995. 320-bit key and uses a
128-bit block in most modes, and also supports a 96-bit ECB mode. 160
bits of the key are checksum material. It supports a "shuffle" mode of
operation, like the NSA cipher JUNIPER. It may use up to 192 bits as
an initialization vector, regardless of the block size.
SAVILLE: used for voice? 128-bit key, two modes?
and per  some others?
(perhaps that last a stream cipher? ;)

Hello, Everyone.  I learn much, here.
There are three  (3) major situations where encryption is really helpful.
1) encrypting a Password in the Log-on / Access Control activity . 2)
Creating a new password or Message Authentication Code (MAC)  and   3)
Using encryption to support and provide for a Digital Signature.
As Information Technology evolved from "mainframe" computers,
"minicomputers" "LAN's" and Laptop PC's , notebook PCs were installed used
and connected around the world, so did the need for people to install and
maintain them.
Those are my concerns about when to use encryption. I always use https:/
And, with so many things; tinkering, tampering, sabotaging, tapping,
thumping, and corrupting all things techologic has occurred.     Sometimes,
I get frustrated with what I understand the legal system is NOT doing.
I should feel free to modify my use of an AES  Algorithm ( 24--64 bit
pre-whitening with Rijndael, Twofish, Serpent, RC6, MARS ) ; applying a
larger-than-standard keysize ( i.e: 384--576 bits of key ) ; in a well
engineered metal box (form factor) .    We should not feel a need to
Destroy/Zeroize our systems, when the Feds come knocking on our door.
If I encrypt messages about my plans, they should be secure until I change
them ( and escape )
It is frustrating, the current situation.  Lots of food for thought.
Best wishes to all.
