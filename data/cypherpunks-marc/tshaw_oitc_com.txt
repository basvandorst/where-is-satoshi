BTW, here is some comments on the pict from my office mate...
It doesn't show what the sweep span is ... If it's the full transponder, could be narrow band carriers ... The gain slope across the pass band looks like CRAP ... He must have a funky LNB ... If this is one carrier, then obviously theres interference  If the spikes are there, it could be radar or it could be some type of burst TDMA junk ... I have articles talking about C Band inband interference in Europe somewhere ... Brian

It can come in from other places as well. Inductance via unfiltered/poorly-filtered power, poor I/F cabling as well as via other sources. Have you tried using a spectrum analyzer to characterize the signal in the ether and compare it to what you are seeing in your systems?
