With reference to the following url
As in idea 1 what about choosing 2 independent  bit
file streams.
Then as in RFC 1750 6.1.1 A Trivial Mixing Function
(page 14),
 make a 3rd bit file stream such that We xor For i=0 to n
bit(i)file3=bit(i)file1 (xor) bit(i) file2
and follow idea 1?
Is the problem solved and idea 1 worthy?

Using Transition Mappings to De-Skew
Randomness Recommendations for Security
RFC 1750
An extract from it.....
   Another technique, originally due to von Neumann
[VON NEUMANN], is to
   examine a bit stream as a sequence of
non-overlapping pair
 pair |            probability             00  | (0.5 - e)^2          =  0.25 - e + e^2  |
  01  | (0.5 - e)*(0.5 + e)  =  0.25     - e^2  |
  10  | (0.5 + e)*(0.5 - e)  =  0.25     - e^2  |
  11  | (0.5 + e)^2          =  0.25 + e + e^2  |
 This technique will completely eliminate any bias but
at the expense
   of taking an indeterminate number of input bits for
any particular
   desired number of output bits.  The probability of
any particular
   pair being discarded is 0.5 + 2e^2 so the expected
number of input
   bits to produce X output bits is X/(0.25 - e^2).
Eastlake, Crocker & Schiller                                  [Page 12]
RFC 1750        Randomness Recommendations for
Security    December 1994
   This technique assumes that the bits are from a
stream where each bit
   has the same probability of being a 0 or 1 as any
other bit in the
   stream and that bits are not correlated, i.e., that
the bits are
   identical independent distributions.  If alternate
bits were from two
   correlated sources, for example, the above analysis
breaks down.
   The above technique also provides another
illustration of how a
   simple statistical analysis can mislead if one is
not always on the
   lookout for patterns that could be exploited by an
adversary.  If the
   algorithm were mis-read slightly so that
overlapping successive bits
   pairs were used instead of non-overlapping pairs,
the statistical
   analysis given is the same; however, instead of
provided an unbiased
   uncorrelated series of random 1's and 0's, it
instead produces a
   totally predictable sequence of exactly alternating
1's and 0's.
A few doubts regarding the above.
Another technique, originally due to von Neumann [VON
NEUMANN], is to
   examine a bit stream as a sequence of
non-overlapping pairs
What do they mean by bit stream as a sequence of non-over lapping pairs?
Also isn't idea-1 of my earlier post "Two idea's for random number generators" very similar  to this?
Wouldn't  the problem in idea 1 be solved if I choose
a bit stream as a sequence of  non-over lapping pairs?
If we choose bits  that are from a stream where each
bit has the same probability of being a 0 or 1 as any
other bit in the  stream and that bits are not
correlated, i.e., that the bits are   identical
independent distributions.
Would n't idea 1 work?

 x mod n = b
 Let's say i choose small number...  m=5  n=3  a=3  b=1  then it's  x mod 5 = 3
 x mod 3 = 1
 after trying a but you will now that x=13  but how can i solve it easier than trying all kinds
 of

 I think the effort gets too huge for larger numbers
 like:  x mod 739631974298624487 = 403861151213590046;  x mod 898793745643687546 = 206683840814855797;  x=37658765832565679345651  And I want to use it at least with 128bit numbers.
 what would be a non-trivial method of solving x in
 the
 above example.

U can choose any arbitrary seed(greater than 100 bits
as he (i forgot who) mentioned earlier.Then subject it
to the Rabin-Miller test.
Since the seed value is a very large number,it would
be impossible to determine the actual value.The
chances the intruder  find the correct seed or the
prime number hence generated is practically verly low.
Yes the effort is going to be large but why no good
reason?  Nope ,I'm under no such delusion :)

@_subject: PRNG 
well I tried to improve idea 1 for my PRNG.ItS as
posted below.
The one thing which I cannot mathametically say is how
much de-skewing is exactly obtained by putting it in
the binary tree as shown & traversing in pre-order.
it might a better to go for url since subscripts &
super scripts dont work in plain text
Any one sees any flaw in my improved PRNG ?
Two ideas for generating random numbers
Consider a non-deterministic finite acceptor or nfa
given by
M=(Q,sigma,delta,q(0),F) Q is the finite set of internal stated
sigma is the finite set of input symbols
q0 element of Q ,the initial state
F(proper subset of) Q is the set of final states
delta:q*(sigma U {lambda})->2Q, the transition
Let L be the language accepted by the nfa
Given by
L(M)={W(element of)sigma*:delta*(q0,W(intersection)F
(not) nullable)}
For our random number generator we use a n-level
ordered binary tree.
We use 4 independent bit file streams.
For that we choose any 4 plain text files
The input of each file is fed to a stop & go generator
with LSFR-1= x^128+x^7+x^2+x^1+x^0 as primitive
polynomail modulo 2
with LSFR-2=x^88+x^8+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^1+x^0 as primitive
polynomial modulo 2
with LSFR-3=x^80+x^7+x^5+x^3+x^2+x^1+x^0 as primitive
polynomial modulo 2
The pseudo random numbers generated using these 4
files are respectively put into
file1,file2,file3 & file4
files have good statistical propertied
and a correlation attack is not possible
We xor For i=0 to n
bit(i)file5=bit(i)file1 (xor) bit(i) file2 (xor)
bit(i) file3 (xor) bit(i)file4
file5 is always the input for the binry tree
If we define p(0)=0.5+e ,where e is the eccentricity
Xoring 4 bits yeild p(0)=0.5+8*(e^4)
Even for a bias of e=0.25 ,p(0)=0.5+8*(0.25^4)=0,53125
The bias diminishes from 0.25 to 0.053125 Xoring 4 bits will suffice since,by using the
alternating stop & go generator brings about high
entropy to the system of numbers.In addition we xor 4
bits together to reduce the bias.
With these 2 steps the co-rrelation & bias among bits
is significantly reduced.
The input of the binary tree is the binary stream of
It is put into a binary tree & the operations
henceforth performed are for de-skewing & removing
correlation among bits
The input symbols are entered into the ordered binary
tree such that the symbols when read from left to
right, each vertex at any subsequent level, other than
the n th level has 2 outgoing nodes. No new nodes are
created until all the nodes at any given level has 2
outgoing nodes.
Eg: AB->( 10000001 10000010) the binary equalant is
inserted into the binary tree as in figure 1.
Click here for Fig 1
If every node at the (n-1)level does not contain two
leaves make it so by padding a zero at the n th level.
Now we consider the nfa earlier defined
Now we traverse the binary tree in 'pre order ' along
with the following transition rules
delta(qk,0)->delta(qk+1,1)={qk+2} delta(qk,1)->delta(qk+1,0)={qk+2} qk+2(element of F) delta*(qi,00)->delta(qj,lambda)={qj+2} delta*(qi,11)->delta(qj,lambda)={qj+2} qj+2(element of)F and j,k are the levels of the tree
when traversed in pre order.
Pls refer fig 3.
Click here for fig 3.
delta({qx},0)={qy,qz} delta({qx},1)={qy,qz} That is,if 2 consecutive 0 s or 1 s are encountered
,we skip one level.
i.e is a lambda transition is made as in fig 3,q(z)
being a final state of the nfa. If in the input
sequence a 01 or 10 is encountered , then the next
level is also a final state of the nfa, i.e state q(y)
in fig 3
If a lambda transition has to be done from a left
leaf, the corresponding right leaf at the same level
is considered. If a lambda transition has to be done from a right
leaf, the next node according to preorder traversal
rule is considered. As an example we take Fig 1 and traverse it in
preorder along with the given transition rules to
obtain random numbers.(the levels that are being
skipped are shown in red in fig 2. Click here for fig 2
Doing so the earlier mentioned example we get i.e AB->Binary Tree representation ->Pre order
traversal with Transition Rules->10101000001 By choosing any sub tree of the given binary tree a
new set of random number generators can be generated.
Even by adding or removing a single symbol from the
input file generates a different set of random
numbers. If P(00) represents probabilty of occurance of
discarding 00.
P(00)=(0.5+e)(0.5+e)= (0.5+e)^2=0.25 + e + e^2 Similarly P(11)=(0.5-e)(0.5-e)=(0.5-e)^2=0.25 - e + e^2 The probability of any particular pair being discarded
is P(0)+P(1) =0.25+e+e^2+0.25-e+e^2=0.5+2(e^2) P(10)=(0.5 - e)*(0.5 + e)=0.25 - e^2 P(01)=(0.5 + e)*(0.5 - e)=0.25 - e^2 so the expected number of input bits to produce X
output bits is X/(0.25 - e^2).
Though we loose a few bits,the period of the LSFR's
are very large & will suffice to produce
enough pseudo random bits
By traversing the tree in pre order where the making
of the binary tree follows the above mentioned rules the bits are mixed in a non-linear fashion eliminating
correlation among bits.
The transition rules followed further reduce bias or
skew. Algorithm for the above idea
1:>Open any 4 files in binary mode
Initialise an Alternating stop & go generator with
with LSFR-1= x^128+x^7+x^2+x^1+x^0 as primitive
polynomail modulo 2
with LSFR-2=x^88+x^8+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^1+x^0 as primitive
polynomial modulo 2
with LSFR-3=x^80+x^7+x^5+x^3+x^2+x^1+x^0 as primitive
polynomial modulo 2
Acoorinding to the input of each file,their respective
outputs which are passed
throught the alternating stop & go generator are
are placed
in files namely file1,file2,file3 & file4
3:>We xor For i=0 to n
bit(i)file5=bit(i)file1 (xor) bit(i) file2 (xor)
bit(i) file3 (xor) bit(i)file4
4:>file5 becomes the input for the binry tree
The tree is contructed in such a manner that no new
levels are formed until
every node at that level has 2 outgoing nodes
5:When the tree is traversed in pre-order
if 2 consequtive 00 or 2 consequitive 11 occour,the
bits are discareded
and if consequitive 01 or 10 occours all these bits
including the next bit form part
of the output
End of algorithm
Why randomness?
The random number generated above are truly random
because of the nfa used and the transition rules applied,the alternating stop
& go generator,xoring bits of file,
the order of construction of the binary tree & its pre
order traversal
The only 2 values any node can accept are {0,1},whose
probability of occurrence is equally likely. For any
state q (i), the current input symbol is determined in
real time which is a truly random event, when we
traverse the binary tree in pre order along with the
given set of transition rules. Back Tracking & NFA to DFA conversion
(DFA - Deterministic Finite Automata)
Given the output, it is impossible to obtain the input
because of the non-determinism achieved by the
transition rules along with pre order traversal.
In the nfa presented ,the range of delta is in the
power set 2^Q, so its value is not a single element of
Q but a subset of it.
As far as nfa to dfa conversion is considered ,when we
convert the nfa to its corresponding dfa ,the dfa at
any state q only shows the set of possible states to
which transition occurs.
By exhaustive back tracking ,the actual input becomes
a subset of a very large finite set of strings .By
looking at this finite set is impossible to determine
the actual input symbol because the finite set
contains all possible set of input strings.We can only
say with confidence that the input string is in the
finite set but have no means of determining which was
our actual input.
More over because of the lambda-transitions
involved,we cannot claim the yield as a linear time
parser. As for the above mentioned,we suggest this idea for
secure pseudo random number generation and
and your comments on it are sincerely appreciated.
Random number generation from Irrational numbers
There are infinite number of primes.
The square root of all prime numbers are irrational,
i.e their decimal part is a non-repeating
non-terminating sequence(which I conjecture is random
Yes, there are other ways to generate irrational
numbers and the choice of picking up the irrational
number is left to the person choosing,of course. How
ever here I stick to square root of primes because it
is an infinite irrational set itself.
The set of square root of prime numbers, i,e
irrational numbers is infinite
We take any prime p and calculate square root (p) As an example we choose p=5
Therefore square root(5)
2.23606797749978969640917366873128..
We consider only the decimal part 23 60 67 97 74 99 78
96 96 40 91 73 66 87 31 28
Above we break the decimal into set of 2 digits
proceeding from left to right and gives us random
numbers 23, 60, 67, 97, 74, 99, 78, 96, 96, 40, 91,
73, 66, 87, 31, 28
As above we obtain 16 random numbers between 0 an 100.
By extending this idea to 3 digits, by grouping the
decimals as 3 digits we can get as many random numbers
between 0 and 1000.
This idea can be extended to any higher order.

if a/c gives remainder b 5:>to encrypt plain text p,cipher text c is calculated
as if ^ denote exponent c=p^e (mod n) 6:>to decrypt, p=c^d(mod n) We take an example, It is just for the understanding of the reader & uses
very small numbers. choose p=3 q=11 hence n=3*11=33 z=(3-1)*(11-1)=20 we find e,such that 7*e(congruent)1 (mod 20),yeilds e=3 I will try explain with the same example. 7*e=1 (mod 20) means,find e such that 20/( (7*e)-1) For this we use the euclidean algorithm & the euiler
fermat theorom The eucledian algorithm simply find the gcd of 2
numbers. here our purpose of using it is to find gcd of 2
numbers & see if they are relatively prime. Accoring to euiler-fermat theorom if gcd(a,m)=1, that
is they are relatively prime then the solution (unique mod m) of the linear
congruence ax (congruent) b (mod m) is given by x (congruent) b* ( a^(phi(m)-1)) (mod m) where phi(m)
is the euiler totient function or the euiler phi function. if(a,m)=d,then it will have d solutions modulo m. how ever we are only interested in (a,m)=1,hence 1
solution mod m. well,Just a few defenitions Defenition of Euiler Totient If n>=1 ,the euiler totient phi(n) is defined as the
number of positive integers not exceeding n that are relatively prime to n. here are just a few examples if n=1 phi(1)=1 if n=2 phi(2)=1 (only 1 is relatively prime to 2) if n=3 phi(3)=2 (1 & 2 are relatively prime to 3) if n=4 phi(4)=3 (1,2,3 are ...) if n=5 phi(5)=4 (1,2,3,4 are...) if n=6 phi(6)=2 (1,5 are...) here is a usefull property 1 might need to apply some
times phi(m*n)=phi(m)*phi(n) if gcd(m,n)=1 If a prime p does not divide a then a^(p-1) (congruent) 1 (mod p) now as in the example 7*e (congruent) 1 (mod 20) let us take e=x so, 7*x (congruent) 1 (mod 20) by eulier fermat theorom x(congruent) 1*(7^(phi(20)-1)) (mod 20) phi(20)=8.i.e there are 8 numbers less than 20 which
are relatively prime to 20 This process of computing the euiler totoient is
speeded up on a computer using the eucledian algorithm which finds gcd(a,b),for all a les than b &
count those a which are relatively prime to b whose sum gives the euiler totient. ok,so x (congruent) 1*(7^(8-1)) (mod 20) x (congruent) (7^7)mod 20 x (congruent) 823543(mod 20) 823543/20 gives remainder 3,that is 823543(mod 20)=3 therefore x=3 or e=3. this is how e is actually obtained in the above
example. the rest of the encryption & decryption are as
mentioned above,i haven't continued the example with that part since i guess u only need to
know how the key is generated. to encrypt we have 2 keys (e,n) to decrypt we have 2 keys (d,n) n=p*q is easy to calculate d is a number relatively prime to z choose a random d,test gcd(d,z) =1 using the euclidean
algorithm,continue the process till u find one. the only othe key is e,which as above explained is
found using the euiler-fermat theorom & the euclidean algorithm. In this manner e,n,d can be found for large primes as
well. Do You Yahoo!?

@_subject: Re: Diffie-Hellman and MITM 
If there is no previous shared secret,then ur
communication on an insecure network is susecptable to
the man in the middle attack.
One solution suggested against the man in the middle
attack is using the interlock protocol
InterLock Protocol Is used to foil a man in the middle attack, 1:>Alice sends Bob her public key 2:>Bob sends Alice his public key 3:>Alice encrypts her message with Bob's public
key.She sends half of the encryped message to Bob. 4:>Bob encrypts his message using Alice's public
key.He sends half of the encrypted message to Alice. 5:>Alice sends the other half of encrypted message to
Bob. 6:>Bob puts the 2 halves of Alice's message together &
decrypts it with his private key.Bob sends the other half of the message to Alice. 7:>Alice puts the 2 halves of Bob's message together &
decrypt it with her private key. Here Mallory can still substitute his own public key
for Alice & Bob . Now when he interceprs half of Alice's message,he
cannot decrypt it with his private key & re-encrypt it with Bob's public key .He must invent a
completely new message & send half of it to Bob. When he intercepts half of Bob's message to Alice,he
has the same problem. He cannot decrypt with his private key & re encrypt
with Alice's public key. By the time the second half of the message of Alice &
Bob arrive,its already too late to change the new message he invented. The conversation between Alice & Bob need to be
completely different. How ever if Mallory can mimic Alice & Bob,they might
not realise that they are being duped & may get away with his scheme
here is what i think
It is not compulsary that all the blocks of messages
must be invented by Mallory.
he only need to make the first full message  for alice
and send it to bob & vice versa.
1:>alice send bob part of 1 st block
2:>bob makes the 1 st half on his own and send to bob
& keeps alice's message
3:>now bob sends his first half of message
4:>mallory intercept it and make his own message and
send it to alice
5:>Again bob sends alice the other half of the msg
which mallory intercepts & substitue his own 2nd part
of his block
6:>the same happens when bob sends the second half of
his message to alice,mallory intercepts it and sends
his own 2 nd block to alice.
since he has send one full block to each other & has
the full block of alice's and bob's true
messages,mallory can now split  it as half and
complete the protocol
since the 1 st packet is fake,he has the true packets
of alice & bob & can complete the protocol.
All mallory would have to do is send the half of the
(n th) packet when he receives the half of (n+1)th
packet since the 1 st packet was faked by mallory.
so i dont think the interlock protocol will work in
this case.
thats how i understand it.
am i not rite?

You're on the right track.  Take several encryption
of your choice, then use a fixed IV, and the same sets
of keys,
and encrypt blocks of 0's.  For each algorithm,
compute several sets of
staticstics (a la NIST or DIEHARD).  With 100 blocks
of 10 Megabytes
(100 different keys) you should see some interesting
Remember, your question originally was "how can you
tell which not "how do you find the key".  Let us know what you
find out :-)
--yes :)

@_subject: Man in middle attack 
As far as i can extend the previous attack,i.e faking
1 packet for interlock protocol in the above 1 you
propose,extending the same attack it only takes
one and a half faked packets to launch a succefull
attack on the above proposal.
let let 1:1  indicate 1 st packet ,1st half
1:2  indicate 1 st packet , 2nd half
2:1  indicate 2 nd packet, 1st half
2:2  indicate 2nd packet , 2nd half and so on
so we are now have  1:2 and 2:1 as one complete
and so on
No:     A               M                B
1                    A->1:1           M->1:1   2    M->1:1          B->1:1           3                    A->1:2           M->1:2 4    M->1:2          B->1:2          5                    A->2:1           M->2:1
6    M->2:1          B->2:1
7                    A->2:2           ******
The blank spaces corresponding to each row indicates
that it is a sender and the other 2 are receivers.
Once Mallory receives A->2:2 ,he has 2 full packets in
hand and has faked 1 and a half packets(Step 7)
**** indicates that it is now the earler packet Bob
receives of Alice after Mallory's manupilation.
I hope that table will give some clarity.
now he can send Bob the original message of Alice.
So I think the above suggested protocol will not work.
Mallory can still get away with his scheme

i tend to disagree with this.
the hierarchy goes like
okay let us say that two bodies with mass attract each
it was an observation of a physical body,then we make
a mathametical model of the phenomenon.
Based on the mathametical model we make laws of
The mathametical observations rely on the parameters
that are taken to make the mathametical model.
if the parameters changes,the mathametical model will
have to be changed and new laws have to be brought.
with what certainy can we say that additional
parameters will not be added or removed and that the
laws of physics will stay true for ever?
If a new parameter ever gets added may be two bodies
with mass may repell each other.
can we say that these parameters will never change?

@_subject: Atmospheric noise & fair coin flipping 
Does a fair coin exist in real world?
Like as according to Allan Turing-an event is defined
by set of  certain parameters governing the event at
that instant.
by redoing the same experiment-do we always have the
same set of parameters that previously defined the
it is said that atmospheric noise is random but how
can we say for sure.
what if the parameters giverning atmospheric noise
vary frm time 2 time.
may be at a later stage an additional parameter may
govern atmospheric noise or may be a parameter may be
removed,we cant say that for sure.
like the earth & moon attract each other,no 1 knows
why,it is a physical observation & based on it we make
a matahmetical model,what if one day-2 bodies with
mass start repelling each other?
then an extra parameter would govern it & we
will have 2 change the mathametical mode considering
this additional parameter.
so can we say atmospheric noise is random or a coin
flipping is random-only because it passes die hard
test or other randomness tests-which is an indicator
of randomness with the current defenition of
parameters in determing randomness?
is there truly random or that we can say with certain
degre of confidence that they are nearly random as all
current evidence poits so.

India has 30 million middle class people.An income of
1000 US dollar per month is considered as middle
Thats one reason of strong foreign market in india.I
guess 30 million may be bigger than the population of
some countries.
According to reports the number of dirt poor people
another 25 million,that is those who are below the
povertly line,that means less than an income of 10 US
dollars per month.
This is what the report and statistics keep saying but
any daily wager gets a minimum 3 US dollars per
day,however poor he may be.
That accounts to 90 US dollar per month.Thats the
poorest you can find in india for a *working* person.
So its open to interpret what dirt poor really is.
That is still too less,considering the present cost of
living in india.
Open drains,diseases,insanitory conditions are still
visible in india-though its comming down very slowly.
Go to a govt. hospital,the sanitation and facilities
are poor,escpecially in villages.
A large portion of the indian community depend on
farming and its upto the 'rain gods' that they yield a
good harvest.
To eliminate poverty the govt. employs 5 year plans.
here is a detailed list of the plans
The govt. provides rations to all its citizens-that is
to buy basic essentials like rice,wheat,kerosene
etc... at a much lower prices that commercially
Schooling is pretty affordable to the poor in
government schools and there are enough govt schools
and provide free mid day meals for children.How ever
the state of govt schools are sad.
This year there were over 500 cases of food posioning
among children in one of the 27 states of india all
because of unhygenic food supplied.I am not aware of
the condition in other states.The govt. schools in
many areas have thatched roofs and some are even very
near collapsing.Some schools occupy just 1/10th of an
acre of land and some even less.
The quality of education is also pretty poor.Most
schools only teach in the local lingo and finding
english speaking people in many  regions are hard.Many
of the students emerging from govt. schools eventually
joins the labour class.
In india the average number of students that pass
tenth grade is only 50 percent of the students
appearing 10th grade.
As for politics,2 of the states in india are ruled by
the communist party of india.The case of labour class
is slighly better here but now a days corruption is at
the peak,that the ruling party and opposition party joins hands to fill up their pockets.
More over elections in india are won over simple
majority and there are over one thousand registered
parties in india.The oppoition against the ruling part
is usually high.
Rich people constitute around 3 to 5 percent of the
Rich people tend to grow very rich because India is
one country you can be 70 to 80 percent sure that any
person you approach will accept a bribe be it sales
tax,income tax or any kind of tax.
Tax evasion is very common among the rich.If you would
like to reduce your electricity bill for industries
just bribe them and they will reverse the electricity
meter for you.
If a few barrels of illicit liquor gets caught,you can
bribe them to replace it with water.You can get away
with a lot of things and make a lot of money-if you
are rich.
Atleast there is'nt much stigma in viewing the
poor.they are more or les treated as equal and well
respected.Others aren't really bothered of poor ppl.
These are just a few basic issues.the conditions in US
are much better than here.
One part is better in india-privacy rights and liberty
are much better compared to US and even if you do
small crimes you can get away with it.
I can spit on the road,i can stand on the road and
block the traffic till i just get shoved off the road
side.There is no way I get arrested.I can do a lot of
things and not get arrested.
If u get arrested-for minor crimes,you can bribe the
cop and you are freed.I never have a swat team that
breaks down my doors.The streets are guns and snipers
free.I have no surveillence cameras watching me.

That sounds very logical.
I retaliated saying that the previlages,power will

It would take us to share a common seed value (a

1.Bank A uses a pseudo random number generator like
Tauss88 with a period of nearly 2^80 or MT19937 with a
period of 2^19937-1 and generates the first IV using
the generator.
2.This IV,is used for chaining but the IV itself is
not transmitted along with the cipher text to the bank
of B.
3.Once the chained cipher text reaches bank of B, they
use the common seed to generate the first IV and this
IV can be used to obtain the actual cipher text.
4.Continue steps 1 to 4 till the period of the
generator.If we use Taus88 we can get nearly 2^80 IV's
and if we use MT19937 we can get upto 2^19937-1 IV's.
We also dont need to hash the IV's itself though they
form a linear recurring sequence, since they are not
transmitted from Bank A to Bank B and we derive no
information of the IV from any number of blocks of the
chained cipher text.
In this way the attacker can no longer perform block
replay attacks.
The funny part is that I have seen some cryptographic
utilities simply appened the IV to the chained cipher
text and transmit to a receiver.

I was reading the following paper Complexity, Vol. 7, No. 5, May/June 2002, pp. 14-21
PARADOXES OF RANDOMNESS
Gregory Chaitin
Under the sub heading- Program-Size Complexity,it says
"Okay, so what does it mean then for a number to be
interesting or uninteresting, now that I'm giving you
a better idea of what I'm talking about. Well,
interesting means it stands out some way from the
herd, and uninteresting means it can't be
distinguished really, it's sort of an average, typical
number, one that isn't worth a second glance. So how
do you define that mathematically using this notion of
the size of computer programs? Well, it's very simple:
a number is uninteresting or algorithmically random or
irreducible or incompressible if there's no way to
name it that's more concise than just writing out the
number directly. That's the idea. In other words, if the most concise computer program
for calculating a number just says to print 123796402,
in that case, if that's the best you can do, then that
number is uninteresting. And that's typically what
happens. On the other hand, if there is a small,
concise computer program that calculates the number,
that's atypical, that means that it has some quality
or characteristic that enables you to pick it out and
to compress it into a smaller algorithmic description.
So that's unusual, that's an interesting number. "
How ever if i take the set of positive whole
numbers(zero included),i.e S={0,1,2,...} ,I can
compress every positive whole number using a computer
program which says
f(x)=2x for all x=0,1,2,... ;
f(x)=2x+1 for all x=0,1,2,...;
and  i simply put it an infinite loop shown in the
following pseudo code
int x=0;
generate f(x)=2x;
generate f(x)=2x+1;
In this way we can compress all the positive whole
numbers because
say i have a number 10. I try to find if it is
interesting or not.
decimal 10 = 1010 in binary
it takes 4 bits to store decimal number 10
I can write a computer program to generate decimal 10
=10    for x=5;
Decimal number 5 can be represented in binary as 101.
So we have 3 bits to represent 5.
Using these 3 bits of information,i can get the
decimal number 10,when i use f(x)=2x;
Similarly-any positive whole number can  be compressed
using the above pseudo code.
This is because
Any whole number multiplied by 2 will give an extra
I have f(x)=2x
I choose x=2, 10 in binary(2 bits).
2*2=4 , 100 in binary(3 bits).
There is an extra bit that gets added ,when we
multiply by 2. I am sure that this is very obvious
So this way I can compress any positive whole number
and thus I can show all the whole numbers are
interesting contradicting the claim in the paper that
most of the whole numbers are uninteresting numbers. He uses this concept of uninteresting numbers to
demonstrate algorithmic randomness.
The paper further says-
"Once you set up this theory properly, it turns out
that most numbers, the great majority of positive
integers, are uninteresting. You can prove that as a
theorem. It's not a hard theorem, it's a counting
argument. There can't be a lot of interesting numbers,
because there aren't enough concise programs. You
know, there are a lot of positive integers, and if you
look at programs with the same size in bits, there are
only about as many programs of the same size as there
are integers, and if the programs have to be smaller,
then there just aren't enough of them to name all of
those different positive integers."
But we already have developed a small concise,as in
the pseudo code shown above,that generates me any
number of whole numbers. This contradicts the above
Further down,under the sub heading Redundant,he says-
"Is this K bits of mathematical information? K
instances of the halting problem will give us K bits
of Turing's number. Are these K bits independent
pieces of information? Well, the answer is no, they
never are. Why not? Because you don't really need to
know K yes/no answers, it's not really K full bits of
information. There's a lot less information. It can be
compressed. Why? "
All logs are base 2.
"And this is going to be a number between zero and K,
a number that's between zero and K. 0 # # that halt # K
And if you write this number in binary it's really
only about log K bits. # that halt = log K bits
Now how can there be redundancy in various instances
of a halting problem.
Say-i have a sack with 64 programmes of which ,i know
that 32 of them will halt and 32 of them will not
halt.I pick,without any order, 32 programs from my
sack to check whether they halt or not.
If the input programmes are picked truely
randomly,then I know 16 of the programs will halt(i.e
50% of the programs halt).
So where is the redundancy in different instances of
the halting problem? I don't see any redundancy.
If the input programs are picked independently,i.e
without any mathametcial structure,the output is by no
means reduntant.
In the section-Redundant,he obtains a real number
called k,which he transforms to k bits of information.
Then he says that there is redundancy in the output
and says that there is only log k(base 2) bits of
information. Here he treats k as a real number and
says that-he only needs log k(base 2) bits to
represent the whole number k. But that is the minimum
number of bits that is required to hold the real
number in binary representation in its information
theorotical sense. What does it have to do with
algorithmic randomness?
it comes to such a question-
I do a fair coin throwing experiment with 64 coins.
To represent 64 coins,i need 5  bits of information.
If the experiment is truely random,i will get 32 of
them as heads and 32 of them as tails-though I dont
know which all are heads and which all are tails.
now-I see which all are heads.While counting,when I
get 32 heads,I can stop counting,since i know the
remaining 32 coins are tails.
To represent 32 coins-i need 5 bits of information.
Since the experiment is truely random-i know half of
them will be heads,so in this case using 5 bits of
information,i can determine all the coins that are
heads and that are tails.
So-the question is what is the minimum number of bits
or entropy required to determine which all coins are
heads and which all coins are tails,is it 5 bits or 6
bits of information?
What chaitin does in his k instance halting problem
-is he compresses the 6 bits to 5 bits,if we draw an
equivalent with our coin tossing experiment,which we
can,as it is equivalent to the coin tossing problem.
 It appears that it is on these lines he obtains the
omega notation,though the exact details are not given
in this paper.
This is what I think.I would like to know more.

generate f(x)=2x+1;
In this way we can compress all the positive whole
numbers because
say i have a number 10. I try to find if it is
interesting or not.
decimal 10 = 1010 in binary
it takes 4 bits to store decimal number 10
I can write a computer program to generate decimal 10
=10    for x=5;
Decimal number 5 can be represented in binary as 101.
So we have 3 bits to represent 5.
Using these 3 bits of information,i can get the
decimal number 10,when i use f(x)=2x;
Similarly-any positive whole number can  be compressed
using the above pseudo code.
This is because
Any whole number multiplied by 2 will give an extra
I have f(x)=2x
I choose x=2, 10 in binary(2 bits).
2*2=4 , 100 in binary(3 bits).
There is an extra bit that gets added ,when we
multiply by 2. I am sure that this is very obvious
So this way I can compress any positive whole number
and thus I can show all the whole numbers are
interesting contradicting the claim in the paper that
most of the whole numbers are uninteresting numbers. He uses this concept of uninteresting numbers to
demonstrate algorithmic randomness.
The paper further says-
"Once you set up this theory properly, it turns out
that most numbers, the great majority of positive
integers, are uninteresting. You can prove that as a
theorem. It's not a hard theorem, it's a counting
argument. There can't be a lot of interesting numbers,
because there aren't enough concise programs. You
know, there are a lot of positive integers, and if you
look at programs with the same size in bits, there are
only about as many programs of the same size as there
are integers, and if the programs have to be smaller,
then there just aren't enough of them to name all of
those different positive integers."
But we already have developed a small concise,as in
the pseudo code shown above,that generates me any
number of whole numbers. This contradicts the above
Further down,under the sub heading Redundant,he says-
"Is this K bits of mathematical information? K
instances of the halting problem will give us K bits
of Turing's number. Are these K bits independent
pieces of information? Well, the answer is no, they
never are. Why not? Because you don't really need to
know K yes/no answers, it's not really K full bits of
information. There's a lot less information. It can be
compressed. Why? "
All logs are base 2.
"And this is going to be a number between zero and K,
a number that's between zero and K. 0 # # that halt # K
And if you write this number in binary it's really
only about log K bits. # that halt = log K bits
Now how can there be redundancy in various instances
of a halting problem.
Say-i have a sack with 64 programmes of which ,i know
that 32 of them will halt and 32 of them will not
halt.I pick,without any order, 32 programs from my
sack to check whether they halt or not.
If the input programmes are picked truely
randomly,then I know 16 of the programs will halt(i.e
50% of the programs halt).
So where is the redundancy in different instances of
the halting problem? I don't see any redundancy.
If the input programs are picked independently,i.e
without any mathametcial structure,the output is by no
means reduntant.
In the section-Redundant,he obtains a real number
called k,which he transforms to k bits of information.
Then he says that there is redundancy in the output
and says that there is only log k(base 2) bits of
information. Here he treats k as a real number and
says that-he only needs log k(base 2) bits to
represent the whole number k. But that is the minimum
number of bits that is required to hold the real
number in binary representation in its information
theorotical sense. What does it have to do with
algorithmic randomness?
it comes to such a question-
I do a fair coin throwing experiment with 64 coins.
To represent 64 coins,i need 5  bits of information.
If the experiment is truely random,i will get 32 of
them as heads and 32 of them as tails-though I dont
know which all are heads and which all are tails.
now-I see which all are heads.While counting,when I
get 32 heads,I can stop counting,since i know the
remaining 32 coins are tails.
To represent 32 coins-i need 5 bits of information.
Since the experiment is truely random-i know half of
them will be heads,so in this case using 5 bits of
information,i can determine all the coins that are
heads and that are tails.
So-the question is what is the minimum number of bits
or entropy required to determine which all coins are
heads and which all coins are tails,is it 5 bits or 6
bits of information?
What chaitin does in his k instance halting problem
-is he compresses the 6 bits to 5 bits,if we draw an
equivalent with our coin tossing experiment,which we
can,as it is equivalent to the coin tossing problem.
 It appears that it is on these lines he obtains the
omega notation,though the exact details are not given
in this paper.
This is what I think.I would like to know more.

Thank you-one more question.
Will the information obtained from the 2^32 tests have
a zero compression rate? If one of the occurance should yield all heads and one
occurance yields all tails-there appears to be scope
for compression.
If the output is random,then it will have no
mathametical structure,so I shouldn't be able to
compress it at all.

thank you for the reply.
If we are to convert a k-bit integer n to a base b
number,it takes us O(log n) if the base b is a power
of 2 is still a correct statement.
Say if we are to multiply a k-bit integer n with the
same k-bit integer n,  i.e multiplying integer n with k-bits by itself.
The multiplication takes atmost k^2 bit operations.
n=5=101 base 2.
i.e the multiplication takes atmost 3^2=9 bit
Thus multiplication of O(k^2) for a constant c and
All logarithms are to the base 2.
Since k=[log n]+1
k^2=([log n]+1)^2
in our example
= ([log 5]+1)^2
=3^3=9 operations.
it is correct to write O(log n)=O(k), as n or k are
the inputs to an algorithm whose time complexity is to
be determined. O(log n)=O(k)is the time the algorithm
takes for processing the input which are essenctially
the same.
yes,I was asking if there is an algorithm in O(k)=O(log n) to convert a k-bit integer n to
arbitrary base. I only know to do it in O(k^2).

In Diffie Hellman key exchange we choose a large prime
in Fp. The prime is publicly known,so is g,preferably
a generator in Fp*.
The reason that you might need to change the prime
frequently is only if you donot choose g(element of)Fp
to be a generator in Fp or the prime field be too
If the attacker knows the prime factorization of p-1,
where p-1=q_1*q_2*...*q_n,he can compute which of
 g^((p-1)/q_i)== 1 mod p and determine the order of g.
If it has a lower order, the attack is easier.
If you choose g of maximum order in Fp, then you will
have maximum security.
The diffie-hellman key exchange works under the
assumption that knowing only g^a and g^b, it is
computationaly infeasible for the attacker to
calculate g^(ab) and breaking it is conjenctured to be
as hard as the discrete log problem.

The C code for the blowfish encryption algorithm
posted in Mr.Schneier's site, acocording to Michael.B
still 'chokes' as it is not corrected even though the
bug report, mentions that it is a fatal bug.
The bug report is available at
 His opinion is that the code  still 'chokes' in
 Though Mr.Mike Morgan in the bug report attrbutes the
bug to "non-standard use of the 'union' construct", I
think it is automatic type cast form type signed char
to unsigned long,is responsible for this bug. Please see his comments below.
Sarad A.V
Forwarded on request by Michael.B
Also the bug IS a very serious security issue if you
read into the bug doc, making Blowfish a very easy
crackable cipher... and yes you are right every
responsible programmer should use test vectors etc., I
do, but how do I know someone else did if I can't
review the code and have no other means of testing,
for example with (proper - see below) test vectors? And... (you really did not read into the bug-doc)...
standard test vectors DO NOT SHOW the bug. Which is
why it is such an evil one, aside the extreme security
loss. 150 products use Blowfish so far, as counterpane.org
states, and many of them don't have a verification
scheme at all. I recall a Secure Shell for example,
implementing Blowfish as an optional cipher to choose
from among others. Now with that (commercial) product
I would choose Blowfish never more since I can't
review the code or test with selected test vectors.
And this is the point. The bug thing coming directly
from Schneier does create a general distrust in
Blowfish for me.
now this is an ORIGINAL quote from the bug-describing
doc taking direct from schneier's website. next, please consider this ORIGINAL paste of the
ref-installation by schneier short InitializeBlowfish(char key[], short keybytes) {    unsigned long  data;   ... //lots of code ommitted       j = 0;       for (i = 0; i < N + 2; ++i) {         data = 0x00000000;         for (k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {           data = (data << 8) | key[j]; //(my comment)

They had been researching on this line in Indian

searching has fundamental limits. For  successfully matching two images, there should be a subset of
information in both that totally match or match with a
high probability.
Expecting a front view of an image to match with a
side view of the same image is impossible. They are
both disjoint sets of information.
If all the images are frontal images, we can match
them with a hight probability, otherwise I doubt this
technology has a future.

Yes, there should be a lot of noise in the image, some

How hard is it to 'hack' cable? How hard is it to find an alternative? They seem to be focusing on a very narrow threat scenario and finding a solution to it.

AbstractbOur study analyzes the security and privacy properties
of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Introduced
to the U.S. market in 2003, this model of ICD includes
pacemaker technology and is designed to communicate wirelessly
with a nearby external programmer in the 175 kHz frequency
range. After partially reverse-engineering the ICDbs communications
protocol with an oscilloscope and a software radio, we
implemented several software radio-based attacks that could
compromise patient safety and patient privacy. Motivated by
our desire to improve patient safety, and mindful of conventional
trade-offs between security and power consumption for resourceconstrained
devices, we introduce three new zero-power defenses
based on RF power harvesting. Two of these defenses are humancentric,
bringing patients into the loop with respect to the security
and privacy of their implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our
contributions provide a scientific baseline for understanding the
potential security and privacy risks of current and future IMDs,
and introduce human-perceptible and zero-power mitigation
techniques that address those risks. To the best of our knowledge,
this paper is the first in our community to use general-purpose
software radios to analyze and attack previously unknown radio
communications protocols.

I was going through the wikipedia example of shamir secret sharing which says it is information theoretically secure.
In the example in that url, they have a polynomial
f(x) = 1234 + 166.x + 94.x^2
they construct 6 points from the polynomial
the secret here is S=1234. The threshold k=3 and the number of participants n=6.
If say, first two users collude then
1494 = S + c1 .1 + c2.1
1942 = S + c1 .2 + c2.2
clearly, one can start making inferences about the sizes of the unknown co-efficients c1 and c2 and S.
However, it is said in the URL above that Shamir secret is information theoretically secure
in the url below they say
"Secret sharing schemes such as Shamir's are information theoretically secure (and in fact perfectly secure) in that less than the requisite number of shares of the secret provide no information about the secret."
how can that be true? we already are able to make inferences.
Moreover say that, we have 3 planes intersecting at a single point in euclidean space, where each plane is a secret share(Blakely's scheme). With 2 plane equations, we cannot find the point of intersection but we can certainly narrow down to the line where the planes intersect. There is information loss about the secret.
from this it appears that Shamir's secret sharing scheme leaks information from its shares but why is it then considered information theoretically secure?
They do appear to leak information as similar to k-threshold schemes using chinese remainder theorem.
what am i missing?

@_subject: TOR encryption 
I was looking at TOR's wikipedia entry
"Eavesdropping by exit nodes
In September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed that by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes he had intercepted usernames and passwords for a large number of email accounts.[15] As Tor does not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture any traffic passing through it which does not use end-to-end encryption, e.g. SSL. While this does not inherently violate the anonymity of the source, it affords added opportunities for data interception by self-selected third parties, greatly increasing the risk of exposure of sensitive data by users who are careless or who mistake Tor's anonymity for security.[16]"
Since a lot of people may be interested in running rouge exit nodes, why not have an optional setup where we can get rid of encrypting the traffic(i mean user data) and provide anonymity alone? It is best to take security out of the hands of the end user but in case the end user knows what he is doing and can run end to end secure services, wouldn't getting rid of this encryption(an optional provision) significantly speed up TOR?

@_subject: Mark as unread - gmail and yahoo 
it has been some time since both gmail and yahoo has introduced this (Mark as unread) feature in their webmail access. if your mail account has been compromised (someone else figures your password), then the attacker can at will read your unread mail and then mark it as unread. When the 'mark as read' option was not available, a successful attacker would have to delete the unread email to do avoid detection, but then the sender will at some point of time inform the recipient about the mail that he never received.
In both cases, the attacker can still read all the mails already read by the recipient but if the recipient has the habit of deleting(including trash) immediately after reading the mail, it helps the attacker to have a mark as unread option. As soon as the mail arrives, the attacker reads it and marks it as unread. Then the recipient gets to read it and he will immediately delete it.
as far as mail clients such as Outlook goes, I think if it is deleted from webmail, it will not appear in your Outlook mail client (not sure, someone can confirm this). It may be better for security if there is no unread option.
Moreover, Gmail allows you to see the last login ip to your email and the current session ip's but that won't help if the attacker is from the same organization (with a lot of computers connecting through the same public ip) that you use to access your email.

I have a basic doubt of the birthday problem  for the case k=2, i.e 2 lists, where it is required to find a xor b =0(implies a=b; such that a is from the first list and b is from the second list).
Now, if we operate on 'n' bit values, then the basic algorithm is said to work in O( 2^(n/2) ) time and space. That is the time  and space requirement to find a collision between the two list.
What we do is fill the two lists(each) with  2^(n/2) random integers and 'JOIN' them. JOIN gives the elements that are common to both the lists.
JOIN (done efficiently) basically means sorting the two lists individually and then looking for a match between the two lists. We are assuming that we will have practical memory constrains when 'n' is large.
Sorting x elements can be done in O(x.log x) <--(1)
For e.g. if k=2 and x=256 elements; sorting takes O(x.log x) . But we store only 2^(n/2) elements in each list. Hence n=8 bits.
SO, we have 2^4 = 16 elements in each list. By eq (1), sorting takes
O(2^4 * 4) time= O(2^6) time.
Since x=256 , n=8 and we should have got O( 2^(n/2) ); i.e. O( 2^(8/2) ) =  O( 2^4 )  time complexity
there is a mismatch between the time complexities. what am I doing wrong here?

BankofA has its legitimate certificate issued by (say for example Verisign).
Now, say that is possible to carry out a MITM attack at the end user (bank's

When the end user opens BankofA.com on the browser, with the MITM in place -
the fake certificate issued by CA X will be presented to the end user. The end

The first visit scenario is definitely an issue. that brings it to the other question - why cannot CA's issue certificates to sites say like 10 years or 20 years and get the corresponding money for that. Most certificates issued by CA's usually have 2-3 years validity. Incase of a significant mathematical breakthrough the CA should provide an alternate secure certifying mechanism if the breakthrough occurred within the service period (10/20 years). The question is why do popular https sites not go for certificates that expire in 10/20 years if it helps security?
Another question, this one is specific to gmail - which the entire session is on https.
when i click a pdf in my gmail to be opened with google docs, the certificate is signed by google(used a third part browser plugin to check this). that is fine, however my browser never alerts me as a potential untrusted certificate and if want to add it as an exception. does that mean google is an intermediate CA or what does that mean?

what happens if you say that you are not good at drawing and end up drawing
wire-frames of the descriptions asked. it may also be true that the person is
no good at drawing.
you can say 'speak' and with a good probability the person can speak. the same
doesn't hold true when you say 'draw'. people who are bad at drawing doesn't
have much clue as to put visualizations on 2D. I definitely suspect that they
will get distances, angles or ratio's right when they attempt to put it on

Is this really necessary and a better idea. Will it really improve security or is my skepticism misplaced? Sarad. IDG News Service - India plans to develop a new computer operating system, with an eye to enhancing the security of its computer systems, a government spokesman said on Monday.
The new operating system is being developed by the country's Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO), Ravi Kumar Gupta, a spokesman for the DRDO, said.

Came across this interview of an ATM machine in Antartica
Here is a snippet of the Q&A session from the interview:
DP: You know, that is a very good question, and you're right it is
challenging--certainly makes for a long commute for our servicers. I'm kidding
thereb&tongue-in-cheekb& No, actually, what we do--first of all, the cash on
the ice is recycled. So McMurdo Station (which is the scientists' station
there on Antarctica)... any sort of venue, the cash is all recycled, and so
there's no cash vendor that has to go down all the time to a regular ATM to
replenish the cash volume.
W: Rightb&there's only so many places one can run with cash down there, I
That brings us to the obvious question, why not use something like a debit
card hooked to a central network? Why does hard currency have to flow? Will
not the time and effort be far lesser, in case of the former?

"The L4.verified project
  A Formally Correct Operating System Kernel
L4.verified The University of New South Wales
Function calls in the seL4 kernel [What's this?]
In current software practice it is widely accepted that software will always have problems and that we will just have to live with the fact that it may crash at the worst possible moment: You might be on a deadline. Or, much scarier, you might be on a plane and there's a problem with the board computer.
Now think what we constantly want from software: more features, better performance, cheaper prices. And we want it everywhere: in mobile phones, cars, planes, critical infrastructure, defense systems.
What do we get? Mobile phones that can be hacked by SMS. Cars that have more software problems than mechanical ones. Planes where computer problems have lead to serious incidents. Computer viruses spreading through critical infrastructure control systems and defense systems. And we think "See, it happens to everybody." "

Now, can all these above mentioned problems disappear with seL4 microkernel?

This may be of interest
Reliably erasing data from storage media (sanitizing the media) is a critical
component of secure data management. While sanitizing entire disks and
individual files is well-understood for hard drives, flash-based solid state
disks have a very different internal architecture, so it is unclear whether
hard drive techniques will work for SSDs as well. We empirically evaluate the
effectiveness of hard drive-oriented techniques and of the SSDsb built-in
sanitization commands by extracting raw data from the SSDbs flash chips
after applying these techniques and commands.
Our results lead to three conclusions:
First, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers sometimes implement
them incorrectly.
Second, overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD twice is
usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the drive. Third, none of the
existing hard drive-oriented techniques for individual file sanitization are
effective on SSDs.
This third conclusion leads us to develop flash translation layer extensions
that exploit the details of flash memorybs behavior to efficiently support
file sanitization. Overall, we find that reliable SSD sanitization requires
built-in, verifiable sanitize operations.

Yes, true. Also have to check the scenario as to how the card details are first entered into the phone and a malicious code already running at that time.

The assumption is that the user is unaware of the virus. Google wallet is either available/coming up as an Android application. It is reasonable to assume that a lot of phones running Android connect to the internet due to the way gmail,google chat,googlemaps and youtube is integrated into it. Personally, I am going to wait and watch its security for a while. There may be an issue of how this affects personal security. The user is now 'forced' to carry his wallet just by carrying his/her smartphone.

Is there anything that stops the card number and PIN from being stolen and transmitted to a malicious remote user when the a smartphone using google wallet has a virus on it and is connected to the internet?
Thank you,
