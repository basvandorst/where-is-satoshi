There are other issues than not being familiar with technology, and they specifically affect those of us who have grown older, and lost certain dexterity that used to be innate. There are passwords and pass phrases I used to have committed to muscle memory. I never even had to think about them. I've had to spend literally hours trying to type in a PGP pass phrase that used to be something I could type without thinking.
There is no one size fits all solution to this. I'm still very annoyed with a company that has only now moved to a password solution that should have been in place in 2005. I still don't want single sign on. Not anywhere. I've been around for a very long time, and I'm fine with technical complexity for me, but do not expect the standard 16 year old text messaging addict to be able to handle some of the solutions I've seen suggested, much less most people my age.
Things are so complex now that people on nanog-l forget the average level of expertise among their peer groups is simply not replicated in the outside world. Jokes about needing a teenager to reprogram your VCR are a thing of the past. I used to be in the business of forecasting the future (among other things), and any security solution that is more difficult than knowing not to use the same password for your bank that you do for Facebook is doomed to fail.

Sorry to be the bearer of such bad tidings. Please note that I'm doing a quick copy/paste from a notification I received. I've edited it a bit.
Please note that LinkedIn has weighed in with a carefully worded blog post:
Further details:
1. The leak took place on June 4
2. LinkedIn was using unsalted SHA-1 for their password store.
3. FYI, there are two lists. The second one appears to be from eHarmony. Unsalted MD5 used there.
4. The posted passwords are believed to be ones the cracker wanted help with, i.e., they have significantly more already cracked.
Apparently phishing emails are already active in the wild based on the In other words, if you have a LinkedIn account, expect that the password has been stolen. Go change your password now. If you used that password elsewhere, you know the routine. In addition, as has been pointed out elsewhere, there's no sign LI has fixed the problem. Expect that the password you change it to will also be compromised.

Fascinating dialogue, so far, but I have to point out that Amex became
a bank in 2008.
Mind you, traveler's checks issued by them are not the same thing as
the bank checks that the conversation was about, but Amex is indeed
a bank.
