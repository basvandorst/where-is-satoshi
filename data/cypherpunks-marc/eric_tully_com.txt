Apparently the Yahoo (Reuters) story got it wrong. According to two other articles I read, he logged into the AOL account that was configured on the machine that he stole, not his *own* account. No "phone home" software, no MAC addresses, and no serial numbers in the CPU were used to find the machine.
Of course, the more important question: If the computer had such sensitive data on it, why would it ever be granted network access?
Investigators knew where to look for the gear not because of unusually intrepid sleuthing but because Krastof allegedly used the computer to log on to an AOL account belonging to the system's owner, Peter Gascoyne.
This allowed authorities to eventually trace the call back to Krastof's residence, said the Police Department's White, who acknowledged that cracking the case was, as much as anything, a matter of pure luck.
Jun at Cryptography Research said most people don't realize that they announce their presence and leave an electronic trail any time they go "Using a stolen computer to log onto the Net is like taking a stolen credit card (and) buying gas for all your friends at a single service station, " he said. "It's pretty easy to get caught."
White said investigators had asked AOL as a routine precaution to watch for any log-ons in Gascoyne's name. He said the world's biggest online service had reported a hit earlier this month but then dragged its feet in providing information about the phone line used in the connection.
White said telecom giant SBC, in turn, had not been very helpful in offering information about the location of the residence where the AOL dial-up originated. SBC and AOL privacy policies both say information can be shared with law-enforcement officials.
"We ended up taking a while with search warrants," White said. "Part of the difficulty was the lack of cooperation among various entities."
AOL did not return calls seeking comment. An SBC spokesman said company officials had fulfilled investigators' requests the same day they were Once all the pieces were in place, though, White said, authorities arrived at Krastof's home around 7 p.m. Tuesday and were let in by his - Eric Tully

I've heard that argument before (last time I heard it was a problem with a PGP implementation) and I never understand what people are trying to prove when they say it.
Are you saying that the Open Source model isn't as good as proprietary "we'll-fix-it-if-we-feel-like-it" models? Are you saying that Open Source isn't the promised land like you were... um, promised? Are you saying that Open Source model shouldn't be used for anything that concerns security? I honestly don't know what you're getting at.
So Open Source is not a perfect solution. In its defense:
- you had the opportunity to hire a team of 50 to examine the code
- the solution was made known to you
- you can reject this solution and write your own if you prefer
none of which would have been true if this were proprietary code.
There's so many good things about this model - it seems silly to argue that Open Souce doesn't live up to the unrealistic hype that the guys on Slashdot promised you.

Ahh... but if that were true, why would the US ever admit it?  Let's say they run a DNA test and it's not him... why not just say, "We ran a DNA test and it's him!!"   That would be a bigger boost for Bush for the coming election.
There's still 13 more in the deck of cards - as well as Bin Laden - to use as an excuse to maintain their war on terrorism.

From The Register:
"To download the online picture, he used the anonymising Surfola service (and not Anonymiser.com as we mistakenly wrote in our initial report - apologies to all concerned - Ed), believing the companys privacy policy would protect him."
So now I don't know what to believe.  Either Anonymizer was never involved... or they don't want it known that they sold out so they asked for a retraction.
