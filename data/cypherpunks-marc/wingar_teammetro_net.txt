@_subject: Re: William was raided for running a Tor exit node. Please help if you can. 
I gotta ask and I'm sure someone would if I didn't, but how do we know
this guy is legit?
He's jumped up on a forum saying, "Hey, police raided me, help. gib
mone plz" and failed to provide and reason as to how he's real and not
just making it up.
Maybe if there's a way to know this guy is legit, I'll help out if
possible, but until then I'm just going to watch others with caution
and I suggest others do as well.
