Hi Jake,
Ian Grigg just made a point on metzdowd that I think is true: if you
want to change the NSA, you need to address the many corporates that
profit from what they are doing. Because the chain goes like this:
corporate money -> election campaigns -> representatives -> NSA
What do you think? And any ideas how to exercise pressure?
