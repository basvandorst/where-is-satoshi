Hi Paul.
You are welcome! ;-)
I love it when users try to show off with what internet dinosaurs their are, as soon as someone tries to teach them how to do something better..
Well, I am an Internet Dinosaur, too, with quite a comparable track record as you, so I am not all to impressed ;-)
Well, as it seems, most readers here *may know* how it should be done, but yet *don't do* it correctly, since it has shown that most users do just read all incoming mail unsorted and not threaded.
While anybody has the right to do so - no one has the right to complain afterwards about drowning in mail that does not concern him. But awkwardly enough many users did complain. And I will not accept them blaming me for not using their mail readers correctly.
Every user will consider different things to be noise. I do not consider this thread to be noise - at all. You do. Just read another thread that appeals you more?
It would have been a wise sentence, if it would have stopped here ;-)
FACK! The only difference is, that you consider me to be the troll (maybe because I backtalk without hesitation to those who try to muzzle and censor me?) - while I consider those to be the trolls, who do not contribute anything of value to the discussion but plainly interfere in this thread and bully the others to stop discussing about the topic, because they claim that it bores them - instead of just walking away.
Thanks so much ;-)
As far as Netiquette is concerned, I am surprised how many of those "computer geeks" that participate at this mailing list are clueless about Netiquette, and the basic usage of mail readers, etc.
Take for an example how many postings are not quoting correctly, but have "text on top - full quote below" which is a no-go in newsgroups and mailing lists...

Hello Chris,
Thank you for your unemotional, factual statement!
I see. Well, it was pending moderator approval for an hour or so and =
then suddenly appeared to me as being removed. Maybe it was just because =
of some browser issue over here, i don't know. Today I see the posting =
being published and also your answer to it. Thank you for that!
Thank you for this unambiguous, precise answer.
That is the kind of answer, that I was hoping for.
Thank you for this additional, very valuable information, too.
Well, sometimes you get the most interesting information out of simple, =
straightforward questions. By my comprehension this whole thread is a =
vivid proof for that.
And given that you where bound to a nondisclosure-dictate by your =
government; you would have only three choices:
a) "We don't want to say"
b)  or awkward answer
c) Lying
a) and b) are a clear "yes" and given that not everybody is comfortable =
lying, chances exist that you might feel it.
Well, there is some evidence to suggest that Linus/Linux has been =
Well yes, the publication of the source code allows others to review it, =
and given that the code is being maintained in a public revision control =
repository increases chances, that malicious changes are identified =
quickly. These are advantages that cloused source projects do not have a =
priori, I agree.
But in practice open source projects are no universal remedy to =
malicious influences. Take for example the transition from the publicly =
revised source code to the binary versions. Chances are extremely high =
that no one will ever notice any last-minute changes to the local source =
code, such as adding some surveillance "features", prior compiling the =
binaries out of it and releasing them to the public, or am I mistaking?
So at the end everything stands or falls with the trust that you have in =
a project, i.e. the key people of the project. So what was more obvious =
than just asking them directly and see what they have to say about that =
So, since we cleared that out, please allow me to ask some continuative =
Has the project pfSense (i.e. it's leaders) ever thought about what =
it/they would do if the day should come where those NSA-people (or =
others) knock the door and demand infiltration, as they did e.g. with =
Lavabit? Is there some way that the project and it's leaders can protect =
themselves of getting into such a catch-22 situation? Could a project =
such as pfSense be immunized against such inquires, e.g. by technical =
measures concerning the code base, the download repositories, etc.? Or =
do you think that currently everything is perfectly arranged already so =
that no further action is needed, etc.?

Hi Pim,
first of all: Generally - sorry for disturbing you.
But: Interpreting your message, I guess you are participating at this mailing list with a mail reader that just pours all incoming mail into one folder - which is not "the proper way" to read mailing lists.
Please let me inform you that it is highly advisable to participate at mailing lists only with a mail reader that allows you to view incoming mail in "threaded mode". This way you only get to read messages that interest you, instead of being flooded by all messages of all users with all subjects.
Not using such a threaded-capable reader but telling others what to write and what not because you are bored about what they discuss is not really a solution :-)
A reader that is capable of threaded view mode is e.g. Mozilla Thunderbird (View > Sort by > Threaded)

Hi Walter,
Interesting what all kinds of different things you do interpret into my By my comprehension I just asked simple but important question and did this quite straight-forwardly.
Yes. Censorship always raises questions.
Well, your example neglects one important aspect: pfSense is a kind of security software project. Asking it about it's level of security and integrity is a question that such a project must stand, IMHO. It is like asking a bank how safe my money is. Or asking Microsoft how good "Word" is for writing letters; while asking me about if I plan to overthrow some government or kill other people refers to nothing.
I guess for anybody related to computer security it is a must to question anything anytime and take nothing for granted. You should question everything any time and any player in this domain should accept any questions any time, IMHO.
What trouble do you refer to? I only read some aggressive/ snappy answers which - frankly - I find pretty awkward reactions to my simple Thinker Rix

Exactly. But sometimes you can get the most interesting results out of "silly straight forward" questions. E.g. by carefully analyzing the reactions, or the words that are said - or not said.
Additionally as far as I have figured, the criminal authorities even forbid those companies to talk about things. So the most common official answer is: "We are not allowed to talk about it" (=Yes, we are held hostages by the criminal authorities).
If this should be the case, we - the community - could find a solution all together, e.g. by re-incorporating the project in a free country (= not the USA!).
Well, yes. But who does? Do you? Me not. Who does then?
I *hope* that, too. But do I *know*? No.

Exactly, Paul, you got my point!
 doubts about the NSA/FBI/ bothering with smaller companies such as Electric Sheep Fencing LLC (formerly BSD perimeter) and their niche product pfSense:
Please take these 2 things into account:
1. Recently they forced the small encrypted-email-service "Lavabit" to comply with them (hand out their SSL-masterkeys & install a "black-box" at their premises). Lavabit did not agree - and they shut him down.  Officially they wanted to force Lavabit to just hand out Edward Snowden's emails (bad enough), but in reality they wanted to gain access to all emails of Lavabit by receiving the SSL masterkeys and by placing the blackbox at their premises, which rendered the whole service useless.
2. Routers/Gateways/Firewalls are highly interesting for big brother. Read e.g. this article "NSA Laughs at PCs, Prefers Hacking Routers and Switches" So, combining those 2 facts - the fact that the NSA/FBI/etc. prefer to infiltrate routers with the fact that they very well bother knocking the doors of small businesses with niche products, I guess my question is quite legitimate!

The point is not untrusting ESF or anybody else. The point is that ESF is based in the USA, a country where the current government can force you to do things against your community without having any chance to escape from it; they just force you to do so.
So the point of the whole idea that we evaluate here is: How can we secure pfSense from this nasty government so that they can not just force ESF or anybody else to comply with them.
As far as I am informed there are some more countries on the globe than the USA and the UK...
Seems like a killer argument to me, which is kind of couterproductive in such an early stage of an idea/proposition, as this is.

I think that your idea is worth further consideration.
As I just answered to other postings of this thread, by my comprehension infiltrating firewall software such as pfSense should be highly interesting for NSA, etc. because they would get a grip onto your internal and VPN traffic.
So it should be only a matter of time, that they knock the door at ESF and force them to do things they don't like. We all - as a community - should think and act pro-actively to that and take appropriate measures to protect pfSense, ESF and the key people such as Chris Buechler and his partners from this realistic thread in time.

There are many countries which would be a possibility . If wiretapping is done there or not is not so relevant. Relevant is, if the authorities can and do inject backdoors into the project by legal force.
I am not an expert, but in the NSA-thread above there have been examples given, how CVS can be circumvented. Also, the gap between the sources and the binaries could possibly be an port of entry for nasty stuff I guess.
Again: The real threat by my comprehension is not some "guy in the internet" trying to place malicious code into the code base, but simply and plainly some NSA officers knock the door an force the project leaders to do it.
Yes, they do that. And much more, because they do not restrict themselves to a single source. They e.g. get the data from the data providers (google, facebook, amazon, etc.) AND wiretap the internet backbones AND program trojan horses to send them to their peoples (see e.g.  AND collect geolocation data from your mobile phone provider AND force your encrypted-email provider to hand out their SSL keys to them AND ... etc. etc. etc.
But: With all those methods they can only collect EXTERNAL data. With exception the mentioned trojan horse, they do not as easily get your INTERNAL data, e.g. the data that circulates between the computers of your intranet.
By infiltrating a firewall software such as pfSense, they could get a grip onto the most important neuralgic point of the intranet, since much of the internal traffic flows over this box. Think e.g. about all that VPN traffic that flows over the firewall, e.g. because a company connects many branches via VPN...
So: Getting a grip onto the firewall would surely be highly interesting for them...
Yes, but see above.
