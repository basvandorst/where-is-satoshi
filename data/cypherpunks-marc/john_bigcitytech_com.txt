Using InnoDB on a large table (> 100,000,000 rows)...
Trying to get a count that should equal about 25,000,000.
Wasn't using that much memory.
Database crashes....
Any idea?
030605 19:38:27  InnoDB: Assertion failure in thread 45068 in file row0sel.c line 1977
InnoDB: Failing assertion: len == DATA_ROW_ID_LEN
InnoDB: We intentionally generate a memory trap.
InnoDB: Send a detailed bug report to mysql
mysqld got signal 11;
This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help the problem, but since we have already crashed, something is definitely and this may fail.
It is possible that mysqld could use up to
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_connections = 2465391 K
bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.
Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
Cannot determine thread, fp=0xbfe3e7b8, backtrace may not be correct.
Stack range sanity check OK, backtrace follows:
New value of fp=(nil) failed sanity check, terminating stack trace!
Please read  and follow instructions on how to resolve the stack trace. Resolved
stack trace is much more helpful in diagnosing the problem, so please do
resolve it
Trying to get some variables.
Some pointers may be invalid and cause the dump to abort...
thd->query at 0x8773000 = select count(*) from user_new where list_code = 18
Successfully dumped variables, if you ran with --log, take a look at the
details of what thread 3 did to cause the crash.  In some cases of really
bad corruption, the values shown above may be invalid.
The manual page at  contains
information that should help you find out what is causing the crash.
