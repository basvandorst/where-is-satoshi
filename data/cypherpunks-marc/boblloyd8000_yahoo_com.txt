@_subject: [cryptography] Smart card with external pinpad 
Has anyone performed an analysis of the security of any of the available smart card reader/external pin pad solutions?? Are they effective at keeping the pin from being accessible at the host to which the reader is connected?? Does anyone have any concerns about the security of these products?? If you were to test the security of such a solution, any suggestions as to what you'd look for or would be concerned about?
