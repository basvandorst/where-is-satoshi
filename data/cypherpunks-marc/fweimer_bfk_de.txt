* David Wagner:
It's also possible to factor an n-bit number in O(n^k) integer
additions, substractions, multiplications, divisions and comparisons
to zero, for some smallish fixed value of k (an observations which is
due to Schönhage, IIRC).  So you have to look very closely at your
model of computation.  It turns out integer arithmetic isn't the
relevant one.  Until scalable quantum computers are available, it will
be difficult to forecast what the correct model will be.  There might
be practical limits not immediately apparent, similar to our lack of
means to build machine registers which can store integers in the
mathematical sense.

* Peter Gutmann:
Then those code signing certificates cannot be revoked anyway.  The
problem you raised only applies to certificates that can be revoked. 8-)
I think RFC 5280 CAs which do not list expired certificates in CRLs are
simply unsuitable if you try to extend certificate validaty using
timestamp signatures.
