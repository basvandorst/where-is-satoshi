Not exactly this sort of situation, no.  I do know that we've had
hosting customers that have had domains with melbourneit.com as the
registrar that they were unable to ever transfer to another registrar
(despite emails, faxes, and phone calls; IIRC one customer tried for
most of a year to transfer a domain to another registrar or at least get
the nameservers changed without success).

go to die.
