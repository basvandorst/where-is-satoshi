A TV Plea for Patriot Hackers             By Brian McWilliams 2:00 a.m. Sep. 26, 2001 PDT A new TV public service announcement targets U.S. computer hacktivists with
a blunt
message: Uncle Sam wants you to help fight the war on terrorism. But the spot, which organizers hope to begin airing nationwide next week on
major networks,
will warn that misguided patriotic efforts from software experts can hurt
the cause. The first of its kind to address the issue of hacking, the "Hackers Against
spot will attempt to channel U.S. computer security gurus into productive
rather than
destructive action, said Parry Aftab, executive director of Cyberangels, an
Internet safety and help organization that is sponsoring the ads. "The hacker community is very important in the fight against terrorism. But
we want to get the
message out that if they want to get busy doing good stuff, they should come
to us and not
try to take action on their own," said Aftab. A couple points:
1. Is this really the first anti-hacking PSA? I don't think so - I
definitely remember anti
piracy PSAs from the BSA. Have there been others?
2. 'Cyberangels' is (I think) the same group which a few years ago tried to
to be leaders in the fight against online child porn. As desirable as
protecting actual children may be, the group seemed astonishingly ignorant of the
world - one spokesman claiming that *.gif and *.jpg file extensions were

Palme was proof that folks who interefere in other people's business get
burned. He was far from merely a Swedish president. He lost that position
in 1976, regaining it in 1982 (he was murdered in 1986). In the interim, he was an international do-gooder, meddling in the affairs of many countries. The list of possible enemies is long, including Croatian nationalists, Kurds, West German terrorist factions, and South African
secret police (he was killed a week after speaking at an anti-apartheid
rally). There is also a possibility that it was an internal assassination.
Whoever killed him, this was an attack aimed at Palme personally,
not at Swedes in general.  So my point stands - very, very few
people consider the Swedes or Sweden as a 'Great Satan'. The US

@_subject: RE: Manhattan Mid-Afternoon 
I noticed one data point which suggests that the terrorists on Flight 11
from Boston did not have the flying skills of a commercial pilot.
CNN at one point showed the ground track of the flight (it was available
on some website). The flight kept it's normal track (slightly north of
west from Boston) until it crossed over the NY state border. Soon after
that, it took a sharp left turn and headed south for NYC. But not a straight
line - it was clear that they were following the Hudson River.
So, they were using visual navigation. An experienced, instrument rated
pilot could have flown a direct route to NYC, somewhat shortening the time his colleagues would have had to keep the passengers subdued. Further on the skills thing - at one time I toyed with the idea of getting
a private pilots license, and even took a couple lessons. I found that the
experience I had gained using a Flight Simulator program on a PC was
invaluable, particularly for getting the hang straight-and-level flight,
coordinated turns, changing altitudes, etc, which are all the skills that the terrorist would have needed.
This morning the local media here in Massachusetts were reporting that
a bag for the flight which fortuitously failed to get on the plane was found to contain a Koran, "Islamic materials", and a videotape on flying commercial jets. Clearly, someone who was already a commercial pilot would not have needed the latter item.
I sincerely hope that the remaining perpetrators of this atrocity are found and punished, but entertain no illusions that doing so will prevent future attacks. That can only come from a shift of US government attitude from "I've got the biggest stick", to one of non-interference. Sweden and Switzerland come to mind as prosperous, modern, western nations which don't have problems with terrorism. Our country should look to such successful terrorism prevention policies as examples.

What would actually happen is that there would not be an attempt

on the first three was that the usual protocol for hijacks involves
landing, and letting most/all of the passengers off unharmed.
For disarmed passengers, the best option for survival was to anticipate this protocol, and sit tight.
As soon as some of the passengers on plane 4 learned what
a different protocol was in effect, the terrorists were doomed. If a hijack was attempted today, even against disarmed passengers

Tuesday October 2 3:33 AM ET Customs Wants Lists of Passengers
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Airlines should be required to turn over their
advance lists of passengers to screen for possible terrorists, the new
Customs Service commissioner says. Robert Bonner, in an interview with The Associated Press, said
Monday he first wants the passenger information for all international
flights headed for the United States. Then, he said, Congress should
consider requiring that such information be turned over for domestic
flights as well. The Customs Service has access to about 85 percent of international
flight passenger information under a voluntary program with the airlines.
It has no information on domestic flights. ``I believe that it would be extremely valuable if there is a requirement
that the airlines provide that information to Customs, to feed it into our
data base and thereby identify potential terrorists or other suspects who
make an attempt to enter the U.S.,'' Bonner said. On air travel, the agency has received information voluntarily from
airlines since 1988 on international air passengers, including names, birth
dates, nationality and travel document numbers. The information is
collected at the time of departure and transmitted to Customs while
flights are en route to the United States. Ninety-five air carriers and two governments - Australia's and New
Zealand's - transmit data on international soon-to-arrive air passengers
to a Customs facility in Virginia. Air carriers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Pakistan and Egypt are among those that don't participate, Customs
spokesman Dennis Murphy said. To force airlines to give international passenger information to Customs
may require congressional action. ``For a foreign airline that would be unwilling to provide the information,
we should simply deny the right to land in the United States,'' Bonner
suggested. Obtaining information on passengers traveling within the United States
also could be helpful to law enforcement, he said.

suprised if there were Roman or earlier versions as well.
The split-bill technique has old roots.
"By the thirteenth century in England, private dealers,
accountants and businessmen were using a royal financial
system of the twelfth century to commit their business
transactions to a physical medium.  Their motivation was
only to monitor and keep track of the multitude of
transactions with clients in order to protect their
self-interest.  Thirteenth-century English businessmen used
tally sticks to record a proof of payment for goods
purchased or to show the liability of one party to make
payments to another.  Tally sticks were made of hazel wood
and the transactions taking place would be recorded and
reflected by notches carved into the tally with a knife.
The names of the parties involved in the transaction were
recorded with ink beside the notches, usually in Hebrew,
Latin or French. Tallies have also been found to have seals
attached to them, which were most likely used to
authenticate the record.  The size and shape of the notches,
and therefore the terms of the transaction, would be
mutually agreed upon by both parties, at which time the
tally would be split down the middle.  The two halves could
then be brought together, like two pieces of a puzzle, to
attest to the actual occurrence of the transaction and to
protect against forgery (10).  The tally stick is a
bipartite record whereby both parties have a portion of the
record to keep for their own interest and for evidence
should they need to prove an obligation or right.
Medieval chirographs are also characterized by their
bipartite nature.  Chirographs recorded agreements and
transactions of many things including the exchanges of goods
and services for financial consideration.  The terms of the
contract are written out twice (once on either side of the
parchment) and one large title is then written across the
top of the parchment spanning both instances of the
contract.  The parchment was then split down the middle, so
each party could retain a record of the contract.  Like the
tally stick, the two pieces of parchment could be brought
together and if the title at the top of the parchment lined
up correctly, the contract was deemed authentic."
[These tallysticks piled up in government archives, and
were kept long after no one could read them (the dead media
problem isn't new, either). In 1834 it was decided to dispose
of them by burning, but the fire got out of control and burned
down the Palace of Westminster]
More recently, in (I think) Philadelphia, people were able to
claim rewards for anonymous tips by sending in a torn sheet
of paper along with the tip. They could later pick up the cash from a designated bank by producing the other half, and showing
that the two matched. No ids where required.

@_subject: RE: Security-by-credential or security-by-inspection 
I've been thinking along these lines myself - Tim got to the post
There are two points I'd like to make.
1. The reasons which are publicly aired for installing the current
'security' regime are (in my considered opinion) NOT the actually reasons.
US airlines insisting on IDs which match tickets has nothing to do with airline security, and everything to do with extracting as
much cash as possible from the public.
Before the Pan Am 800 accident, when people were freeer, there
was a secondary market in airline tickets which the original purchasers could not, for one reason or another, use. If you
bought a non-refundable return ticket, and then could not
use it, you could sell it to someone who did want to travel
on those dates to that location. The price varied, but was
less than the cost to the repurchaser of buying a ticket from
the airline.
Due to the vast cost differential (up to 10:1) between the cost
of a ticket to fly tomorrow, vs the cost of a 'two week advance,
stay Saturday night' Supersaver, it was actually economic for
large corporations to buy a steady supply of Supersavers, and
hand them out in pairs to execs who had to make quick trips -
it was cheaper to eat the cost of the unused whole or half
tickets than to buy them only when they were needed.
The airlines hated this. The 'you must have a government id
which matches the name on the ticket' rule put an end to
the fungibility of airline tickets, which boosted their bottom
It's got nothing to do with security.
2. The capability vs credential argument runs all through
security. For example: Signed ActiveX code is using the
credential model, while the Java sandbox uses the capability
Another: 'Trust us not to look at your email without a warrant' is the credential model. 'Encrypt your email so they cant look
at it' is the capability model.
Techies tend to prefer the capability model over the credential
model - it not only works, but can be seen to work, and does
not rely on trust. Institutions prefer that people use the credential model, since that allows them to change the rules at the drop of a hat.  You can imagine applying the two models to airline passengers,
both of which would act to reduce the frequency of security 1. Capability model: You don't need to have ID at all, you can
pay cash on the plane (as I used to do on People Express)
but you'll get searched up the wazoo, and everything down to
a too-sharp pencil confiscated.
2. Credential model: You can take your Glock on board,
provided it's loaded with frangible bullets. However you'll have to have biometricaly enabled ID from the NRA certifying
that you've taken the 'Guns on Planes' course, a signed
affadavit from a psychiatrist saying you're sane and not
overly excitable, and a note from Mom saying you can.
Both are better from a security point of view than having unidentified armed people on board.
Always remember: The *stated* reason an institution puts
a restrictive policy is put in place do not necessarily have anything to do with the *actual* reason the institution
wants to put it in place.

As I said in an earlier post, there is usually a gulf - a huge one, between

Consider these actions of Lincoln in the light the above quotes:
From 'Getting Lincoln Right':
Also, should those who debate the greatness of Lincoln
ignore the fact that he arrested and exiled a US Congressman
from Ohio - Clement Valladingham - who was also running for
governor of Ohio at the time, over anti-war remarks made
during a campaign speech?  Valladingham was arrested in his
bedroom in the middle of the night.
Should one also overlook Lincoln's destruction of the rule
of law in "loyal" Maryland? When Maryland voiced its support
for the CSA and appeared itself ready to secede, Lincoln
arrested 31 Maryland legislators, the mayor of Baltimore
(the nation's 3rd largest city at the time), and a US
Congressman from Maryland, as well as numerous editors and
Not only did Lincoln imprison two US Congressmen, he also
wrote out an arrest warrant for the Chief Justice of the US
Supreme Court, Roger Taney, after Taney wrote the opinion in
Ex Parte Merryman (1861) rebuking Lincoln's illegitimate
suspension of habeas corpus (see Charles Adams, p
46-53). John Marshall, whose opinion in Marbury v. Madison
(1803) famously declared that "It is emphatically the
province and duty of the judicial department to say what the
law is," also wrote the opinion in Ex Parte Bollman and
Swartwout (1807) declaring that suspension of habeas corpus
was a power vested only in the Congress. Lincoln simply
ignored the law. Additionally, US Army troops refused to
release Merryman into the custody of a federal marshal sent
by Taney pursuant to the court order that Merryman be freed.
Lincoln, then, imprisoned members of the federal legislative
branch, and also sought to imprison the chief member of the
federal judiciary. What happened to checks and balances?
Lincoln, with the backing of the army, simply exercised
whatever powers he desired. As noted Lincoln scholar Mark
Neely writes in The Last Best Hope of Earth, Lincoln
arrested the Marylanders "without much agonizing over their
constitutionality" (p 133).

"I've got a great idea: Everyone stop playing head games with each other, starting now!")
This is a Really Bad Idea, for a number of reasons.
1. Any system of normalized 'voluntary' labeling has a habit of becoming effectively mandatory - see the content ratings on movies, and now video games and records. How'd you like to see the sorts of ratings you're proposing applied to books and magazines?
I don't want to see pissing matches over whether Alice
applied the right lables, in Bob's opinion.
2. Content drifts on this list, rapidly and frequently. 'Enemy at the door' started out with a truly stupid and dangerous idea for a face-recognition based booby trap, and finished as a  discussion of long-haul 802.11b networks. Asking every  person posting to spend time considering detailed and accurate labeling for every post they make is hopeless.
3. Irony, allegory, and insinuation are an integral part of activity on this type of mailing list, and by their nature, cannot be accurately captured by a rating system. Don't misapply a system created for more-or-less static standalone web pages to a freewheeling discussion list where each message cannot be properly understood except in light of a lot of context and history.
4. The things people complain about are usually much less
about topic, then they are complaints about other poster's positions on a given topic. We don't bitch too much about
postings concerning physics (which are pretty off-topic), but
we waste a lot of bits on bitching about Choate's version of
physics. This kind of thing is also not really captured by a
self-applied rating system.

Pu-241 (a minor contaminant) is a bigger problem since it has a half life

Newly processed weapons grade PU in solid lumps is relatively harmless

Curious. 4-5 years ago Denning and another associate (I forget who, it's in the archives :-) tried to market an authentication
scheme which purported to authenticate the location of a remote
user using GPS. The idea was that the user's machine would pick up the aggregate analog GPS signal available at it's location (either the regular, non-classified version or the high-precision classified signals), and transmit it to the server, which would use it to work out the location of the user - a user who was located at 'Pentagon, third ring, fourth floor, Army segment' would be accorded different privilieges than one whose location decoded as 'Presidential Palace, Baghdad'.
I and several other list subscribers pointed out numerous
issues. Among them were:
1. GPS signals don't work well in buildings of substantial
construction, and the chance of them working at all in a TEMPEST shielded building are about zip.
2. There are numerous DOS attacks available - the GPS
signals are easily jammed. One amusing approach would
be to use GPS test equipment to generate signals appropriate for a different location (eg, Pyongyang) and
beam them at the site to be DOS'd. 4. Conversely, an  attacker could use the same test equipment
to make it look like he's in the Pentagon, when he's actually
in Kandahar.
5. GPS is based on the relative time delays of signals from different satellites. Since network lag of hundreds of milliseconds must be accepted, anyone who can see the same set of satellites as the location to be spoofed can separate the signals from the different satellites, modify the lags appropriately, and remix to generate a
spoofed analog signal.
I sent these concerns to Denning, who replied that she
would address them only under NDA, which I declined to

@_subject: RE: fuel injected firearm 
While I'm not a shootingpunk, here a couple points.
1. The space behind the slug of a man-usable firearm isn't that
big. To get a decent velocity you have to pack it with a propellant
with a high energy content. Gas or vapor phase systems are generally too low in energy/volume  (consider: you can run a
car on cylinders with <100cc of space above the cylinder at
max compression. If you filled the same space with cordite
you'd blow the engine apart instantly).
Using a larger combustion chamber feeding into the space
behind the slug might work (search on gas guns). The whole thing gets complex and heavy, since you have to mix the fuel and oxidizer, and feed in the slug.
2. Liquid propellant guns (search on that term) are well
developed for artillary, but I don't know of any light weapons which use this. LPGs are kind of neat in howitzer type applications because (1) A tank of
propellant & a rack of projectiles takes less space
than cased solid propellant shells, so you can carry
more ammo, and (2) you can vary the propellant
from shot to shot based on emergent conditions. One
neat hack is 'time on target' in which a series of rounds
are fired in quick succession, at different elevations and
propellant load so they all arrive at the target simultaneously.
(the LPG liquid propellant does not need an added oxidizer).

If it's a fake, it's a damn subtle one. I've read the transcript, but not
the tape. The contents do not unequivocally prove UBL to be behind the
9/11 attacks, but it's a very reasonable inference. It does clearly show that UBL claiming to have foreknowledge of the attacks. If you want to go beyond what I consider reasonable, you could argue that UBL is taking
credit for someone else's work.
I find it difficult to believe that someone would go to the trouble of producing a fake,  and not use it to show UBL categorically taking
responsibility for the crime.
I'm inclined to believe the tapes reality.
Facial geometry would be an interesting test. The folks claiming to be
able to spot baddies by facial recognition systems could do an interesting
demo - feeding known pictures of UBL into their system to build a profile,
then seeing the the UBL on the tape matches. I gather the sound is pretty
poor, so voiceprints may not be doable.
Near-undetectable? I don't think so. Convincing human faces are just about the hardest thing to do in CGI animation. Humans are hardwired to recognize and differentiate between faces, and we're very sensitive to fakes. Look at Pixar's efforts, or the recent video game based movie (Final Fantasy???) No one is going to watch the humans in either of those for more than a few seconds without realizing that they are not real. CGI humans are still like dancing
bears - which are applauded not because they dance well, but
because the dance at all. Perhaps, but I'll take the position it's real until more evidence appears
to the contrary.

Ryan suggested earlier that the Ipaq with Fireball isn't up to the task.
I don't think this is correct. I point you to
in which some Stanford students produce a wireless ipaq2ipaq
VoIP system. Biggest problem is that it's simplex, not because
of cpu limitations but rather that the Compaq HW can listen or
make noise, but not both simultaneously. Using a headset which
interfaces through the expansion port might enable you to avoid this problem (and the BT headset could also offload the
codec). A 206 MHz Ipaq would, I think have sufficient HP to do the crypto.
I've toyed with the idea of porting SpeakFreely to Ipaq, but have
not actually done anything at this point.

organizational hierarchy. There is no agreed set of aims, purposes,

This is yet another example of how Western cultural biases have been
proven faulty in dealing with this enemy. The Geneva Conventions were
written with the notion of uniformed, national armies, which placed a fairly high value on their soldier's lives. The warrior willing to die if that makes his or her attack even marginally
more successful was not envisaged in the GCs or in most of Western
military planning, nor the notion of an enemy which provides a major
foe without anything which looks like a uniformed national army. The milspec projectile seem to be optimized for the WWII model of a fairly thin line of engagement between territories under the control
of different powers. In that case, a wound which requires attention, but
does not kill, is ideal - it takes the woundee out the fight, and requires
his side to expend labor and resources to pull them back from the front line and get treated - a single wounded soldier may take one or two more
out of commission for at least a while.
If, however, your opponent is a Holy Warrior who expects and yearns
to become a Blessed Martyr by dying in battle, this doesn't work. On being wounded, his response is not to fall out and call for a medic. He rather regards it as the signal that his opportunity is at hand, and
he might as well make the best of it, since he is already dead.

legalistic grounds under which Shrub is denying PoW status to captured Taliban is another example (one which even many US

I was living in Britain (and of an allowance-recieving age) when

it was a large, heavy, seven-sided coin, bigger than a US half-dollar, and
worth $1.20. It felt good in your pocket. Since then, the Brits have shrunk it to
much smaller size. Do they still call the 1 pound coins 'maggies'?
Actually, the mutability of British currency is quite astonishing to
Bills and coins seem to change size and/or color every few years. Of course, there's a good chance Britain will join the Euro soon, which would
be another change.
Re going back to coins - it's not happening everywhere. The US Mint would love to get rid of the $1 bill, but the proposed replacements have been resounding failures. In the mid-70's they started minted 'pseudo-silver' dollars for the Bicentennial. While fun, these were just too big, and did not work in vending machines. A few years later they tried the 'Susan B Anthony' dollar, but it was rejected as well - it was similar in size and color to a quarter, and the two could be easily confused. Just about a year ago, they tried again, with the 'Sacagawea' or 'Golden Dollar'.
This is a very handsome coin, gold in color, but it was the same size
as a SBA dollar (to fit the machines). You can still confuse it with a
quarter in your pocket or in the dark. It's been months since I've seen

I refer you to the TI RFID FAQ, at to quote:-----------------
4) What is the minimum separation between Tags?
There is no minimum separation between tags. Using the SID
(anti-collision algorithm), multiple tags close to the antenna can be
readily identified but if they are at the extreme reading range, they will
require some separation (5 cm) to prevent mutual de-tuning. If
individual tags are passing an antenna, some separation will need to
be maintained if the anti-collision algorithm is not being used. The
separation is related to the size of the reading zone and should be
sufficient that only one tag is in the field at one time.
5) How many Tags can be identified?
Using anti-collision techniques, there is theoretically no limit to the
number of tags that could be inventoried at one time. Although, in the
real world this is dependant on a number of factors:
1. The size of the reader's antenna
2. RF Power 3. How closely packed the tags are
4. How long you are prepared to wait for the data
It requires a strong RF field for simultaneous identification, as tightly
packed tags can 'soak up' the power and possibly de-tune each other
if they are too close together. Smaller antennas have stronger RF
fields close to the antenna, whereas a larger antenna, capable of
reading more tags, and may have a less dense RF field.
Using simultaneous identification, around 30 tags/ sec can be
inventoried. If you wish to read extra data, the time required will
increase, e.g. to inventory 20 tags and return one page of information
from each, takes 1 second.
Without simultaneous ID, up to 60 individual tags can be read in one
second. -end of quote -----------

Tim: I advise you to get up to speed on this stuff.
I don't recall anyone using the phrase 'micro-strips', which suggests you're
erroneously linking this discussion to the theory that there are detectors
for the anti-counterfeiting strips built into much modern currency. (FWIW,
the old British bills did use a metallic strip - if you scraped off the
over it you could see the metal. US bills use a polymer strip).
We're discussing RFID tags, which are a bit different. In particular, the
mu-tag from Hitachi, which is 0.4 mm square, and 60-150 microns
thick, depending on version. You can see a picture at (the chips are the things that look like iron filings)
There was a good article in the Economist a while back. If you're not a subscriber, it's reprinted (without a registration requirement) at  A presentation can be found at The version with the on-chip antenna has a range of about 1cm. The version
with an off-chip antenna has a range of 25cm (and possibly up to 1 meter). All it
does is
spit back a 128 bit number.
Most current applications appear to be for checking the authenticity of an
item in a
cooperative environment.
So, yes, at the moment they can't scan your wallet very easily. But this
is developing as all others are. I don't know about dealing with many
similar tags
more or less simultaneously, but some of the discussed apps for stock
require dealing with this problem.
RFIDs are very scary from a privacy point of view, and very little attention
is being paid to them. Most are considerably heftier than the mu-chip, but they get cheaper and smaller every year. Mu-chips cost 10-15 cents.
Most people don't, and won't do this. You may not worry about the sheeple,
but I do.

Ken, when was the last time you paid for a call from a UK public phone with coins? Iirc, most British public phones no longer accept coins (unlike in the US, where you have to search for one with a card slot). As the saying goes, 'follow the money'. Handling cash is expensive. It's usually dependent on hand counting and manual change making. These are error prone operations. There is also, in retail situations, the problem of the help pocketing part of the take, not to mention that cash presents a security problem not present with electronic book
transactions. The presence of cash means that you have to buy/maintain/use safes, security services, video systems, etc,
as well as pay higher insurance premiums. Vending machines
have to be heavily engineered to be resistant to theft. Night clerk at a convenience store or gas station is one of the most hazardous jobs available in America. I've heard that security
for cash is a major expense item at the retail level - over 10% of
it's value in some cases.
A system which does not place acculmalate stealable cash  has clear advantages to everyone (but at the cost of privacy and anonymity!). Going to a cashless system would save the vendor money -
perhaps several percent. If they passed on part of this in the
form of lower prices, the consumer could be motivated to accept a 'smart wallet' of some kind.
This actually *is* one of the ways ATMs get attacked, and the newer
ones have quite impressive engineering to hold them in place.
A smart card based system would actually eliminate ATMs - without
the physical security required for cash, you could as easily fill up at any terminal.
There's nothing in it for the consumer until (1) some vendors go cashless, and (2), they pass along part of the cost savings.

As usual, Jim is wrong. There are deterministic systems which never
repeat. For example, there is an algorithm which will give you the
nth digit of pi. If I use this as my PRNG (one way I could seed it would
be to use key to pick a starting point) how long does Jim think it will run
before it repeats??
Exactly what is the Choatian definition of a PRNG which requires
it to repeat, anyway?
Agreed it's not a desireable property, but it's not always present, as
I demonstrate above. It's the 'primary distinction' only on ChoateWorld,
of course.
Choate is the only one who has said anything about using "-only-" digital
gates. You can build analog devices out of silicon, and get Johnson noise from resistors or diodes.  You can also build radiation detectors in silicon,
in the absence of a supplied radiation source your data rate will be low

RNGs and PRNGs serve somewhat different purposes in current
cryptographic systems. Both are useful, but it's not clear to me
that the Gbit true RNGs are needed.
The defining difference between the two is that if you know the
algorithm and seed, the output of a PRNG can be reproduced,
at a different time, place. or both. There are circumstances in which this is very much a desired quality.
For example, in communications using a stream cipher, is it
neccesary that both ends be able to produce that same pseudorandom bitstream. You could not replace RC4 in SSL
with an RNG, since both ends need to generate the same True RNGs are needed for much more limited purposes:
generating session keys, initialization vectors, candidate
RSA prime numbers, etc. The only high volume use I can
think of for a true RNG is the mass production of OTP key material.
So my suggestion is that while hardware accelaration of
PRNGs may have some usefulness, true RNGs need not
have the same performance. I'd rather see people work
on making the true RNGs *trustworthy*, which is a much
more difficult problem.

The primary means to address this issue, dubbed the "analog hole", is via embedded watermarks (which have additional applications as will be discussed below). In order to help plug the hole, watermark detectors would be required in all devices that perform analog to digital conversions.

The MPAA does not have to 'will them out of existance', or even make
them illegal.  They plan to change the broadcast standard so they are not supported.
At least, this is my interpretation:
The FCC has mandated a change to all-digital formats over the
next 5 years or so. After that, analog (NTSC) transmission will
be phased out. There is currently a lot of work being done within
the BPDG (Broadcast Protection Discussion Group) to provide
watermark checking, cryptographic and physical protection of digital video and audio data all the way to the display device, and forbid 'complying devices' from having accessible unencrypted outputs or busses. There are even proposals that if a 'complying device' is found to be hackable, that there should be a backdoor to
enable the manufacturer to modify or disable it remotely.
Until these standards are settled one way or the other, anyone
buying digital video equipment (HDTV or otherwise) runs a very substantial risk of finding themselves with a set of expensive
and otherwise useless doorstops.
Progress and innovation in electronics will occur only
at the whim (and in the interest) of the entertainment industry.

There are doubtless etymologists who could answer this definitively. I don't have aceess to the OED online, which could at least give us

The question on hand is the origin of boot (British) vs trunk (American)
for the storage at the rear of a sedan car.
I really, really don't think either Tim or Mike are on the right track.
American pimp slang is very unlikely to have affected British motoring jargon. Instead, I suggest the both 'boot' and 'booty'
may come from a much older English usage of 'butt' to refer the
the rear end of something - whether a person (buttocks), or the
end of a spear or a cigarette (butt).
Many horse-drawn coaches (and some early automobiles) had
a luggage style trunk strapped on the back for storage. Thiis seems a source for the American 'trunk', and also give an alternative route to 'boot'. Many early automobile terms are from the French (chauffeur, carburetor ), and the French
term for 'box' is 'boite', which could easily migrate in British
English to 'boot'.

- start quote -
The FCC reaffirmed its service rules for the conversion by all U.S.
broadcasters to digital broadcasting services (DTV), including build-out construction
schedules, NTSC and DTV channel simulcasting, and the return of analog channels to the government by 2006.
- end quote -
That's the official USG position 5 years ago. Note the last clause
in particular. Your NTSC set will be a paperweight, at least as far as over-the-air reception is concerned, by 2006.
Now, in reality, the trashing of your old TV may be delayed...
(I'm quoting from  here):
- start quote -
Ending the Transition  By Congressional mandate, the transition period ends on
 December 31, 2006. On that date, NTSC broadcasting should
 terminate and stations should operate in a DTV mode alone,
 unless the FCC has granted a waiver. Any extensions beyond
 the final date will be considered on a market-by-market basis.  Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Commission is
 required to grant a station's request for an extension if:  One or more stations affiliated with one of the Top-4 networks is
 not operating digitally, because the Commission has granted
 the station(s) an extension of time to complete construction;  Digital-to-analog converters are not generally available on the
 market; or  Fifteen percent or more of the homes in the market cannot
 receive a DTV signal either off the air or via cable or do not have
 either a digital TV set or analog-to-digital converter attached to
 one NTSC TV set capable of receive DTV signals in their local
 market. - end quote -
...but it will happen eventually. After the stations are
broadcasting digitally, the analog stations are unneeded,
and regardless of whether the FCC or the station has the
auction rights, they'll want to sell off the old spectrum.
Neither the FCC nor the broadcasters will want to forego
the money.
Well, I'm convinced - I guess that's why every single album today is
released on both CD *and* vinyl - can't piss off the tens of millions of turntable owners, after all. Tim, I think you're missing the point here. Valenti and his ilk would like

they don't have to. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you've rebought some of
your VCR tapes as DVDs. Whey wouldn't the MPAA think they can
make you do it over?
The BCPG etal are moaning about the 'analog hole' because that's the
one they can't easily fix. They've already agreed not to license the marketing of devices with unprotected digital-out (the deCSS case
was about this, remember?) So the 'digital hole' is already plugged -
as more and more devices recognize and respond to the watermarks,
the usability of a ripped digital-to-digital file decreases. Well, Napster just went Chapter 11. Any future system which requires
either vintage or illegally hacked HW will have very limited usage.
I've seen them too - very, very nice!

There are a very large number of families-with-kids out there, and family
viewing is common.
On a side note - the HP movie (which I'm not that fond of) is in
itself an example of the publishers being willing to piss people off.
The deleted scenes (one of the better things you get on DVDs)
where hidden behind a long and very inobvious set of operations
in the 'special features' section, essentially as an Easter Egg.
Not only that, but the operations neccesary to reach them reliably crashed my DVD player, which less then a year old,

In virtually every Open Source project I've seen, the code is signed. Not cryptographically -  the identity of the creator is known to anyone who chooses to look at the code.
If they know that there is a distinct possibility that a large number
of critical, intelligent, strangers are going to be looking over their
code, most programmers will make an extra effort to write well,
by the metrics their peers value. Thus, not only will the code work,
but it will be better commented, cleaner, and clearer. This leads
to fewer weak spots. You can't sweep dirt under the rug if there is no rug.
In an ideal world, of course, closed source programmers would

I remember reading of one of the very earliest fingerprint cases, somewhere in Europe (Austria?)in the late 1800s.  A murder had taken place in a boarding house, and the crime scene was seriously
disturbed by reporters, on-lookers, souvenier hunters, etc. However,
a bottle with a clear handprint was found under the bed.
There were no fingerprint registries at that time. The detective
had to get fingerprint cards for everyone who was near the site,
and found the murderer. The book included a photo of the bonfire
they made of the fingerprint cards afterwards.
Since then, of course, the level of ethics of the LEAs has deteriorated markedly - if they get a set of prints for whatever reason, it is never destroyed.
One civic volunteer program I work with is CHIP, a free local child identification program ( It provides parents with data to help in identifying their children if they go missing. This includes a fingerprint card taken by a policeman. All the data collected is retained by the parents - nothing by the police, and CHIP retains only a permission slip.

[I'm a US citizen who lived for many years abroad, so I have some awareness
of the issue].
Greg's pretty well got it spot on, but I'd like to refine things a bit. If a
citizen lives abroad, the USG will try to extract taxes from both his US
*and* foreign income, beyond certain minimums (the only other countries
which do this are the Phillipines and Egypt, both of which have large
numbers of citizens working in other countries (so they have an excuse, the US doesn't)). If you emigrate and give up your US citizenship, any assets you take
with you above a certain limit (?? $400k ??) are subject to a sort of 'exit tax'. This is an idea the US adopted from the Soviet Union,
where it was used to harrass Jewish emigrants. What is more, the IRS will still claim to be able to tax your non-US income for 10 years after you give up your citizenship (with caps, I think the same as an expat).
This law was put in place not too long ago, after there was a brief
storm in a teacup over certain multimillionaires giving up their
citizenships for tax purposes. In a populist stunt, the USG put in place
laws to punish these emigrants. In doing so they set the asset cap
so low that many people leaving for perfectly legitimate reasons were caught up in it. The political rhetoric around the issue was very nasty - it was clear that the congresscritters could not conceive that any person could have a legitimate, above-board reason to want to give up US citizenship.
Of course, at the moment the USG only occasionally chooses to flout
the sovereignty of foreign nations on issues of non-US citizens, and
it is still pretty rare for the USG to kidnap people abroad. Therefore, if you've given up your US citizenship, and are abroad, you have the
option of telling the IRS to pound sand before the 10 year limit is up.
If you do this, they will try to seize any US assets you may have,
and will arrest you for tax evasion if you ever set foot on US soil.
As Tim would say, check the archives. About 3 years ago, one or
two list members said they were giving up their US citizenship, and taking up Mozambiquian (sp?) citizenship, to enable them to
write and export cryptographic software without being subject to
US control. There was an extensive discussion of the topic at that
So, to the subject of the original question: I don't think taking up
US citizenship, then retiring abroad, makes a hell of a lot of

are important, the total assets taken out are low, and the expected
non-US income falls below the minimum the US allows expats tax-free. There are a lot of other effects of US citzenship vs US citizenship, but those are my non-lawyer speculations on the
tax implications.

I think I do. A 'second hand' root key seems to have some
trust issues - the thing you are buying is the private half
of a public key pair .... but that's just a piece of information.
How can you be sure that, as purchaser, you are the *only*
possessor of the key, and no one else has another copy (the
seller, for example)?

Well, the other possible interpretation is that the Feds are not
black-at-heart, Big Brother, neo Stalinist fascist JBTs pouncing on any opportunity to make confetti of the Bill of Rights;
but rather are actually trying to respond to 9/11 with a minimal

@_subject: RE: Tunneling through a hostile proxy? 
It's been some time since I've worked on proxies, but
AFAIK, SSL connections tunnel through proxies already,
and the proxy cannot examine the content of the SSL
session (though of course, they *can* see where the
connection is headed).
It's easy to check - go to an SSL protected website,
and while viewing the page examine the certificate the site presented you with (click on 'security' in the toolbar in Netscape, or on IE, click Files->Properties->Certificates). If the certificate belongs to the site you're accessing, you're secure
from observation by the proxy. (the proxy can't
act as a MITM if the cert is from the far end).
If you wish to access a website which is not SSL
protected, try  which will encrypt browsing data between itself and your
browser, even for non-SSL sites. All your local
proxy can tell is that you are doing something
at megaproxy (and megaproxy knows everything).
If you're interested in tunneling other protocols
than HTTP, things get more complex. Assuming
SSL tunneling is allowed you can run other
protocols through it if you can set up the software
at each end appropriatly.

AARG!, our anonymous Pangloss, is strictly correct - Wagner should have
said "could" rather than "would".
However, TCPA and Palladium fall into a class of technologies with a
tremendous potential for abuse. Since the trust model is directed against
the computer's owner (he can't sign code as trusted, or reliably control which signing keys are trusted), he has ceded ultimate control of what he can and can't do with his computer to another. Sure, TCPA can be switched off - until that switch is disabled. It could potentially be permenantly disabled by a BIOS update, a security patch, a commercial program which carries signed disabling code as a Trojan, or over the net through a backdoor or vulnerability in any networked software. Or by Congress which could make running a TCPA capable machine with TCPA turned off illegal.
With TCPA, I now have to trust that a powerful third party, over
which I have no control, and which does not necessarily have
my interests are heart, will not abuse it's power. I don't
want to have to do that.

@_subject: RE: today in dc 
Actually, this clicks neatly onto cp debates over open vs closed
systems, TCPA, DRM, and 'freedom to hack'.
Most modern cars are substantially computerized. Diagnosing a
problem usually involves hooking up a PC to a port on the car's
engine management system, and studying the readouts.
The 'problem' that the congresscritters are trying to 'solve' is
that some car manufacturers are now closing this interface -
they are refusing to document the protocols, and/or encrypting
the data.
As a result, the manufacturers are able to restrict who has
access to this diagnostic data, and are using this power to
shut out independent repair shops and other competition to
their own dealerships. The meeting is going to discuss whether 'something should be done'. I have no idea what will
happen, if anything.
So, let's see:
* The manufacturers are using DRM technology, including crypto,
to restrict access to the data.
* If you reverse-engineered the system, the DMCA could get
involved (not sure on this one).
* The manufacturers are closing the system to outside inspection,
and actively working to make it impossible for owners to tinker with or modify their own cars. * There is absolutely no benefit to the car's owner - this is simply
large corporationsfiguring out another way to get more revenue.
This is essentially 'Palladium for cars'.

It's rare enough that when a new anononym appears, we know
that the poster made a considered decision to be anonymous.
The current poster seems to have parachuted in from nowhere, to argue a specific position on a single topic. It's therefore reasonable  to infer that the nature of that position and topic has some bearing on the decision to be anonymous.
Since the position argued involves nothing which would invoke the

2. If the true identity of the poster became known, he/she/them
fears some kind of retribution:
* The ostracism and detestation of his peers.
* The boycotting of his employer. * His employer objecting to his wasting company time on   Internet mailing lists.
Our corrospondent has not given us any reason not to infer the worst motives. This is, after all, a discipline where

@_subject: RE: OT, but fun: Re: Homing In on Laser Weapons  (was Re: US 
This is a game we can all play. Lasers as weapons have 3 major modes of action.
1. Blinding sensors. This could be temporary, or permanent,
depending on the sensor and the power level. Firing 100kW at
a Sidewinder, Copperhead, or modern equivalent would probably
ruin it. Ditto for laser or video guided precision muntions. (Note
that human eyeballs count as sensors for this purpose (ugh!)).
2. Burn-through. If enough energy is absorbed by the target, it
heats to the point where it starts to lose structural integrity. This can directly make it useless, set fire to internal components,
fuel, or explosives. A missile under thrust is highly stressed,
and can buckle. A airframe can lose streamlining, and rip apart.
Usually requires a lot of power.
3. Ablative blast. A short, intense hit with a laser can cause the
a thin layer of the surface to vaporize. This vapor expands very rapidly away from the underlying surface, and due to conservation
of momentum, provides a physical blow to the remaining material.
Requires a brief, high-intensity pulse. Wavelength changing won't help with clouds much (that's why they're white).
Suspended droplets of water are going to disperse any wavelength they don't
absorb. At higher energies, you could burn a hole through the cloud, but
leads to other problems.
For a start, the cloud is moving, so the hole is not stable. Second, a high
intensity continuous beam causes 'thermal blooming'. When the laser heats
the air within it's beam, that air expands, lowering it's refractive index
with the surrounding air. This causes the beam to refract outwards, like the
bell of a trumpet.
At even higher powers, the air itself will ionize. The plasma is highly
Some of these problems can be avoided by using very short pulses. Also, if
laser is mounted in an airplane, the beam is, for most of it's path
travelling through 'fresh' air. One other trick would be to use a 'target designation
of one wavelength, and then have two or more weapon lasers converge on the
designated target simultaneously from different locations. Peak power is
reached only on target.
See 'ablative blast' above. This might work for a ground target, but a airborne one would have real problems.

Software leaves encryption keys, passwords lying around in memory
       Monty Solomon         Wed, 30 Oct 2002 22:31:46 -0500
                Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2002 05:11:31 +1300 (NZDT)
       From: pgut001 (Peter Gutmann)
       Subject: Software leaves encryption keys, passwords lying around in
       The following problem was first pointed out (in private mail) by
       Howard from Microsoft.  His writeup is now available at
       From a representative check of a few widely-used open source crypto
       programs, this affects quite a bit of software.
       The problem he points out is that clearing sensitive information such
       encryption keys from memory may not work as expected because an
       compiler removes the memset() if it decides it's redundant.  Consider
       example the following:
       int encrypt( const void *key )
         {
         puts( key );     /* Normally we'd encrypt here */
         }
       void main( void )  /* Because we can */
         {
         char key[ 16 ];
         strcpy( key, "secretkey" );
         encrypt( key );
         memset( key, 0, 16 );
         }
       When compiled with any level of optimisation using gcc, the key
       call goes away because of dead code elimination (see the MSDN article
       more details on this, which uses VC++ to get the same effect).  While
       can kludge enough stuff around a custom memory-clear call to fool the
       optimiser (hacks with 'volatile', touching the memory after it's
cleared and
       hoping the optimiser is fooled, etc etc) there's no guarantee that
       work for anything but the compiler(s) you happen to test it with -
       future enhancement to the optimiser may turn it back into a nop.
What it
       really needs is the addition of a        in the compiler.  Until then, a lot of security code will be affected
       this problem.
         [In RISKS, I tend never to alter British spellings.  However,
         in American English, an "optimiser" must be the ultimate miser.]

One interesting variation  {and a suggestion of an alternative) comes from

When there's an official US/UK naval dinner, toasts are drunk (at least on shore or on British ships - I think US ships are dry). The Americans

SLC, while the state capital, and home of the LDS church, has
a comparatively low concentration of Mormons. Provo, which is
the home of BYU, is far more concentrated.
The Mormons have actually eased off on the caffeine issue in the
last decade or so. Coke is now OK. I'm not sure about coffee (part of the prohibition is against *hot* drinks, regardless of content).

Actually, ammunition is not registered as such, but in DC you
are only allowed to possess ammunition suitable for one of your
DC-registered firearms. This applies even to spent cartridge If this guy didn't own a DC-registered shotgun of the same gauge as the shell found, then he's in violation. The car
had California plates, so it seems plausible that he was a non-resident.

Googling on ("event data recorders" automobiles) will give a lot
of hits. For example:
These devices are a byproduct of the introduction of
airbags - the airbag processor stores the data which led it to
deploy the bag.
This can include
delta v
vehicle speed
engine speed
brake use
throttle position
driver seatbelt use
The cited report claims they only store the most recent 5 seconds
of data, snapshotted at 1 second intervals. It notes that the data can thus be confusing - for example, if a wheel leaves the ground
the speed reported can be way off, and if the driver pumps the
brakes, the 'brake use' data is ambiguous. It's not clear whether they
store data continuously, or just when the airbag deploys.
OTOH, I seem to remember reports of drivers of high-end cars (Audis?
BMWs?) getting their warranties invalidated because the main car
computer noted that they had exceeded certain speeds during the
break-in period.
Its not just the airbag computer that can narc you out....

Not personally, but The Net holds all knowledge.

Here's a neat application - 'audio spotlights'. The
directionality of a speaker is a function of the ratio of its diameter to the wavelength of the sound produced - by using an ultrasonic speaker with

@_subject: RE: Idea: The ultimate CD/DVD auditing tool 
I'll ditto that - my brother is an extremist audiophile - he writes
reviews for the high-end stuff (google "Mike Trei"). Many (by
no means all) top end audophiles prefer all-analog equipment,
and direct-cut vinyl records (ie, the master disk was cut directly
at the performance, without a magtape master). I've listened to
some of this stuff, and it just blows digital away.
The general attitude is that while low-end digital beats low-end
analog, high-end analog beats high-end digital. Digital places
a distinct floor on how bad the quality can be, but it also puts
a ceiling on it. The data capacity of a vinyl groove is a lot higher
than a CD pit-track, but you need very good equipment to use it.
While the ear can't hear above 22KHz, signal above that *can*
effect the perceived sound, by heterodyne effects. For example,
if you play a single tone of 28KHz, or a single tone of 30 KHz,
you can't hear them. Play them together, however, and you
*can* hear a beat frequency of 2KHz.

Making a 9-digit number up at random is a bad idea, as it may coincide with someone's real number and cause them some amount of grief. It's better to use a number like 078-05-1120, which was printed on "sample" cards inserted in thousands of new wallets sold in the 40's and 50's. It's been used so widely that both the IRS and SSA recognize it immediately as bogus, while most clerks haven't heard of it. There were at least 40 different people in the Selective Service database at one point who gave this number as their SSN. The Social Security Administration recommends that people showing Social Security cards in advertisements use numbers in the range 987-65-4320 through 987-65-4329.
There are several patterns that have never been assigned, and which therefore don't conflict with anyone's real number. They include numbers with any field all zeroes, and numbers with a first digit of 8 or 9.

Possibly - they're using an ASIC, so I'd have thought that speed would not

I'm not really up on crypto file systems, but I beleive at least some
use the sector address as the IV. IVs don't need to be random,
secret, or unpredictable - they just need to be unrepeated. (I'm
assuming sector-at-a-time encryption).
Having the user generate the key and load it on the dongle means that he has good assurance that the manufacturer doesn't have the key. Any kind of backup will open a possible route of
attack. If the user can specify the raw key value (it's short - this
is symmetric crypto), they can choose their own backup - up to
and including writing it on paper and carefuly hiding it.

Color me dissapointed. It's a move in the right direction, but I wish they had followed through and
done the right things:
* [AES | 3DES]/CBC with a good distribution of IVs
* User-generated keys (before initial disk setup, of course).
* Shutdown on dongle removal.
* Some kind of PIN or password protection on the dongle.
eNova claims not to keep a database of keys (they don't
say that 'there is no database of keys', which is a little
different), and to get a key copied you have to send it to
them. They do seem to supply a spare.
Back a few years ago, I calculated that with the DES key
search software then available, a single 200MHz machine
could search 40 bits of keyspace over a long weekend. Today it would take a few hours.
40 bit DES is not secure against your kid sister (if she's

The accompanying diagram shows a daughterboard sitting between the HD and the system, with a USB

The USB dongle apparently acts only as a key
store, for a DES or 3DES key. It needs to be
present at boot time. It appears that the key
is put on the device by the manufacturer !!!!
though they promise "Enova Technology does not maintain a database of X-Wall Secure Keys". On the good side, it seems
to encrypt the whole disk, including the
boot sector and swap.
No info on chaining modes, if any, nor of
IV handling. There is no mention of a PIN
or other 'something you know' required to
use the USB key. I can't tell if pulling the

Thats not how it works. The idea is that you make your choices on
the machine, and when you lock them in, two things happen: They
are electronically recorded in the device for the normal count, and
also, a paper receipt is printed. The voter checks the receipt to
see if it accurately records his choices, and then is required to
put it in a ballot box retained at the polling site.
If there's a need for a recount, the paper receipts can be checked.
I imagine a well designed system might show the paper receipt through
a window, but not let it be handled, to prevent serial fraud.

FBI Issues Alert Against Almanac Carriers
December 29, 2003

Filed at 7:43 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is warning police nationwide to
be alert for people carrying almanacs, cautioning that the
popular reference books covering everything from
abbreviations to weather trends could be used for terrorist
In a bulletin sent Christmas Eve to about 18,000 police
organizations, the FBI said terrorists may use almanacs
``to assist with target selection and pre-operational
It urged officers to watch during searches, traffic stops
and other investigations for anyone carrying almanacs,
especially if the books are annotated in suspicious ways.
``The practice of researching potential targets is
consistent with known methods of al-Qaida and other
terrorist organizations that seek to maximize the
likelihood of operational success through careful
planning,'' the FBI wrote.
The Associated Press obtained a copy of the bulletin this
week and verified its authenticity.
``For local law enforcement, it's just to help give them
one more piece of information to raise their suspicions,''
said David Heyman, a terrorism expert for the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies. ``It helps make sure one more bad guy doesn't get
away from a traffic stop, maybe gives police a little bit
more reason to follow up on this.''
The FBI noted that use of almanacs or maps may be innocent,
``the product of legitimate recreational or commercial
activities.'' But it warned that when combined with
suspicious behavior -- such as apparent surveillance -- a
person with an almanac ``may point to possible terrorist
``I don't think anyone would consider us a harmful
entity,'' said Kevin Seabrooke, senior editor of The World
Almanac. He said the reference book includes about a dozen
pages out of its 1,000 pages total listing the world's
tallest buildings and bridges but includes no diagrams or
architectural schematics. ``It's stuff that's widely
available on the Internet,'' he said.
The publisher for The Old Farmers Almanac said Monday
terrorists would probably find statistical reference books
more useful than the collections of Americana in his famous
publication of weather predictions and witticisms.
``While we doubt that our editorial content would be of
particular interest to people who would wish to do us harm,
we will certainly cooperate to the fullest with national
authorities at any level they deem appropriate,'' publisher
John Pierce said.
The FBI said information typically found in almanacs that
could be useful for terrorists includes profiles of cities
and states and information about waterways, bridges, dams,
reservoirs, tunnels, buildings and landmarks. It said this
information is often accompanied by photographs and maps.
The FBI urged police to report such discoveries to the
local U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

start towards building a self-sustaining colony, instead
of rushing to get science done before a return trip.
Frankly, I'd like to see Mars terraformed - start by diverting
a comet or two to strike it and thicken the atmosphere so things
warm to the point where only respirators and warm clothing are needed instead of spacesuits. At the moment, the highest temperature reached anyplace on Mars is +50F or so, but the rover expects to see night time lows of -150F (FWIW, my town expects -18F tonight, and -50F on top of Mt.

Dean should come clean on privacy
January 26, 2004, 4:00 AM PT
By Declan McCullagh
After Howard Dean's unexpected defeat last week in Iowa, public attention has focused on his temper, his character, and that guttural Tyrannosaurus bellow of his not-quite-a-concession speech. But Dean's views on Americans' privacy rights may be a superior test of his fitness to be president.
Dean's current stand on privacy appears to leave little wiggle room: His campaign platform pledges unwavering support for "the constitutional principles of equality, liberty and privacy."
Fifteen months before Dean said he would seek the presidency, however, the former Vermont governor spoke at a conference in Pittsburgh co-sponsored by smart-card firm Wave Systems where he called for state drivers' licenses to be transformed into a kind of standardized national ID card for Americans. Embedding smart cards into uniform IDs was necessary to thwart "cyberterrorism" and identity theft, Dean claimed. "We must move to smarter license cards that carry secure digital information that can be universally read at vital checkpoints," Dean said in March 2002, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. "Issuing such a card would have little effect on the privacy of Americans."
Dean also suggested that computer makers such as Apple Computer, Dell, Gateway and Sony should be required to include an ID card reader in PCs--and Americans would have to insert their uniform IDs into the reader before they could log on. "One state's smart-card driver's license must be identifiable by another state's card reader," Dean said. "It must also be easily commercialized by the private sector and included in all PCs over time--making the Internet safer and more secure."
The presidential hopeful offered few details about his radical proposal. "On the Internet, this card will confirm all the information required to gain access to a state (government) network--while also barring anyone who isn't legal age from entering an adult chat room, making the Internet safer for our children, or prevent adults from entering a children's chat room and preying on our kids...Many new computer systems are being created with card reader technology. Older computers can add this feature for very little money," Dean said.
There's probably a good reason why Dean spoke so vaguely: It's unclear how such a system would work in practice. Must Internet cafes include uniform ID card readers on public computers? Would existing computers have to be retrofitted? Would tourists be prohibited from bringing laptops unless they sported uniform ID readers? What about Unix shell accounts? How did a politician who is said to be Internet-savvy concoct this scheme?

OK, I agree I was a bit snarky. Mea culpas below.
Not only that, but it doesn't burn that fast:
"Natural gas is only combustible at a concentration of 5 to 15 percent when mixed with air. And, its flame speed is very slow. These facts may best be experienced by a simple demonstration often done at LNG fire schools. A large pit, i.e., 20' x 20', is filled with LNG, allowing the vapor cloud to drift with the wind. The cloud is ignited with a torch from a downwind side. Ignition typically occurs near the visible fringes of the cloud. The resulting flame front moves back toward the pit at a speed only slightly faster than a walk."
Well, I tried. Every dictionary I checked refers only to direct
solid->gas transition. I'm aware of the effect you describe, but
its not sublimation. See:
If you throw boiling water into the air at -32C, much of it evaporates instantly (the humidity is near zero), and some of the
larger droplets freeze, falling to the ground as ice. No liquid will hit the ground.
Volcabulary flames are about as pointless as they get, so I apologize for starting this one. Mea culpa. I was confusing LPG and LNG. (Some of the sources I looked at refered to liquid propane and butane is LNGs.) Those gases are denser than air. Correctly speaking, they are referred to as Liquified Petroleum Gases (LPG), not  Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). LNG is primarily methane,  which, as you say, is lighter than air.

Bob: Get your facts straight:
* Evaporating LPG (liquids do not 'sublimate') will burn at the   interface where the proper mixture is obtains - and the heat
  from that will speed the evaporization of the rest.
* LPGs (both butane and propane) are denser than air.
  Propane has about the same density as CO2.
  Butane is even denser. They will both travel downhill
  and pool in low spots. * LPGs can most definitely asphyxiate you.
"LPG can form a flammable mixture when mixed with air. The flammable range at ambient temperature and pressure extends between approximately 2 % of the vapour in air at its lower limit and approximately 10 % of the vapour in air at its upper limit. Within this range there is a risk of ignition. Outside this range any mixture is either too weak or too rich to propagate flame. However, over-rich mixtures can become hazardous when diluted with air and will also burn at the interface with air."
"LPG vapour is denser than air: butane is about twice as heavy as air and propane about one and a half times as heavy as air. Consequently, the vapour may flow along the ground and into drains, sinking to the lowest level of the surroundings and be ignited at a considerable distance from the source of leakage. In still air vapour will disperse "At very high concentrations in air, LPG vapour is anaesthetic and subsequently an asphyxiant by diluting or decreasing the available The 'rise to the sky and disperse' stuff you're talking about applies
to hydrogen, not LPG. A massive LPG spill will spread out over the surface of the ground and water, and when a source of ignition is found,
the whole mass will burn at the interface where it mixes with air.
You might also want to take a look at
 "Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Safe Standoff Distance Cheat Sheet"
which reccomends in the case of an 18 wheeler LPG truck to keep
people at least 1996 feet away.

Additionally, I would suggest that the US may be well served by resurrecting
the historic use of Letters of Marque in both the war on Terrorism and the
protection of our coastal environment. It is obvious that the Federal
government is facing many simultaneous missions that take precedence over
traditional offshore environmental protection activities. This necessary
overextension, arising from the war on terror, results in shortages of
vessels and crews required for environmental patrols. Letters of Marque,
last used during the War of 1812, effectively enabled privateers to destroy
the Barbary Pirates and is a concept whose time has come, again! American
Fishermen and merchant seamen idled by quotas, regulation, and predatory
foreign competition can be mobilized to patrol the marine environment. They
can also be authorized to seize terrorist assets and provide material
assistance to the families of Americans victimized by terrorism awarded
punitive damages by US courts. Such modern-day Privateers would be legally
deputized to act as agents of the US Courts, the President, Congress, or
State Governors to protect the environment or fight terrorism by depriving
terrorists of their economic assets.

Were they faking it?  The snake, buffalo, deer, and bear I had
had before, and they seemed the real McCoy. We tried to order
elephant, but they were out. If they were intent on fraud, would they have told us that?
Out of curiosity, I asked about sources, and it turns out that, except for the rattlesnake and bear it all came from game ranches, mostly down in Texas. I know they also ranch lion down there. I don't know where they got elephant, but
the source seemed more sporadic.
At the prices they were charging, I'm sure they had no need
to fake it.

As Ian has noted, self-auditability and uncoercibility seem to be to be mutually exclusive requirements.
If you're going to assume that the whole system is untrustworthy,
you're still screwed despite the receipts - if the website says that yes, your vote counted in the final total, that still does not tell you that the right candidate was declared the winner. That would only happen if enough voters pooled their verifications to show that that
had to be the case (this is equivalent to a recount).
In a close-run two candidate race, if a number of voters equal to half the gap between the the candidate's totals failed to verify
and report that their vote was recorded correctly, the result
is still untrustworthy.
....and any system which relies on advanced mathematics
will be unintelligible and mistrusted by the average voter.

Yes, that seems to be the case. Note that in the current

(Non-deliberate losses - such as the recent failure to record cards marked with the wrong kind of pen - can still happen).

A decoy receipt would also have to pass this test.

This is kind of broken. Allowing the voter to get a receipt which
they take away with them for verification may allow the voter to verify
that their vote was recorded as cast, but also allows coercion and vote buying.
To their credit, the creators thought of this, and suggest a
partial procedural fix in the threat analysis document:
The first problem, or course, is that a person under threat of coercion will need to present the coercer with a receipt showing exactly the mix of votes the coercer required. This is leads to a combinatorial explosion of fake receipts that need to be available.
Having only one vote on each receipt might mitigate this, but it still
gets really messy.
Second, it's not clear how this protects against the coercer checking the
ballot online - will every fake also be recorded in the system, so
it passes the online check? Having both real and fake ballots in
the verification server makes me very nervous.
Its possible I've missed something - this is based on a quick glance
through the online documents, but I don't see any advantage this system has over the much more discussed one where the reciept is
printed in a human readable way, shown to the voter, but retained inside the machine as a backup for recounts.

I don't claim great expertise, but....
802.11b/g operates in the microwave range - My home
net falls over every time my kid heats up a
burrito (It comes right back, though).
GSM phones run at a MAX of 0.25 watts (GSM900) or 0.125 watts (GSM1800), but it is normal for the power used to be one hundredth of this maximum or less.
However, the base stations are much more powerful - 50 watts. I suspect the spy-from-orbit stuff looks at this, not the phone transmitter. 802.11b/g typically runs around 0.1 watt, and there is no high-power base station.
If this is the case, then the power in an 802.11b/g
net is 1/500th of that for GSM phones - which seems
to fit in with the difference in range. Phones operate with kilometers to the base station, while
802.11b/g is lucky to cover a whole house.
A big antenna would obviously be a lot of help, but a
smaller one a lot closer would be better. If you insist
on listening from orbit, geosync is probably not the way
to go - you'd want something like the Iridium constellation

Clarke orbit (geosync) is about 35800 km up. You'd get

358km. I suspect that eavesdropping on 802.11b/g from orbit is pretty hard. The power levels are very low, and there may be several nets running on the same channel within a satellites' antenna footprint. My summary: Very tough. Probably not impossible.

way to use the 50 BMG would probably be to hit an
engine intake rotor while the jet is still on the
ground, starting its takeoff roll. This probably
won't kill anyone, but would have a big economic
impact as people decided not to fly.
...but that's still a damn difficult shot. The
target is moving, the bullet has non-trivial
flight time (well over a second at long range).
Getting a first shot hit is highly improbable.
All in all, the 50 BMG vs jet scenario is just
plain bogus.
I honestly don't think that many politicians
wake up in the morning and think to themselves
'What rights can I erode today?'. I think it's
more 'what can I do that will make me *look* good?' . It doesn't matter if their action is
actually effective, it matters that it makes
them appear to be 'doing something' and makes
for a good 5 second sound bite.
50 BMG rifles are used, very rarely, for
hunting. For an example, see:
More people are into very long
range (1000 yard and up) target shooting.
Those are the only 'legitimate' civilian
reasons to use a 50 BMG. It's like owning a
McLaren F1 - you can't use it much, but its
very, very, cool.
As a result, it's difficult for most people to come up with a justification to own one beyond 'because it's very, very cool'.
[I'm deliberately leaving aside the 2A
rights issue (which in a better world would
be then end of the argument) since it doesn't seem to get much traction with most politicians or sheeple any more].
50BMG rifles look very, very, tactical.
I've never seen one with a walnut stock. They are the canonical 'scary looking gun'.
So, the politician sees a type of gun:
* Which theoreticly could be used to do Very
  Bad Things.
* Owned by a group of people too   small to be significant voting block.
* For which its difficult to come up with
  a practical use.
* Which looks very photogenicly scary.
...and he or she thinks 'Wow, a lot of people will feel safer it I ban these,
and I can make them think I'm protecting
them. Also, getting on TV with one of these is a great visual.'
Actual reality doesnt enter it.

Damn hard. There's a reason winghunters use shotguns,

The only way an attacker would have a chance is to stand at the end of the runway, and fire while the plane passes overhead. I have heard of police choppers and ultra lights being fired on from the ground, but never a commercial flight in the US.
The scenario the gun-grabbers posit is someone
doing this with tracer rounds. Commercial aircraft
do not have self-sealing tanks, and if the attacker
is incredibly lucky he might be able to start a fire.
50 BMG can be effectively used in anti-material roles,

The 'stolen gun' problems most of the so-called 'smart gun' proposals
are trying to address are the situation when a cop's own gun is
taken from him and immediately used against him, or a kid finding
one in a drawer. A determined and resourceful person can, given
time, defeat them all. After all, a 'determined and resourceful
person can build a gun from scratch with a small machine shop,
and many do (its not automatically illegal).
I link below to an absolutely bizarre proposal - apparently real
and claimed to be existing in prototype - by an South African inventor to make an unstealable gun. Amongst other weirdness, it fires the specially manufactured cartridges by firing a laser into the glass-backed primer. As a result removing the electronics would make it unusable. You'd have to hack it instead.
This is a typical example of what I meant when I said that
'smart gun' proposals all come from people with zero knowledge of how guns are used.
I strongly suspect that the gun in the picture is
a non-working prop.

Cynically, I'm not the slightest bit suprised that the police
are exempted: 'safety for the government, not for the people'.
A 1% false negative rate is too high. A 50% false positive rate is
*much* too high.
If it's combined with a rule to ban the transfer and/or
ownership of 'dumb' (ie, reliable) guns, then it's also
a backdoor gun confiscation policy.
I'm afraid that they may get away with it. Here in MA, the
only handguns which can legally be bought new are those on a
fairly short list compiled by the State Attorney General which
meet his arbitrary 'safety standards'. If I wanted, say, a
Pardini (a very expensive special purpose .22short target pistol) I'm SOL. In fact, it's almost impossible for MA
residents to participate in some of the shooting sports
competitively, due to the AG's list.

A remarkable number of police deaths are 'own gun' incidents, so the police do have a strong motivation to use 'smart guns' if they are reliable.
In New Jersey, there is some kind of legislation in place to restrict sales to 'smart guns', once they exist. Other types would be banned. (Actually, getting a carry permit in NJ is already almost impossible, unless you're politically connected.)
This particular model seems to rely on pressure
sensors on the grip. This bothers me - under the
stress of a gunfight, you're likely to have a somewhat different pattern than during the enrollment process. Many 'smart guns' also have big problems with
issues which arise in real life gun fights - shooting from awkward positions behind cover,
one-handed vs two-handed, weak hand (righthander using left hand, and vice versa, which can happen if dictated by cover or injury), point vs sighted shooting, and passing a gun to a disarmed
There are other systems which have been proposed;
magnetic or RFID rings, fingerprint sensors, etc.
The one thing that seems to be common to all of
the 'smart gun' designs is that they are
conceived by people with little experience in how guns are actually used.
To look at a particularly ludicrous example, try
For a gun to work, it is just as important that
it fires when it should, as that it does not
fire when it shouldn't. A safety system
which delays firing by even half a second,
or which introduces a significant false
rejection rate (and 1% is way over the line),
is a positive hazard.
When the police switch to smart guns, and
have used them successfully for some time
(say, a year at least) without problems,
I'll beleive them ready for prime time.
