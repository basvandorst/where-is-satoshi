Welcome to Fedora! You may want to learn how to your updates with a tool called yum. Here's a whirlwind tour of how to get yum configured to do updates for you:
1. save this file locally: 2. open a terminal, type su and give it your password.
3. move the yum.conf file to its proper place with this command:
mv /whateverpathyouusedtosaveyumconf/yum.conf /etc/yum.conf
4. update your system with this command: yum update
Hope this helps get you going! There is some more information about how to use yum to install additional software for your Fedora system at this web address: If you want yum to update your system for you automatically each night, then this is all you need to do:
