What Robert said.
We did not appoint Kevin, so we don't have firing power either. Officially,=
 it was the chair of IRTF who appointed Kevin, so he's the one who can remo=

After a few weeks (at least a week after New Year's), when he's satisfied t=

It should also be noted that although David did so in this case, the chair =

On Dec 23, 2013, at 5:21 PM, Tao Effect a "witch hunt" is taking place, and that this is all based on "conspiracy".
It sure seems like it. More than one person on this list has stated that th=
is is nothing personal, but an employee of the NSA (one of tens or hundreds=
 of thousands) is automatically disqualified from chairing a working group.
The arguments against him are the kind that are leveled against IETF workin=
g group chairs on a regular basis - that they see consensus where consensus=
 does not exist. Such arguments are easy to prove or disprove, because the =
mailing lists are public. I've seen plenty of arguments about whether the t=
wo people + author who liked the proposal vs the one person who asked a que=
stion and never replied to the list again constitute "consensus". None of t=
hose arguments resulted in a petition to remove the chair. I can only concl=
ude that Kevin is getting special treatment because of his organizational a=
ffiliation, which IMO sets a very bad precedent.=20
For the sake of argument, I will concede that all the accusations made are =
true: that (other than Dan) Kevin had the only message to the CFRG list wit=
h a favorable opinion of Dragonfly and that he presented that in a private =
message to the TLS chairs as "CFRG is fine with this algorithm". This could=
 at worst be construed as mismanagement. Yet people present this as a malic=
ious attempt by the USG to subvert the standards process so that people aut=
henticate with a method that leaks timing information?  At the TLS layer or=
 all places. That accusation is baseless and makes no sense for several rea=
 - Nobody uses passwords at the TLS layer. A PAKE has been defined for year=
s, and it's implemented in the most popular library. Nobody cares (sorry, D=
 - If the USG is spending money subverting the standards process to standar=
dize a vulnerable password-in-TLS method, Americans should be worried - it'=
s a monumental waste of their tax dollars.
 - The widespread surveillance that the Snowden documents revealed was all =
done with no cryptography. It was all done by gaining access to the plainte=
xt or gaining access to keys. The agent trying to sabotage the standards pr=
ocess would not be a cryptographer with an  email. They'd be more s=
urreptitious about it. (yeah, I know - that's what they'd like me to think)
I don't know Kevin personally, and have never exchanged a word or an email =
with him, but I believe that he is the target of a witch hunt.
