It will be revealed that he who used biologicals to attack the press was not acting in our name.  These will not be the pages upon which we will write death. We have other messengers and our tidings will soon be delivered.
Grace and gratitude to God.

We were forced into limited self-publication when none of the major media outlets would handle it.  I guess some properties are just too hot.  We find the praise being heaped by these agencies gratifying.  It has created a broader market for what we thought would be a niche property.  Announcements to follow.

Capitol Hill Anthrax Matches Army's Stocks
   5 Labs Can Trace Spores to Ft. Detrick
   By Rick Weiss and Susan Schmidt
   Washington Post Staff Writers
   Sunday, December 16, 2001; Page A01
   Genetic fingerprinting studies indicate that the anthrax spores mailed
   to Capitol Hill are identical to stocks of the deadly bacteria
   maintained by the U.S. Army since 1980, according to scientists
   familiar with the most recent tests.
   Although many laboratories possess the Ames strain of anthrax involved
   in this fall's bioterrorist attacks, only five laboratories so far
   have been found to have spores with perfect genetic matches to those
   in the Senate letters, the scientists said. And all those labs can
   trace back their samples to a single U.S. military source: the U.S.
   Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) at
   Fort Detrick, Md.
   "That means the original source [of the terrorist material] had to
   have been USAMRIID," said one of the scientists.
