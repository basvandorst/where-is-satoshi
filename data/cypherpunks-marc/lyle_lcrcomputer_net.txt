Not that I would not be a bit miffed if personal files disappeared, but that's one of the risks associated with using a cloud service for file storage.  It could have been a fire, a virus erasing file, bankruptcy, malicious insider damage...  Doesn't matter, you lost access to legit content in the crossfire.
There is always a risk of losing access to cloud resources.  And for years, we always joked in my computer buddy circles, computers know when you don't have a backup.
It's your fault(not theirs) if that was your only copy.
