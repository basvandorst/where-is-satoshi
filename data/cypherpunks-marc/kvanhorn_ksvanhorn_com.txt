As a former believer and student of the Bible, I can assure you that there is no passage in the Bible that says that Jesus was, will be, our should be the *only* person conceived without the benefit of sexual intercourse. And what do you think in vitro fertilization is, anyway?
Many / most American Christians stress that they rely on the Bible as their one and only source of religious truth.  If so, they have absolutely no *religious* basis for objecting to cloning.

I think your aim is off here.  It's the politicians and political appointees who are agitating for this war, not the career military.  A lot of the top military leadership is against the idea of attacking Iraq, I suppose because they have a keener appreciation of just how dangerous, messy, and unpredictable war can be.

If you want to hear it from the horse's mouth, I suggest you read some of Vin Suprynowicz's columns, or his book, _Send In The Waco Killers_. He's been a working journalist for decades, and so can describe first-hand how this process of co-opting journalists works.

Good lord, this sounds like it was practically designed to sabotage the prospects for minorities to excel in mathematics, by encouraging them to waste their efforts on nonsense and useless trivia.

Sorry, but you've got your facts completely wrong here.  Mormons very much consider themselves a Christian church; in fact, they consider their church to be the restoration of the church Christ originally established.  Jesus is a divine figure in the LDS church. He's considered the literal son of God the Father; he's also considered the creator of the Earth, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, and a god in his own right.

Think more literally here.  The prisoners are the entire population of accused persons.  If all the accused (in all cases in the Injustice System) were to reject plea bargaining and insist on a jury trial, then prosecutors would be spread more thin, and would not be able to extort confessions as they do now.
Do you have any evidence at all for this assertion?  It seems to me that you've been taken in by Big Brother's propaganda.  On a regular basis I hear about corrupt judges who act as a second prosecutor, and actively prevent the accused from presenting any effective defense by disallowing crucial evidence and even telling them what arguments they can make.  Too often, the prosecution just needs to convict somebody to keep their numbers high, or police need to make arrests because they've allocated a certain portion of the departmental budget to come from forfeitures.
