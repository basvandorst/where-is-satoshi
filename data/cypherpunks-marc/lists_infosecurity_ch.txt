Yes, i agree, we can find a common point.
We just all need to move in the same direction, with conflicts and
constructive criticism, but in the same direction.
Let's try to sketch down on a etterpad or trac ticket an idea on how to
implement something like this in order to:
- evaluating and pushing hardening of system/network security of Tor nodes
- avoid/mitigate alerts and risks for Tor Operators
That way we can try to match the needs perceived by all different
parties, balancing the risk/return of the initiative.
I'm gonna dump in this email a set of useful links collected during
browsing to do that.
We are probably not interested in Nessus & Metasploit AutoPwn, but it's
important to know that anyone can just aggregate everything into a chain
of automatic portscanning + vulnerability scanning + vulnerability

I like seeing so much discussion on such a simple thing :-)
I remind that this portscan have been done:
- in 10-15 minutes
- while drinking early espresso coffee
- with 2 command line (wget+nmap)
- on a standard debian machine
- with standard apt-get package
- running a hetzner VPS of 6EUR/month
It's not a technically challenging operations and the rules that "if it
can be done, it will be done" apply.
Other people already have done it, but:
 * without good intention
 * without letting you know
Other people with "bad intention" typically target "a single port with a
mass Tor router scan".
The "bad intention portscan" are not detected by IDS and people are ok
with that.
That's not good because this situation trigger the approach:
"what you don't see don't hurt you".
While that full portscan "with good intention":
* is detected
* is publicly made available.
Then people "see it, perceive it" and so consider it like a risk.
That's just hypocrisy.
This situation remind me a thinking similar to supporting "closed source
 * It's better "not to see" so "you can feel more protected".
 * It's better "not to know" so "you can feel more protected".
But that's not the real world:
 * I prefer to keep my eyes open, not closed.
 * I hope anyone there would prefer to keep eyes open, not closed.
IMHO we should only consider, while debating about it, that this should
not be defined as "good or bad" but as "useful or not useful".
About portscan, some common point can be:
* A portscan it's not a sign of compromise *
* A portscan doesn't demonstrate intention to compromise the host, if
not followed by other sign of attacks *
* Any security operator running an Information Security Monitoring
system just know that. *
* Some people will just over-react to portscan (door-knocking effect) *
* Other people are already port scanning you privately (with the
intention to follow-up with an intrusion attempt).
Now i am even more convinced that it's good to do it.
Now i am even more convinced that's stupid to say:
Now i am even more convinced that this activity has to be done, because
a "good intention proactive approach" it's better than just passively
waiting for "bad intention proactive approach".
However, within the next couple of week i will not have much time to
work on it, i hope others will do and i am willing to provide some help.
While doing, the following best practice should IMHO follow:
* Setup a web server explaining the action on the scanning IP
* setup a reverse DNS like
* Advice the IP address of scanning onto the mailing list
I am confident that, following that early over-reaction, it can be
reasonably agreed that the medium terms results of an initiative are
positive and not negative.
In the meantime if anyone is interested in making a lawsuit against me
due to a portscan: please do it!
But think twice before: As i will publicly ask for legal support from
EFF against censorship actions coming from Tor Operators! :P
Let's joke, don't be too much serious :-)

That's probably the rate used to get fast scanning (-T Insane) that
caused triggering of an IDS alert (number of packets / time).
Apologise for that (it probably sent 1354 packet in 1 second).
Howevr this behaviour could be fixed by reducing the rate of packet
sending, spreading the portscan during a long time.
The "-F" of nmap scan 1-1024 port + /etc/services.
Nmapping from a debian system they are 1354 port.
If we would send "1 packet" every minute, it would take about 22hours to
complete the scan, bypassing almost any portscan detection system.
That way it would still be possible to map the opened ports / service
version, but without creating alarm or abuse complain.
What do you think?

Well it sounds reasonable not to publish the results.
At the same time having a Metasploit auto-pown module that try to
exploit the machine to trigger automatic-update would also be a cool
idea! (i'm joking :P).
I mean, it doesn't sounds to me a so strong "tabu'" to portscan all the
Tor servers.
I agree that's a problem when portscan get out from your tor exit node
and you got a server-takedown from the isp (it happened to me!).
But don't see big problem in receiving a portscan / app fingerprinting /
vulnerability scanning on my node (as long as it doesn't effectively
impact the performance of my node), if this could be helpful in letting
eventually unsecure nodes to get notice about their vulnerabilities.
It would be also nice for example to create a sort of "Best Practice"
for the Firewall ports that a Tor Exit node can have opened respect to
the world (other than Tor-related ports).
For example, in the nmap output of portscan of all tor exit, there are
hosts on the internet with Unix RPC services, Microsoft SMB, SQL Server,
Mysql, etc.
If you would setup and manage a networks (of routers), would you want
your to run SQL Servers or NFS on your routers?
Probably you would like to have your routers very well hardened, doing
their routing job and eventually few other facilities that cannot impact
the main functionality security and stability.
Also i understand that a lot of people would run Tor on the server they
have, doing "multi-purposes" activities, and that's good.
But i also understand that if we would analytically see different risks
context and the likelihood of a compromission of a Tor router, we would
agree that servers with a lot of internet-exposed services are more at risk.
It would be very cool if all Tor Routers would portscan each others and,
depending on the amount of non-tor related port open, would provide a
"security rating".
The security rating could also be measured depending on the version of
Tor used, if it's up-to-date and there are no "security bugs" in the
running version.
That way the would be some objective evaluation, following a compliance
with a "Best Practice", of which is a Secure Tor Router and which one is
A user may decide to only use as entry and exit-nodes, tor routers that
have a high "security rating" level.
However those are just a set of sparse ideas by writing while thinking.

The law, in Europe, typical prohibit to break into other systems but
doesn't prohibit in any case to scan an existing system.
The scanning can be considered illegal if the "intention" you had was to
break into the system.
For example the EFF SSL Scan, or Internet Worm scanner doesn't target to
"break into your system" and so are scan that can be done.
The same, what's the problem in receiving a scan on your machine?
Please, get an public IP address, don't announce it, don't do anything.
Now please have a look, without even being a Tor Server, how many mass
scan your receive.
So please, don't bother with that justification, a scan like that would
probably just be one scan of 10000 you receive every week.
You should be happy to have a free security audit, without any illegal
intention, with free reports sent in your email! :-)
If you want to participate to the Tor Network you must responsible, that
means also keeping your system secure.
If all people running Tor Server doesn't care about the Security of
their systems, then it's worthless to run a Tor Server.
Do bitcon mining and donate results to EFF, but don't run Tor Server.
However yes, everything it's open and must be open.
If an automated scanner run by a Tor friendly person find a
vulnerability of your system, you should be VERY HAPPY because the
vulnerability will not exploited by a Tor unfriendly person.
Security trough obscurity doesn't scale, so what' the problem?

nmap -iL /tmp/Tor_ip_list_ALL.csv -F -sS -sV -PI -T Insane \
-oM Tor-Scan-20-12-2011_00_30.out
You can find the result here:
It would be interesting to analyze it to understand "what's running" on
Tor Exit and Tor Relays, eventually make up some kind of network
monitoring systems like it's done for Enterprise Security Monitoring
IE (automatically):
- Having a periodic portscan + application fingerprinting
- Passing the result to a nessus vulnerability analyzer
- Sending the results to the  contact info
- Repeating the tests every 2 week, sending again the result to the
contact info
- If a "high" vulnerability it's not fixed automatically within 1
months, publish it to the internet
Or a process like that to always know that the "System/Network" security
of computers running Tor it's ok, and if not ok "do something".
Imho it would not be complicated to setup a stuff like that

May i give you some hints about the future scenarios for which we could
see diffusion in 2013 about the two topic you underlined:
- Anonymous Publishing
One of the new frontieer of Anonymous Publishing is given by the Tor2web
Project that is growing and making important progress, has a plan
( and people
working on it (
With Tor2web you can setup a Tor Hidden Service on your own PC and be
online in matter of minutes, exposed to the internet under *.tor2web.org
(or other domains such as Tor2web.is and other will come).
You may even place in front of your TorHS, internet-exposed via Tor2web,
a CloudFare.net frontend or other "cloudizer" to improve performance
improved caches.
Additionally, i hope that we will see a new wave of "anonymous
applications" that can be setup easily on your own desktop computer and
easily exposed via TorHS.
This should be enabled by APAF project, now in development as a GSoc on
 .
Think when we'll see "AnonymousBlog.exe", a self-contained APAF
application that let you securely and automatically publish your own
blog on TorHS in a dumb-end-user-proof way, having it automatically
exposed via Tor2web.
When we'll reach that in a scalable way, i think we'll have setup a new
enabled way to use anonymous technology, opening it to end-user also for
anonymous publishing in a "easy and cheap way" .
Please consider that "public disclosure" is the least path that one
should follow in order to make wrongdoing/justice done.
Most "activism" WB sites just born on the Wikileaks-hype but never
organized themselves really well.
With the upcoming GlobaLeaks 0.2 ( for
Windows and OSX we want to remove the requirements to be a "technical
guy" or to require the "support of a technical guy" to be able to
implement an anonymous whistleblowing system.
That way we expect that transparency activism community (mostly composed
by non-techy guys) will be able to engage mostly on the important tasks
of making that job:
- campaigning to sollicitate, promote the whistleblowing initiative
- handling submitted material trough investigative journalism practices
- "act" on the basis of the result of investigations
Then "the public disclosure" things is something to be to make cautious
reflection, to handle it responsibly, mostly because you may seriously
harms some innocent reputation.
Public disclosure is a powerful tool, is required, but to be used with care.

Totally agree, especially it's absolutely reasonable that we will see a
growing number of Applications that include Tor as part of their code

It would be very useful to have an official statement by Tor Project on
the current scalability / performance impact of Tor Hidden Service with
a Guideline to let Application Developer (bundling Tor, using TorHS)
avoid breaking/hurting the Tor Network.
That way the limits are clear and the way to be "Polite with the Network

@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] William was raided for running a Tor exit node. Please help if you can. 
Imho Tor Software should provide by default a little piece of software
built-in to manage abuse complaint, drive abuse complaint, and inform
users about the role of that kind of IP address.
After we introduced an abuse complaint banner within Tor2web visited web
pages, the server-takedown issues has been strongly reduced.
That is because when someone see an IP or website, the first things try
to goes on on the IP/web with a browser, where it find a proper path to
Send an Abuse Request with a useful form that send an email to the
Tor2web node maintainer.
That way:
- The investigator is immediately informed of what's going on, what is that
- The investigator is given immediately a way to get more information
and make his abuse complaint
- The Node owner can receive the notifications much easily (and much
probably!) and can answer
This would probably be something *very valuable* for any Tor Exit Node
maintainer if Tor software would provide such kind of facility to
- understanding of a third party
- drive the abuse/more information request actions
If the law enforcement:
- Don't understand what is that
- Don't have a way (an easy way) to contact the owner of the server
then more probably will proceed "by office procedure" to the seizure.
So my point is that the software itself could be improved to facilitate
such kind of "good behaviour" .

@_subject: [liberationtech] Defeating massive wiretapping with opportunistic, unauthenticated encryption in HTT 
thinking on how to practically challenge the massive wiretapper
(interceping on telecommunication lines/fibers/internet exchanges),
there is a general acceptance that "opportunistic encryption" systems
could be a good approach.
To protect against massive wiretapping of SMTP email that's the approach
already discussed here:
To protect against massive wiretapping of HTTP traffic, the general
understanding is to use HTTPS.
However HTTPS have several serious drawbacks:
- The owner of a website have to pay "more" for the security of it's
web-clients (buy a digital certificate)
- The owner of a website have to pay "more" for the hosting of an HTTPS
site vs. HTTP site
- If the owner of a web don't pay more the end-user browser receive a
BIG SECURITY WARNING (self-signed certificate)
For the reason previously identified the "HTTPS" approach is still very
valuable but it does not scale up to protect against massive wiretapper
intercepting HTTP.
The idea to fix this problem by creating a technology that enable
opportunistic encryption of all data exchanged (via AJAX) by modern
javascript applications by leveraging unathenticated TLS with DHE
ciphers (providing Perfect Forward Secrecy).
This could be realized by providing a "thin" layer of integration into
any existing Javascript application to wrap the XHR/Ajax requests,
proxying them trough a Javascript TLS Client, with some server-side code
acting as a gateway/minimal TLS implementation working within an HTTP in
HTTP tunnelling model.
If a techology like that would exists, it would be possible to integrate
it as part of Wordpress or Django or other commonly used web
This would provide by default unauthenticated TLS encryption for most of
it's web traffic, with perfect forward secrecy, without HTTPS.
I tried to summarize the idea on the Forge (Javascript TLS stack) github
issue at  .
I know that this kind of argument attract crypto-trolling ("Javascript
encryption" and "Unauthenticated encryption" and "Opportunistic
encryption") but i think that it's worth discussing because it could be
a revolutionary approach to challenge massive wiretapping.
What does various people think about this approach?
