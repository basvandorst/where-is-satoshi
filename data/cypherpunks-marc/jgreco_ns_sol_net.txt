You do realize that it is completely common for "looking" at them to
take months.
This is a big thing to people in this community, because the police
will happily come and confiscate the tools you need to do your job,
and not return them for months, years, or sometimes even ever, even
in cases where it seems fairly straightforward to identify that the
person has done nothing wrong.  The police, and many of the policies
surrounding this issue, often assume that the party is guilty, and
also assume that seizure isn't a significant professional issue.

Oh please.  I don't know where you've been hiding out for the last half
a decade or so, but around here, every McDonalds, Starbucks, Sam's Club,
Home Depot, Lowe's, and most libraries, hotels, hospitals, and laundromats offer WiFi, and those are just the ones I can readily think of.
The level of wishful-thinking implied by the quoted text about how the
Internet works is mind-boggling.

So if we can choose convenient definitions for the sake of discussing
the issue, this is a pointless discussion, because you'll use your
preferred definitions and I'll use mine, and we'll both be right by
that logic.
Tunnels and VPN's are a fact of life on the modern internet, though.
Those could be considered services.  Or they could be considered part
of the infrastructure.
From my point of view, they're just a way to attach to the Internet in
order to gain specific characteristics (a secure pathway, or IPv6, or
whatever).  When you look at it like that, Tor looks suspiciously similar to that, in that it's just a way to attach to the Internet in
order to gain anonymity - a characteristic.  The traffic flows through
a Tor node in much the same way as traffic flows through a NAT gateway,
being modified a bit in the process.
You could say the same thing about Internet Service Providers.  But
ISP's have cried foul at that for years, and even got significant
protections embodied in law.

I'm trying to remember when ISP's became common carriers...
Great point.
The question might also revolve around this issue, restored from the
previous msg:
Well, an ISP does do that, but so does an end user's network.  So if
I put a Tor node on an ethernet ("PHYSICAL infrastructure") and then
connect that to an ISP ("other PHYSICAL networks"), that doesn't make
for a real good way to differentiate between an ISP, a commercial ISP
customer who gets routed IP networks via BGP, or an end user who has
an ethernet behind a NAT gateway.  ... JG

Something like tor doesn't work if it is all traffic that's "free speech" regarding the regime of whatever country the user lives in.
If it were, it'd be just as sensible to set a DETAIN_AND_TORTURE_ME
bit on your IP traffic instead.

Those who do not remember history... what, exactly?
We're doomed to repeat this over and over even if we remember it.
Even if we were to assume that there are no "bad actors" in law
enforcement, what happens when someone is simply faced with something
so complex that they don't really understand it?  The conventional
wisdom is to seize it and let experts work it out.
But there is the possibility of there being so much data, and such
complexity in modern systems.  What happens when you've got a Mac
and you're running VMware Fusion and you've got VM images sitting
on a NAS device?  Ten or twenty years ago, "nab all the media" was
pretty straightforward in the average case, but these days, it's
pretty easy even for Joe Sixpack to have some sophistication and
to be storing stuff on a NAS device.  If you have an iomega ix2-dl
with two 4TB hard drives in it, and the thing only reads out at
~60MB/sec, how do you effectively deal with that?  You can either
seize it or not.  You can't realistically analyze the whole thing
on site.  You can't realistically copy it in place (two days to read it all!).  So you seize it.  And what happens when it is reliant on other stuff on the local network?  And what happens when the police can't quite figure out the way everything worked together?
Heaven help us when we start talking about tech-sophisticated users
who employ things like encryption and run multiple levels of
abstractions.  And that brings us to Tor...
The flip side to the coin is that there is such little disincentive
to be aggressive in seizures.  There are any number of examples of
overreach, and since there is virtually no personal risk to the authorities responsible, even if the company is successful in
filing suit (see SJ Games).  The authorities have one hell of a problem going forward.  I hope
that part is obvious.  ... JG

Actually it might not be so horrible if the law was rewritten to be
more reasonable, and then on top of that if the executive branch would
stop inventing new definitions for words used in the law.
However, we shouldn't rely on either of those two things.
But the other big giant fail here is that we, as the engineers who have
built all this stuff, have made it exceedingly easy for users to "just
sign up with Gmail" and have totally failed at providing easy alternatives
for the average person to use.  That includes building intelligent, secure,
and easy-to-use security into MIME and email, and extends to policies by
ISP's designed to make it difficult to run your own server/services, and
winds up with software authors who totally fail at creating usable server
implementations.  And that's just a broad brush.  There are more failings
than that.
Reducing or eliminating the third party involvement in operating services would severely impact the ability to perform the sorts of blanket surveillance that we've seen.
There's no technically valid reason that my mother couldn't host and run
her own e-mail server on her home Internet connection.  Except that she
doesn't have a fixed IP.  And there's no software that would make it trivial for her to do so (there are honorable mentions, but really this
has got to be nearly as easy as plug-and-go).  The Internet was designed as an any node to any node system.  The
insertion of ISP mail servers as an intermediate step made lots of sense
back in the days of shell and dialup.  It makes a little less sense now.
But the community is extremely resistant to change.  Certainly Gmail has
no incentive to suggest that people go run their own mail server.  And
we've created enough other roadblocks that it isn't likely to happen.  Sigh.

Well that's all nice and all, but what you're missing here is that this
has very little to do with "laws that are enacted".  When an author of
the PATRIOT Act is filing amicus briefs indicating that the collection
of data being done is not what Congress intended, and when the
intelligence community is busy subverting the common definitions of words
so that they can bend a law that says one thing when read in plain
language but something very different when they use their own private
definitions, then we're pretty far outside the scope of "law."
We've been hearing for some years now that the way in which the PATRIOT
Act has been interpreted was alarmingly expansive.  If you choose to
start redefining words, you can probably find a way to make the
Constitution say "every child has a right to a puppy."  Doesn't actually
mean that it actually says that though.
Feingold must be having such an "I told you so" moment.
