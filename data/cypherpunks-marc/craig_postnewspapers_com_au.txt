comp.lang.python is gatewayed to this mailing list, and vice versa. You
just posted on c.l.p .
If you want to access it over NNTP as a newsgroup, rather than receiving
it as a mailing list, you just need to ensure you provide your
newsreader with a news server that you have access to. Most ISPs provide
news servers, often at 'news.ispname.net' if the ISP is 'ispname.net'.
You need to get the correct details of which news server to use from
your ISP and configure your newsreader to use that. Once your newsread
is talking correctly to your ISP's news server, *then* you can subscribe
to comp.lang.python.
