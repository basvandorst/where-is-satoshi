 Subject: [Announce] HavenCo Sealand Remailer Online (remailer.havenco.com)
 Date:    Sun Sep 16 07:02:13 UTC 2001
After over a year of having HavenCo's facilities on Sealand open for
customers, I have decided to set up a remailer on a spare machine.  In light of recent events in NYC and DC, and the near certainty of both future legal actions against individual liberty in the name of "security", and possible extra-legal/terrorist action against critical parts of the Internet infrastructure by various parties, it seems prudent to establish secure offshore services as soon as possible.  Hopefully this remailer can be a small part of that.
I'd also be happy to host a private operational list (i.e. remops minus
several specific people) for remailer operators, as Len suggested a while
I plan to offer several interesting services from Sealand in the future:
      - a mail-to-news gateway (at least for interesting groups)
      - SSL web-to-remailer
      - nym services
      - possibly secure web-based email
      - possibly secure IMAP/POP3 over ssh/ssl
      - possibly "agents" which act on email messages, within certain
        sandbox environments (user-defined autoresponders, etc.)
      - secure mailing lists, archives of some security-based mailing
        lists (cypherpunks to the beginning, coderpunks, cryptography,
        remops, etc.) with full-text search
These services are in addition to HavenCo's high security managed
colocation, consulting, and software development.  More information is
available at My primary concern is limiting the usability of these services for HavenCo AUP violations; specifically spam and spam-mailbox.  A per-message
charge or decrement would likely accomplish this, along with either payment
or proof-of-work.
My goal is to make all services for pay as soon as a suitable payment
infrastructure is deployed.  Donations to support the remailer may be
made through  account 191914 with "remailer" in
the memo line. Config for remailer.havenco.com is:

@_subject: Re: [havenco-discuss] Re: [Announce] HavenCo Sealand Remailer Online 
I'm not sure if I buy that remailers are even going to have serious
problems in the future.  I see two approaches:
1) The aforementioned ecash-based system.  We don't have a problem
getting people to smuggle drugs, because people in the drug game get
lots of money, women, cars, etc.  I wonder how many drug dealers would
do it just for "moral goodness" (actually, a lot of last-stage dealers
do that, just buying for their friends and distributing, which
obviously doesn't work for remailers; also, allegedly the LSD
distribution chain is mostly profit-free for the whole thing...in
general, though, drugs are a highly profitable industry).
2) A system which remails without the consent of the remailing; a worm
or something which roams, infects, and as payload, will spontaneously
form "cells" in a mix-net.  Lots of ways to do this.  Also, the
mix-net itself can be used for passing the messages around.  Using anonymous services like yahoo for this kind of thing is one form, but
something which went a step beyond, and actually took over random
machines on DSL, etc. to use as middleman remailers, would be taking
this to another level.  Additionally, I think a level of steganography
is needed, both to protect the compromised nodes from detection and
disinfection, and for general security.
I generally agree with your assessment of the current "amateur"
remailer network, modulo the fact that a lot of remailer operators
have legal background, and would be content to actually fight
protracted legal battles.  I guess a lot of them would fold fairly
quickly if it were actually unequivocally exposing themselves to
serious criminal liability.
I don't think we'll have to wait long for this kind of theorizing on
anonymous communications and prosecution to no longer be merely academic.

Quoting David Honig :
That's exactly what I meant by "proof of work".  This topic has been discussed
on p2p lists (mainly by the freenet people), as well as other places.  Fundamentally, though, I don't like the idea of providing a service based
on "burning" human or computer time; this is deoptimizing best-case performance in order to improve worst-case.  And I *do* want automated
programs to be able to use the remailer network, blacknet style.
Other proof of work systems are entirely automated; such as adam back's
Already on the search engine sites which require "read these numbers" to
enter a URL, there are other sites which advertise "all new codes, all
the time".
The only viable long-term solution I see for most of these things is charging per-transaction for messages.  Remailers are exactly the kind of
application where "postage" could first be applied.  The problems seem 1) Remailer operators are exposed to new and additional legal threat if they
accept payment for service (right?)
2) It's much easier to trace payment instruments than remailer messages.
While a blinded cash system might only leak "this person is using the
remailer payment system", and not provide linkability to given messages,
it does complicate things substantially, and provides the potential for
a lot of tracing.
It would be an interesting experiment to simultaneously offer a "proof of
human work" system,  a "proof of computer work" system, and a pay per
message system, both bulk and per-message, and see which is most
popular.  Given the existence of ~20 public free remailers, it seems
unlikely people would use them, except perhaps if they had a good
web-based UI, integration into common MUAs, etc.  This would have the
effect of monetizing cpu time and human-who-can-read-numbers time, which
would be interesting.  (sort of like the "get paid to surf the web" stuff).
What would be really cool would be replacing "decipher these numbers" with
some kind of task which produced actual value, but could be evaluated
either by a machine or a horde of other humans; "prove this theorem", "sort these files", etc.
I wonder if any other remailer operators be interested in such a system.  It
becomes more interesting as the cost of being a remailer increases, of course.

Quoting Phillip Hallam-Baker :
(it's "HavenCo" not "Sealand", just as ZKS is ZKS and not "Canada")
I agree the current climate is substantially worse, in terms of respect for
the rule of law, individual liberty, and the prospects for freedom of speech, than it was before the WTC bombing.   However, none of this was
unanticipated; this incident just accelerates our descent into a future
dystopia of universal monitoring, global statism, and individual subjugation, but does not at all affect where we're going.  We've been on this path for at least the past 50 years, and if this attack and the aftermath pushes us forward another 20 years in a single day, that's certainly important, but no one should be surprised when they look around themselves and don't like what they see.
(I assume you mean legislative/legal/political climate; while the nay-sayers said we'd be out of business before the end of 2000 due to lack
of demand, HavenCo at least is profitable, and I think E-Gold is as well.)
This trend is far more damaging to firms whose core business is not the provision of anonymity and privacy to clients, but which require
privacy and anonymity provided by others to make their services useful.
If it becomes more difficult to provide privacy/anonymity/security, the
demand for such services will increase even faster than the costs of providing them.  Some firms with relatively weak technical or other
basis may be unable to scale up to provide more secure solutions, but the
ensuing vacuum will encourage others to step up to the plate.
The greatest enemy of secure electronic mail, for instance, being widely
deployed is the LACK of widespread monitoring.  If every internet
connection in the US were monitored actively, and the contents were
routinely used in civil and criminal legal actions, technologies
like ZKS Freedom, PGP, SSL would be in far wider use than they are now.
Certainly an argument can be made that it is more complex to offer such
services with active government prosecution in one or more jurisdictions
around the world.  However, certain fundamental technical conditions
do not cease to be true simply due to terrorist action, political will,
or legislative fiat.  Blowing up the WTC is unlikely to have made factoring
RSA any easier than it was on 10 September, it is unlikely to have found
a backdoor in widely deployed symmetric ciphers, and it has not affected
the laws of thermodynamics to lessen the difficulty of defeating steganography.  Sure, identifiable persons, physical assets, etc. can now
be more easily attacked through legal means, at least in most of the world,
and there is public support in many countries for international military
action against others, provided at least a tenuous link to the "global
terrorist conspiracy".  However, the fundamental game is not changed.
All that is required for "cypherpunk" reality is:
[*] at least one computer with secure local execution environment     (processor, some internal secure memory for interim results)
[*] some means of permanently storing data (which can be     unreliable, monitored, etc.)
[*] some means of communication (even highly monitored, maliciously     modified, or other) to the humans involved
[*] plus, for anything reasonable, multiple such setups and some means     of communication among them in a large network, even monitored or     modified, with traffic analysis possibly limited to "a member of the     overall network" where "network" can be massively more broad than     "conspirators").  [*] Code[1].
I think it highly unlikely even a new "War on Terrorism", even if 100 times
more forceful than the "War on Drugs", will be able to eliminate every
last pre-2001 laptop computer, PDA, etc. from the earth, or the ability
for people to send email (even if monitored, and outright encrypted email
is a capital crime) and connect to a global network.  On top of that infrastructure, viable electronic cash systems protected
from traffic analysis and resistant to censorship, anonymous publication
systems, etc. can be built.  Indeed, most of the technical challenges have
been solved since the 1980s; the only difficulty has been general lack of
demand from the public, standard software engineering complexity issues,
excessive concern for legality and intellectual property concerns,
and the distraction of the dotcom boom.  If, as you seem to imply,
open warfare on personal liberty shall be declared, most of those concerns
go away; if it's a felony to deploy ecash, you'll want to be anonymous
anyway, and then violating someone's patent just doesn't seem like a big
deal in comparison.
Sealand's claim to statehood rests on the following argument:
1) An artificial island, Roughs Tower, was constructed in 1942 by the    British Government in then international waters, for the purpose of
   defense.  This island was not constructed for the purposes of extending
   the UK's territory, but only to defend the UK's mainland from air or
   sea attack.
2) Subsequent to cessation of hostilities, WWII, 1945, the UK removed    personnel and some equipment from the island, abandoning it.  The UK did    not return to the island at any subsequent point.
3) In 1966, Roy Bates, a UK citizen, along with others, landed on Sealand
   and occupied it.  It was at this point abandoned for over 20 years by
   the UK government.  Roy, his wife Joan, and son Michael established
   permanent primary residence on the island, renaming it Sealand.
4) Through repeated legal challenges, including firing on ships of the royal
   navy, mounting armed counter-invasion, resolving the issue of taxation of
   UK citizens resident on Sealand as if they were resident in any other
   foreign country, etc., Sealand's sovereignty has been repeatedly reaffirmed.
   We have a large body of supporting documentation from the past 59 years;
   I'll try to put more of it up on our website in the future.
5) Despite the UK extending territorial waters in 1987 to 12nm, Sealand
   was by that point established for more than 20 years, and extended its
   own territorial waters to 18nm the day before.  Similarly, treaties and
   amendments to the laws of the sea in the 1980s prohibiting the construction
   of platforms in international waters by sovereign governments in order to
   extend territorial waters did not apply to the UK in 1942, nor did they
   apply to Sealand when founded in 1966.  Such treaties also support the
   long legal tradition of artificial and reclaimed land being treated as    land for the purposes of international and national law.
None of this has been in the least affected by an apparent new willingness
on the part of the US and other nations to invade arbitrary other nations.
Sealand has nothing to do with any of the recent terrorist events; if Osama
bin Ladin were, for instance, living on Sealand, I would fully expect
Sealand would be asked to turn him over[1] or face invasion.  Sealand's
legal status is NOT the issue; international realpolitik of larger states
vs. smaller ones is much more the issue.  In fact, given such a situation,
it seems more likely they would treat Sealand as a state, and ask us to
comply with a demand placed in such language.
Independently of that, HavenCo operates.  If HavenCo/Sealand is shut down by invasion by the nation of -------, HavenCo can continue to operate
from other locations; indeed, eliminating Sealand would simply establish more
need for our services and ensure our next facility has more customers and
capital equipment than Sealand.

(my thoughts follow; might as well post to the list as well since I'd
love for someone else to provide this service vs. me; I care more
about having it available than the eventual revenues it might bring.
But I suspect I'll do it myself; comments from list people would be
useful though.  I would *love* to be surprised by a new and
interesting security company or project doing worthwhile stuff which I
myself would use, even if it's in competition with me.)
(my goals: 100%+ cost recovery.  simple design, implementation, and
operation.  minimal barriers to entry for anyone.  security against
demonstrated threats, and an explicit statement of what risks remain
and maybe how to deal with them later.)
I'm sure the issue of proxying, general traffic analysis protection,
etc. has been discussed many times by people smarter than me, but this
is my basic understanding: do you agree?  If I can't find something
much better, it would be tempting to write a brief summary paper;
nothing really new, but this is an area where a clearly presented
summary could be useful to designers.  (I just deleted about 5 pages

Yeah, the tricky part is making it pay.  Since bandwidth is rather
cheaper in bulk (especially since you can then peer more of it away),
I figure cost per marginal Mbps is 95% of the previous.  I have a
serious surplus of outgoing traffic right now, as do most non-end-user sites;
something which brought inbound traffic would make peering
arrangements easier.
Any traffic which would go to on-Sealand servers anyway is no marginal
cost to me.  Yet, it provides a substantial benefit to server operators;
sure you're talking to a Sealand-hosted server, but which one?  We
have casinos, payment systems, but also some benign content.  The
benefit there is primarily some traffic analysis protection against
outside parties; but you also gain some protection from HavenCo's
customers learning your identity.  At least with the population of
sites we have now, I'm far more concerned about passive monitoring at
the client's LAN or firewall than anything else.  People will "pay"
with time and money if a product solves an actual demonstrated
problem; getting fired for looking at pr0n at work is one of those problems.
An https:// url with maybe http accelerator cache inside the network
and then displaying content in a frame is a first and very easy
solution.  An entirely server-side url rewriter is also possible;
rewrite the html as sent with keyed hash urls or something, translate
on the servers.  But frame is first since it's simple, 100% server
side, and secure.  This also keeps crap out of IE's url history file, and
I can do nocache-rewritting as well on the pages (will have to
experiment with various browsers to see what that really does).  With
a couple of SSL accelerators, this should be fairly cheap to provide.
I'll use that to determine usage patterns, bandwidth consumed, etc.  I
will add more general-interest servers on Sealand (both customers and
free); and perhaps some kind of USENET service, file archive,
discussion board, etc., which will provide a lot of benign cover
traffic.  One of the better arguments against using HavenCo for
anything very sensitive is that even with crypto to the server, you'd be
giving away your participation in an online casino or porn site or
whatever; this will solve that.
I can subsidize random people text-proxying, but I can't do porn or mp3.
I could charge actual site owners to put their porn on Sealand
(normal commercial hosting arrangement), possibly just as an actual mirror
site, vs. moving their primary, to support HavenCo-proxy customers.
An insignificant part of the overall porn market, but maybe a few of
the ~50-100 *big* porn hosters will put a box there just for the 0.01%
of customers who want to access via HavenCo; they then could get
50-100% of that market.  With http accelerator caching, bandwidth
prices would even be reasonable for them.  I think this was where ZKS
missed out with Freedom; cooperation with service providers to
provide on-network anonymous services, assistance in making their
services privacy-compliant, etc. could have made freedom.net actually
contribute to the meaningful (products sold to businesses, not privacy
hobbyists) bottom line.  Oh well.
We do this already with a "net-10" onsite to allow customer to
customer traffic, infrastructure, etc., but making it transparent to
the server operator and using a proxy in normal address space makes
more sense, I think.  The original motivation for using net-10 was to
make accounting simpler, and to "fail secure" (since net-10 isn't
routed); we have flows-based accounting as a possibility, and if you
want fail-secure, net-10 is still a possibility.

@_subject: Re: "quitting havenco", not quite! 
The remailer has been up since 16 September 2001, and was announced to
this list among others.  Next thing coming is "mail.havenco.com" with:
* [SSL] IMAP/POP3/HTTP/SMTP with domain hosting for customers (point
  your domain MX at us, we'll resell mail accounts using your domain
  name and give you a percentage)
* PGP Keyserver (this is not my favorite software..)
* PGP auto-keysigner which does "proof of control of email address" ID
  signing; KDC for HAVENCO.COM, maybe x509 stuff.  Would be good for
  gale keys as well.
* Local mail archives (SSL, same URL as mail.havenco.com to provide
  cover traffic), googleified.
* Ideally some linkage to instant messaging as well -- SMS to email or
  email to SMS gatewaying, various IMs, whatever.  I have this for
  myself, but it's hard to figure out how to scale.
* Mailing list creation and management
* Some decent linking to remailer network; store/forward messaging
  over remailers, links to reply-block style remailers.  Ease of use
  is more important for most people, so an anonymously-purchased imap
  mailbox is probably good enough in most cases.  Probably start just
  by keeping remailer.havenco.com and mail.havenco.com on the same
  subnet with postfix-tls between the two.
* *maybe* links to some kind of weblog/blog system (I'd actually like
  to write an RFC on how to share "friends" functionality" between these
  systems; it's a semi-complex database issue to do efficiently.)
  although this is pretty far from mail.
* also, continue adding mirrors of various software
Independently of havenco (well, using a purchased box):
* Someone is setting up a file-storage thing with web interface on
  Sealand; might be designed to avoid public-content-hosting, just
  private, not sure.
Followed by: (I have them for myself now, not commercial-grade yet)
* Anonymizing proxy on Sealand, cover general traffic as well as
  havenco-destination traffic.  Free and no ads to havenco-destination
  sites; free and ads and rate-limiting to elsewhere, or subscription.
* VPN services to Sealand (PPP over SSH, some other tools)
Followed by: (unlikely to even break-even)
* Sourceforge-type offshore software development system (basic, will
  roll out features over time).  Will charge for resources, but then
  people can sponsor individual projects, and I'll sponsor ones which
  are either technically or socially interesting.  cvs, a build and
  test farm, www and ftp, links to the mail system, trouble ticketing,
  maybe some links to make it easy to develop and deploy code from the
  same interface (if it's a simple "web service" or something like that)
  The main projects which would benefit are "underground" things like
  dvd players with decss built in (Ogle), or various p2p projects, or
  general circumvention technology, or maybe crypto.  Sourceforge does
  what it does quite well, so for general-purpose code, it's probably
  the best place to host.
I hope to have something as good as sourceforge by summer 2002.  The
mail stuff is mostly done and just in testing, and working out
support/payment issues, so it should be ready in December.

Certainly NSA and NRO have massive amounts of power, but putting that

@_subject: "quitting havenco", not quite! 
Two people appear to have forwarded communications from a
semi-private chat system through two mailing lists to cypherpunks.
("gale" at this stage is semi-private, and this is the first time
anything has been forwarded from it to public lists.)  These people
are no longer on my christmas card list, or whatever.
I suppose I should now explain:
1) HavenCo is now making sufficient money and is stable enough to be
"boring".  This is a *good* thing.  Over the past year we've completed
most of the remaining engineering, and some of our other staff are
taking over more and more of the operations, first and second level
support, and administration.  Nothing really breaks anymore; it's easy
to add new switches and routers without changing the underlying
architecture; it's all operations.
2) I'm hiring engineering and sales managers in the next 3-6 months to
take over more day to day responsibilities.  This is independent of
anything else.
3) I'm working on sofware to automate more operations, and doing
various conferences throughout 2002.  We're also looking at other
sites; when we actually move forward on one of those, it would be a good
test for the software/hardware systems.  (some of these have been
deployed recently.  I can now do an entire new customer install
without ever even seeing the customer's hardware; comes pre-configured
from the vendor with PXE and it just gets plugged in, racked, and auto-configures).  This means regardless of anything else I will be
spending more time elsewhere in the world.  It is silly that I can do
everything over ssh from wherever in the world and yet still sit in an
office a few feet above the racks.  If something breaks, we just flash
to a hot spare machine remotely and then order a replacement.  Worst
case, someone pulls some drive carriers out of the front and puts them
in a different machine; not exactly rocket science.
4) I'm working on a couple of side projects which may be
ready in 2002.  These include some book projects,
an offshore open-source development framework with quality control,
some papers to bring a couple of fields together (crypto to p2p,
traffic analysis to finance), a comprehensive survey of Gerald Bull
and engineering analysis of the supergun, and some ecash and tamper-resistance related projects.  I hope to have "abstract" level
work on all of them completed, and then finish one at a time when I
have time.  Right now, I'm finishing off the completely automated ISP,
and 2 papers.
5) When such things are ready to deploy, I will either switch to just
doing board things for HavenCo, or will stay on as CTO but have less
day to day responsibilities.  Some of them might be done by HavenCo,
which would mean shifting from colo operations to that project.  Some
of them are pretty minor; they can be "trialed" without distracting
from my day to day job.  Most of them would want to be separate legal
entities from HavenCo, but might involve the same people.  The exact
date of any transition is not fixed; I suspect it will be a gradual
process from mid-2002 until mid-2003.  6) Even if I shift to working on something else, it's entirely
possible I'd live on Sealand 1-2 weeks/month anyway.  It's actually a
decent place to get work done, just lacking in entertainment (which
may be related)
7) The process of setting up additional secure colocation centers
around the world is pretty slow -- even if we can do most of the
technical things in 4 weeks, political negotiations with telcos,
governments, etc. take a long time.  They are also not something *I*
am directly involved in.  Also, various fiber projects elsewhere in
the world have been delayed by the dotcom collapse, so the options are
a bit more constrained as to where we can go.  We can "cheat" by
coloing with other people in those markets, with a common management
interface and maybe network -- specialized offshore colo providers,
telcos, or major colo providers who happen to be there.
Motivations for this include:
(I started thinking about this a lot more at HAL2001 in Holland, not
entirely sober I guess...)
1) I have worked 7-day weeks for the last 18 months.  I've had several
trips to conferences, and 5 days of real vacation.  I have slept on
concrete floors and desks because we brought over a bunch of computer
gear before furnishings.  I have missed Burning Man twice, a bunch of
interesting conferences, been woken up at 0300 and on dark boat rides,
climbed around on ladders 300' above the ground attaching lights,
given press interviews with impacted wisdom teeth and passed out at a
pharmacy afterward waiting for a prescription for antibiotics, etc.  I miss {girls, alcohol, sushi, ...}.  SFBA really is one of the nicer parts
of the world, and I've still not yet had a decent vacation in asia,
australia, etc.  It isn't that much fun to have a successful company
if you can't actually enjoy the results (I have 5TB of mp3s, but
haven't gone to a live concert since...1996)
2) That I really want to work on a software project.  I have this
lingering need to do something intellectually challenging -- HavenCo
is certainly a feat of *something*, but it's not a huge scientific or
technical challenge -- more an engineering, political, marketing, or
integration challenge.  Which is nice, but I'd like to do something
which contributes to the scientific knowledge of mankind; I've
taken advantage of amazing scientific advances made by people over
thousands of years, but not really contributed much myself.
3) It's been 24 months since we started, and I'd like to something different at some point, just to see if it can be done successfully
twice.  And I can self-finance it this time, which is a definite
plus. (having gone from about USD 30k in debt when I started HavenCo)
4) Doing sales and engineering at the same time is quite stressful.
It really would be best to have two distinct people doing each role.
5) Good people are cheap to hire now :) (jobs not me please)
6) It would be nice to work on something which isn't "man vs. mankind"
but actually "man vs. nature".  If the world's governments became
reasonable overnight, and people stopped acts of terrorism, theft, or
whatever, there would be no real need for HavenCo.  Yet, there would
still be motivation for doing things which actually contribute to
man's knowledge, ability to conquer natural environments or other
challenges, etc.  HavenCo is a necessary precondition for a lot of
those things, but is not the goal in and of itself.
7) The current market is actually a decent time to set up new
projects; there's no competition since no one else is funded, there
are much more reasonable expectations (HavenCo hasn't IPO'd for
billions of dollars, but we're profitable about 6 months after we
started selling stuff, and growing at a reasonable rate).  Plus, now
that HavenCo is up, it's entirely possible for an offshore-centric
startup to get started with no real expenses; operate unincorporated
or incorporate on some small caribbean island, accept payment in
online currencies, have everyone communicate via PGP or ssh to the
box, and colo initially one but then several boxes with us.  Many
of our customers operate exactly like that.  For a sufficiently interesting project, we might even invest a box or two in it; so you could have zero startup or monthly costs during development.  8) I can.

@_subject: What to back an ecash issue with, structure 
I've read quite a bit about free banking.  The idea of using a
purely-technical basis for a currency, and then allowing it to float,
is interesting -- as is linking to an external accounting system, and
only issuing based on that.
I think the greatest threat to an electronic cash system is 1) not
being deployed 2) not being adopted once deployed.  So I'd be inclined
to go for something simple vs. complex, in backing it -- a warehouse
full of cash, or gold, or whatever else, controlled by a legal entity
which sets a redemption policy.  Trying to explain free banking to
someone becomes complex.
Without a market, automated price presentment in converted form,
etc. users would be annoyed/confused by a free-floating currency.
While I suppose the mint could issue 1m tokens by default, and an
issuer could sell them at a rate on the open market for USD 1/token,
such that the market value does not fluctuate, then you lose the mint
being able to publish treasury and float figures.  I think placing
those two figures into the mint and signed by keys only the mint has
would do more to reassure users of stable currency value than a
potentially-shadowy issuer.  Issuer sets aside $x and tells the mint,
mint issues x tokens, tokens trade near $1 each, and if the issuer
wants to expand the issue, the issuer either devalues the currency, or
adds more money.  This way the issuer could retain a constant unit
price while starting with, say $10k of cash for 10k units, selling
those, then issuing more. There are a lot of interesting experiments, but most of them are only
interesting once a basic level of infrastructure is deployed.  First
simple mints, then a market, then more sophisticated, derivative,
etc. issues, then security features.
A purely-technical "high-power money" experiment would be fun, and
might be a better basis for issues than "mint in control of bank
accounts externally" or "external issuer banking issue", but
it's more complex to deploy.

Quoting jamesd :
I would say "overcautious", at worst.  Lawyers tend to be.
Entrepreneurs tend to be overoptimistic and risk-taking.  It seems to
balance out over time.  I think there are more "entrepreneurs" of
various legal and illegal forms in prison than lawyers.  But,
few innovations come from lawyers, either.
Banking havens have folded in the past 30 years.  No one provides
anonymous banking to joe random off the street anymore.  They may
provide certain levels of privacy, but with various levels of
protection against drugs, money laundering, etc.  Others may allow
things to slip through the cracks due to incompetence, but will
eventually shut.
A monolithic ecash system doesn't have the flexibility to allow
individual actors to change or fold without affecting the system; a
decentralized one does.  If you assume a monolithic system, a single
investigation could have some risk of shutting it down.
An ecash system is about providing a higher level of anonymity than
even the richest people in the world can have today, to every random
user connecting from home, in the normal course of operations.  And
continuing to transact business regardless of what happens.  This is
completely impossible for any kind of monolithic entity to do.
Prohibitions on anonymous financial transactions are not just some
minor law; they're not even a major law.  This is *the* regulatory
issue of the past 50-100 years.  (along with the supremacy of the
federal state).  It is bigger than the war on drugs, bigger than the
war on terrorism, etc.
An anonymous electronic cash system, in aggregate, is a direct threat
to the nation state.  That's why otherwise intelligent people have
spent nearly 20 years building systems which have this as a
pre-requisite, wasting millions of dollars in futile efforts to
develop/deploy, etc.
I still think the most likely result is that a system will be
distributed and not deployed, or deployed but not widely used, and
thus mainly ignored, but not for regulatory reasons, simply for trust,
software engineering, market, etc. reasons.  But I'd like to give it a shot.

(round 809834 because I'm sure this has been discussed 809833 times at
least on this and other lists, but google hasn't found anything
interesting for me)
(I was going to try to make a long posting on what I felt were the
good and bad of the state of play of ecash software development at the
end of 2001, but then I spent a few minutes poking through cypherpunks
archives and realized that's not much new to say which wouldn't need
to be explained in context not a lot of people have.  I'd rather spend
the time this freezing winter day developing some useful software instead.  (configuring some semi-useful software, rather, right now) So instead just a few questions.)
What exactly *is* the legal or security liability if a person of
independent/offshore means develops and delivers an electronic cash
system in an open-source fashion, optionally with no continuing
personal involvement in development, or optionally with continuing personal
software development involvement but no operational involvement?  How
much of a difference do the various levels of removal make?
(in place of "ecash" feel free to substitute "anonymization",
"datahaven", "p2p", "assassination politics bot", etc....the argument
is probably generalizable to any unpopular code which involves money
and privacy.)
I'm unconvinced it's possible to develop any large piece of software
in a truly anonymous manner; anyone who *could* develop ecash has
enough information available about them online to understand what they
did, especially for something as intellectually complex as a workable,
vs. minimum-effort, ecash system.  There is a small enough number of
people who could develop such a thing that a bit of research would
show which ones spent every day for the past 3 months shirking other
professional responsibilities and contacting credit card processors,
writing code, etc.  (plus, of course, ego reasons make it unlikely
the developers of such a thing could remain anonymous)
From nothing I've seen is the risk anywhere near as substantial as
some would suppose.  Worst case with ecash is that it is ONLY used for
criminal operations; perhaps the ecash operator could be attacked
under RICO?  I think perhaps the developer could be named if there
were more than arms-length interaction between developer and operator,
but this becomes more difficult if post-development the developer
disclaims ownership.  Lets say it is used by real terrorists to
finance the purchase of weapons for a weapon of mass destruction, in a
single transaction, with no other uses.  As long as the developer is
not linked to the operation of the system, and the operator of the
system is not linked to the end parties, I can see legal or extralegal
harassment.  (I am perhaps naively assuming US law is the only law
which matters; this may not be the case)  But what is the absolute worst thing that will happen?  Extralegal
quasi-governmental execution?  Indefinite imprisonment without trial?
Successful prosecution under some law?  Asset seizure?  Being declared
a bad person by Ashcroft in a press conference?  Not getting invited
to FBI agent parties?  Scorn and slight regard?  You can't "unwrite"
code, and if something is done and shut down, but doesn't fail for
fundamental reasons, it's just a matter of time before someone else
picks up the still-shiny unbroken tools and starts again, perhaps a
bit more carefully.  If people stopped slanging rock every time
someone on the corner got knocked, the ghetto would have a lot fewer BMWs.
The DMCA/Dmitri case is certainly one of the most recent, but the end
result was effectively nothing.  I would be annoyed by spending a year
in a federal jail, but it wouldn't seriously impact my life.  Being
convicted of a felony would be slightly more unpleasant, but not
substantially so -- not that I'm convinced there's much which would
stick.  I don't really need to worry about asset forfeiture, being
declared "evil" by Ashcroft would be worth it, and I doubt I'd get invited to FBI parties anyway.  Being murdered by the state would also
be unpleasant, but is at least fairly rare and unlikely.  A
media/government character assassination attempt would be unpleasant
as well, but would be difficult to make stick given the disrespect
large segments of society have for the government and media already.
If the risks of developing ecash really are overblown, perhaps that
will make it more likely people would actively develop software.  That
is, aside from the standard "ecash is a complex system technically", "we need money to buy aeron chairs and feed ourselves", "you need to
be able to both develop and operate a system to bootstrap, and these
are different skills", "it's easier to spend time debating why such a
system can't be done or hasn't been done than to actually develop it",
"how will anyone make money from it?", "writing code is hard, let's go
shopping", "crypto-export regulations", "many have tried, all have
failed", "the actual lack of any clear market demand for such a
system, and active opposition on many grounds by those necessary to
deploy widely", "if I wait long enough someone else will do it for me,
and I am lazy", "moral doubts about the goodness of a world with such
a system", "the patent thing", "x, y, and z will sue civilly",
"writing papers and going to conferences/grad school/etc. is more fun
than writing code", and "the fact that a lot of crypto-software
developers are even flakier than normal software developers."
(I don't think just releasing code is productive, but I think there is
a code+limited deployment which would be productive, and is not
substantially more effort.  I think there are certain technical decisions
which must be made by an ecash system with some knowledge of how
things are done in practice, but there have been ~10 attempts at
developing such things in the past, with lots of info available by
talking to the developers or being involved.  Mainly what is important
is to do as little work as possible, the ultimate goal of any software
engineer, and to make sure that as little work as possible is required
to use the system.  There are certain very minor design, API, and UI
decisions which would logically have a very large impact on user
perception (end user and developer), adoption rate, and terminal success.
I also believe in "start small and imperfect, iteratively improve in a mostly hill-climbing fashion" and some other very simple rules of [open source/internet] software development which have not been
followed by previous projects (some of which I've learned myself at
some cost).  I share the belief that a capitalized,
startup-style, large and collaborative project is entirely the wrong
way to go about things, and would not invest $1 of my own money in
such a thing, but I disagree that it requires any substantial
technical *programming* skill beyond any other moderately-complex
network + crypto programming library; mainly one needs to know how to
avoid doing work.  Since to be useful the system must be integrated
into applications, a lot of thought needs to go into how to design it
to encapsulate nastiness, and integrate with a wide variety of
The number one thing required to successfully develop and deploy an electronic cash system today, though, is being simultaneously
smart enough to be able to do it, but stupid enough to do it anyway,
even given the past failures, lack of rational economic motive, and
potential risks.  People often do irrational things; sometimes this is
constructive, other times it is not, but it's usually interesting, at
least to me.)

@_subject: Re: More on remailers 
I'm arguing that with less anonymity than the current mixmaster
network, but with greater ease of use, you could have superior
experiences.  Specifically using standard MUAs, like MS Outlook, which
include SMTP-TLS and IMAP-SSL; operate as a normal user, with the
normal MS-default MUA, connecting to a remotely maintained mailserver
which filters attachments, keeps no logs, and is optionally
implemented in tamper-resistant hardware with published code.  Located
in a jurisdiction and a network environment where, provided an AUP is
complied with, subpoenas or denial of service are at least as unlikely
as shutdown of the aggregate of most major mixmaster remailer nodes today.
"Click here for an offshore anonymous mailbox" is a lot easier than
reading even a simple description of mixmaster remailer theory.
Sheep use it in unencrypted-message, unencrypted-mailbox,
pseudonymous, linkable, communicate-via-SSL,
download-on-message-receipt mode.  Wolves can operate in a way which
is indistinguishable to casual observation, but with encrypted message
contents, and possibly with redirection via reply-blocks through
remailers, or remailed to an address through the remailer network
normally, or encrypted and deposited to a web server which also
contains mailing list archives in SSL, or to a usenet group with wide I want something *I* would use, ultimately.  I both trust myself not
to violate my own privacy, and am lazy on a day to day basis.
Oh, certainly group-mediated communication is interesting -- and the
Beale Screamer incident was one of the few highly worthwhile uses of
remailers I've seen since running one.
I'm concerned that if remailers have only a bad rep, it will be easier
to criminalize their operation, and they will be persecuted more by
network administrators (rather than operated, or at least benignly
IRC servers are already prohibited on various colo/leased circuits,
even though they're legal, due to technical and social issues..  Same
with spam.
Users won't be drawn to use technology which has a reputation of being
used primarily for harrassment; if sending an anonymous message to
someone is more likely to have it ignored or otherwise not taken
seriously than sending a non-anonymous message.  Already (from reading
abuse I've seen that a lot of abuse
addresses refuse to act based on messages sent via anonymous
remailers.  If they were instead sent through a pseudonymous system
with some accountability/linkability/cheap-way-to-do-reputation, or
indistinguishable from non-remailer mail (by hosting domains and
sending under that domain), or a 2-way system where the abuse desk
could contact the user making a complaint and interact, they'd be
taken more seriously.
I'd like anonymous email to accomplish something more than just
sending messages anonymously to one another as today; I'd like it to
serve as an example of why cryptography, anonymization, and other
techniques are things which should be widely supported.  For that to
happen, someone needs to be able to communicate why it should be used
in a convincing way to reporters, show them how to use it, and then
convince the mass-market that participating in some way is something
they should be doing.  "If you support freedom of speech, send
anonymous email through mixmaster remailers" is less likely to work
than "if you support freedom of speech, make sure your ISP supports
"secure (ssl) mail" and click the "use SSL" option in your copy of MS Outlook.  SSL for http has done a good thing by getting people to
associate crypto and (financial) privacy and security; pushing SSL
email could do the same thing for privacy.
Recent hassle over 802.11b encryption, open networks, etc. is perhaps
an inspiring sign -- once it became widely reported (due initially to
pete shipley coming up with a cute name for something he was doing, I
think), it became "the cool thing" to use encryption on your 802.11b
network; the WEP break notwithstanding, people went from using no
crypto to lame-but-better-than-nothing crypto in larger numbers per
unit time than I've seen before.
I don't really care about privacy for random stupid people as an end
in itself, but I need the cover traffic.  Rather than making people
smarter, I'd rather make the crypto stupider, or at least easier to
use poorly.
(when ecash happens, this will be even more important, but luckily
paying people anonymously and doing unobservable finance is a
compelling end-user application, given a good ui)
Oh, I certainly agree on this -- I'd love to see a great p2p system
which protected privacy while moving *large* files (upper bound, say
1GB DivX movies).  Trading pr0n warez DivX is a compelling end-user
app.  Yet, for these, latency *is not* as serious a concern as human
interaction.  If I were designing the ultimate p2p system, I'd do:
[note: this is a 6 paragraph digression from the topic at hand]
* Small fast 2-way anonymous interactive network for sending control
information...maybe the lower bound is being able to do 100bps
constant-rate to the cloud of actual information, constantly send
dummy traffic.
* Searches which operate remotely, so you don't need to download index
info from every server, just results
* High-bandwidth, async, high-latency transport for sending files.
Maybe multicast, using a multicast transport.  I can do VSAT in US/EU
for something like USD 3k/month to broadcast 34Mbps...you could
broadcast a stream of random encrypted data and then distribute keys separately after the file is distributed widely.  (it's called
"Usenet", and there are a bunch of VSAT-based usenet delivery
services, a friend of mine used to run one).  Just auto-couriering
stuff onto rooted servers and publishing the URL over the 2-way
anonymous network is probably fine, if the end-user's anonymity is not * The ability to do something like say "I want all kiddie porn
featuring anal penetration of older than 3 but younger than 6, wearing
red t-shirts" and have these files appear over the next 6 months -- "subscribe" to a search, vs. doing a search repeatedly.  (Ideally
you'd request files in a way where you offer ecash for them...if I
want a CD, I might be willing to pay enough to make it worthwhile for
someone to purchase, encode, and upload it, then recursive auctions
and all that...)
(all of these concepts have been discussed or used in various p2p
systems...I only mention them as a way to avoid the necessity for a
low-latency, high-bandwidth, high-anonymity channel for every single
user of a file sharing system)
[end digression]
I think "email", which I take to mean "15 second to 5 day latency,
under 40KB, armored text unidirectional messaging with rfc822 headers
prepended, no return receipts or delivery confirmation, best effort,
store and forward, delivery-time-uncertain" is a pretty general
technology.  Unless you're concerned about reliable delivery and
receipts, or substantially deviating from anonymous-mix-email's
latency/bandwidth regime, I don't see much point in doing anything but
email.  MTAs don't suck that much these days -- postfix is a lot
better at what it does, specifically, than any "cypherpunk" I've ever seen.
Building a tolerable p2p system which used *just* mixmaster and rooted
cablemodem-hosted boxes would be entirely possible, but pretty boring.
Pipenet is very interesting; I'd certainly run few 10Mbps nodes for
experimental value.   But it would be hard to do cost-recovery on a
pipenet except for small (control?) data, or multicast.  Until the
risks of being identified as an end-user in the warez game are
increased to criminal, and the profusion of easily-routed throwaway
servers dries up (hah), there won't be a way to charge enough to make
it worthwhile for unicast media object transport.  Realtime chat,
though, would be a killer app for pipenet -- fairly multicast, low
bitrate, 512Kbps DSL users could be first-class nodes, "legally
compelling" (it's user to user human speech, so courts are less likely
to be able to categorically hate on it enough to shut down nodes),
lots of users (I'm sure you could get 100k users for the new cool kids
IRC replacement, with end to end security, on the fly group creation,
less key management/channel management issues than irc, group chat,
good clients, ease of installation, etc. with no trouble, and maybe a
few million users over time.  Add some bots, which can migrate, and it
starts to be really interesting.)
I'd always assumed all nodes on a pipenet were first-class; if you're
talking about a pipenet with leaves, then yeah, you'd want a
constant-bitrate channel in.
Raph was disliking gale's lack of anonymity; anonymous realtime
human-human and group messaging is probably more reasonable than I
thought at the time.
The unimplemented but academically-interesting alternate mixes
proposed would maybe be just as good as a pipenet; ideally you'd be
deploying all of these in a framework which allowed different
transports, but provided common keying, addressing, and external API.
Maybe I've contradicted my earlier argument against interesting new
p2p software -- I think for "bread and butter" secure *email* you
might as well use a decent SSL mail server with optional ubobservable
I/O instead of mixmaster, but for something closer to chat, the new stuff might be interesting.  Mixmaster is in the middle ground between the two; it should go to one side of the road or the other.
If you're doing an ecash system which has >8KB/message and more than,
say, 5 exchanges per transaction, you're doing something wrong.  And
the aforementioned latency/anonymity slider is just as easy to shift
on an SMTP based system as on any other protocol as transport.  You
need protocol-specific cryptographic receipts as part of the protocol
anyway (which various values serve as), so really you could just use
[encrypted-payload] UDP [multicast], but whatever.
I think ecash will ultimately have many transports, but one of them
should almost certainly be PGP-encrypted email which looks exactly
like any other PGP-encrypted message, back and forth with an ecash
server attached directly to a remailer, where every message fits
within the remailer standard mail sizing.
The pipenet/chatnet solution would probably be suitable for ecash
protocol communications as well.

Quoting Steve Schear :
[admittedly, I'm very biased, since I have more of a network engineering/admin

I'm wary of doing things which violate internet standards and generally
complicate application design to support:
1) Windows users trying to run servers
2) People running reliable servers on filtered networks (just get a tunnel
if you really care)
I don't see there being a huge need for middleman/remix-only nodes.  There is a huge need for well-configured, production-grade exit hosts with testicular fortitude and a bad attitude.  Are there *any* documented cases of people subpoenaing more than one layer deep in a remailer net?  Or even actively
fucking with a single remailer who simply says "I keep no logs" successfully
enough to do any more than shut him down? (mixmaster, not penet)
Things like the hotmail exit code are foiled these days by the "prove you are a real human or a turing-test-complete AI to open an account"
Relying on services which are in violation of terms of service (running a remailing server on a consumer dialup or cablemodem with a no-servers
policy, abusing stupid web email providers to take the heat) is not a good way for high-visibility, high-abuse postions of the network to operate, if reliability is key (as it is for non-abusive remailer users).
Until there is evidence otherwise, I think 5-10 well-administered, professionally maintained remailers, run by reasonably well known
organizations, with sufficient legal firepower to defend themselves,
running a codebase which is as reliable as a standard MTA, with best-efforts
spam and abuse prevention, would provide a better service to users than 100
99% reliable remailers running on cablemodems which can be incapacitated
by a single email to noc or blown power supply or whatever.  Simultaneously raise the bar in some ways (require better network, maintenance, etc.) but lower it in the ways which influence TCO for a professional organization (install and maintenance admin time).
Provide a way to inject messages into the system without identifying the
user as "member of the set of remailer users"; put up a web interface
accessible via a quality anonymizing proxy, or pick up encrypted messages
from USENET, or encourage dummy traffic from end users (put a nice web anonymizer and/or SSL web server with general-interest content right next
to the remailer, ideally, for plausible deniability, and use JS or java or something so normal browsing sessions and remailer-interaction sessions are
Given the level of latency and standard deviation for messages, I'm not
sure if this would provide a reasonable level of quality of service, using
today's remailer population.

@_subject: Re: Pay per use remailers and remailer reliability tracking. 
As much as I love the idea of using electronic cash for remailers,
given the current state of things, I think it's not the first thing
which should be done for remailers.
1) We don't yet *have* an electronic cash system with sufficient volume to
cover this -- you'd want a general-use electronic cash system where
purposes like this were a small part, otherwise the billing records
show all remailer users.  (unless you used a system like hashcash,
which will eliminate spam, but not compensate remailer operators)
2) Remailed messages would fall into the "millicent ghetto" -- how
much do you think messages will cost?  If the goal is ecash, why not
focus on higher-value but clear market-demand apps?  If the goal is
improving remailers, there are some other things which can be done
first (and which are essential steps to an ecash based remailer
anyway).  If the goal is actually ecash-based remailers just as a cool
thing, then please do the other fixes first anyway :)
3) Ease of use -- it's hard enough to run mixmaster already.  The low
hanging fruit would be in automating key management, packaging *well*
for debian, redhat, etc., and fixing a bunch of the random bugs in
mixmaster which cause it to blow up on certain From: addresses.  If it
were possible to run mixmaster 3 with *no* real user intervention (no
need to subscribe to flamey mailing lists, no need to manually fuck
with people who change keys, no need to watch a list to edit people's
capstrings, etc. -- then more people would run remailers.
This goes double for clients.  In the case of remailers, increasing
volume *does* enhance privacy; if we didn't care about volume, we'd
just use a bunch of rooted boxes through netcafes to send high-value
anonymous messages...remailers are only useful with volume, and
legitimate applications make them easier to defend.
There's certainly a need to compensate remailer operators, but the
$10/month or so a remailer network would likely provide through ecash
is probably not the way to do it.  What does it cost to run a
* A box (pretty low spec; mine is a 533Mhz celeron and does other
  stuff too, and has never had a problem)
* Reasonable network connectivity (56Kbps fulltime, DSL,
  leased...maybe moving on to DSL or leased at a minimum for
  interesting stuff)
* Some level of agility or fault-tolerance on the link, so you can
  operate in the face of complaints
* A "fuck the law" attitude (.45s or J.D. optional)
What do remailer operators want:
* Ego boost
* "Doing something cool"
* Social respect from peers.
* Low overhead and hassle
* Entertainment (I *love* reading abuse
* Personal use of remailer for nefarious purposes (freedom of anonymity only
  truly belongs to he who owns the anonymizer)
I think the best way to get remailers widely deployed is:
1) Create a version of mixmaster which is much more self-running, at
least on UNIX, OSX, and cygwin, and allows cpunks, mixmaster, and
maybe future constant-rate or stego or other interesting transports as
plugins -- make keying be a policy decision but with the code smart
enough to handle updates within authority delegated to it by the
2) Make it easy to install a remailer; "apt-get install mixmaster" and
maybe a few questions, all of which should have sensible defaults, so
you can just hold down return and get a working, productive (if not
optimal) remailer.
3) Promote the remailer and applications which make use of the
remailer (there's nothing I've seen, other than pingers and remailer
infrastructure, which uses remailers programmatically in some cool
way.  Some kind of ok-with-high-latency application -- ecash tunneled
through remailers?  Another blacknet test?  An anonymous-only message
board?  Web publishing?  Whatever.
4) Some kind of internal or external benefits to remailer operators.
Something along the lines of "I will throw a party at DefCon with free
(heh) ---- and -----s for the first 20 people who can prove control of
mixmaster remailer keys which transit test messages I send throughout
the year (selected based on normal client criteria, such as uptime,
latency, etc.)".  Someone could presumably donate money in a similar
fashion.  This would provide some level of decoupling from "bank
accounts of those who sponsor remailers" and "remailer users".
("convince legions of 18-25 year old females that remailer operators
are the best in bed" would be ideal, but is probably not going to happen)
5) Get more companies, universities, and non-profits to run remailers,
as they have machines, relatively untouchable network feeds.  Why is
there no EFF remailer?  Why is there no ACLU remailer?  Why is there
no ZKS remailer?  I mainly started the havenco remailer for social
and intellectual purposes, but there are slight marketing benefits to
it as well.  I'm sure people (me.  you?) would be willing to provide
time to help worthwhile organizations set up remailers.  Back in the
day big companies would run public ftp sites for the common good; I
think any organization dealing with any volume of mail today should
feel socially pressured to run a remailer.
6) Deal with the spam issue -- integrate something like nilsima into
mixmaster directly, none of this procmail hackery (which I haven't
bothered to configure myself).  This would eliminate "whitelists" and
other cruft which decrease the reliability of the remailer network
substantially.  Doesn't stop mailing list or newsgroup spam, but it's
fucking 2001 (almost 2002) -- if you care that much about the 0.1
seconds of time to delete a piece of spam, your list should be
filtered, moderated, or posting limited to subscribers only.
7) Provide a UI which doesn't suck for users -- including better
web-based interfaces (perhaps as part of the base distribution?) with
anti-spam measures (mixmaster+nilsima may be enough, but "copy this
image number down" might be needed.
8) Some kind of two-way communications -- which I will happily host,
as I'm sure others will as well -- providing remailer-accessed
mailboxes, return addresses, etc.  Less private, more linkable, but
still pretty anonymous, as you could require all the messages to be encrypted (or not), and the initial user-to-mailbox delivery is
reliable; even if the remailer network is unreliable, you could do
return receipts with your own client such that it will retransmit
through the chain of remailers a couple times if need be, until you
can guarantee receipt, before deleting from the server.  Most of the
"antisocial" remailer-facilitated activities are hit-and-run; most of
the *good* remailer uses require a persistent identity and two-way communications.  (and, paying for a real mailbox is something which is
not in the millicent ghetto; $20/year for a mailbox is entirely
common, and people might be willing to pay a substantial premium for So, while I'd really like to see ecash, I think remailers need some
other work first, before they could really benefit from the effort
required to create an ecash system from scratch, deploy it, scale it,
and then use it for this application.  Not that I'm saying an ecash
system isn't worthwhile for its own sake, though :)

@_subject: Re: Liability, economic realities and self delusion in ecash 
Quoting Black Unicorn :
I was trying to distinguish involvement as an officer in a development
company vs. a deployment company, but yes.
I am not as interested in the risks to a monolithic electronic cash
system, holding accounts at Bank of New York and a few others,
developed internally, where all user funds are pooled, but rather the
most distributed system feasible.  While the only way I can see to get
a system deployed is for a single organization to develop software,
and another or the same to operate or contract for the threshold
number of services required to provide a decent end-user experience,
the system could easily metastasize and decentralize when required.
This has been the case with several fielded payment systems already.
[based on the Ian Grigg 5-part model from FC99, Ian
Goldberg/etc. change-maker model, and general best practice for ecash
in 2001:]
1) a market which holds no physical assets, trading as a piece of software
Since this component has no physical assets, it would seem only a
technical challenge to keep it operating in the face of attack.
2) software developers developing code to a published specification,
such that end-users can develop their own software, or select from
competing vendors.
This would allow some of the more "research"
aspects to be undertaken by developers arms-length or more from those
providing customization work to potentially at-risk clients.  Open
source and network software has many precedents here; gaming software
in particular, given the US legal situation and tinges of money
laundering risk.
3) issuers
Aside from traditional forms of risk, issuers could differentiate
themselves based on regulatory compliance or regulatory risk.
Conceivably, entirely underground currencies (the "gold-denominated,
opium-backed burmese opium futures" of yore) could operate,
maintaining backing in effectively There is little or no reason for the issuers to have any contact with
the developers, or with the market, or indeed even with end users --
only with (possibly anonymized and/or arms-length) the change-makers,
or with server operators (again, possibly nothing but arms-length)
4) operators of servers
A reasonable electronic cash system would be turnkey, at least at the
scales likely initially.  The only transactions a mint should do can
be enumerated in a 1-page API.  Integration with existing back-office
banking systems, external payment systems, etc.  is complex, but not
necessary with the change-maker optimization.  Assuming ultimate
liability held by a single individual per currency, with only very
large and infrequent transactions between backing store for currency,
and bulk sales to change-makers, most of the access control or automated
transactions can be deferred; a simple authentication and direct
(logged) double-entry modification of values is enough.
These parties would not need to hold any financial assets other than
those required to maintain servers.  One could further refine to
"colocation provider" who sells a server, and a "systems operator"
who, fully anonymously, installs and operates electronic cash software
on those servers, connecting via anonymized ssh, paying for physical
services in cash, etc.
5) [optional] holders of backing assets for issuers
In the case of unlimited-liability by an issuer, the need for an
external party to hold assets for the issuer is reduced.  If the rate
of transactions is reduced sufficiently, ease of holding large assets
without risk
(the trivial case is Cryptonomicon-style direct holding of large
physical assets; for development purposes, I could easily hold up to
USD 10m-50m in physical assets in a spare machine room without substantial upgrades to security...2-3 day latency, or issuance against personal
liability, or issuance against large physical assets.)
For reasons of auditiability, it is of course desirable to separate
the trustee of such assets from the other parties, but this is just an optimization (which would decrease the discount at which an issue may
trade; do it when the cost is exceeded by the benefit)
6) end-users
This is perhaps the most complex issue, and probably worthy of a
separate discussion.  This is one area I think most ecash systems have
failed at.  You propose using banks themselves as customers; perhaps
this is interesting, but I'm not convinced they would adopt a system
in a realtime timeframe.  I'd love to be proven wrong.
I know of several legitimate applications which have market demands
for certain restricted forms of electronic cash which would be early
adopters, provided certain performance and reliability specs were met,
with a certain degree of end-user usability.  All of which could be
achieved by the proposed system in a very early stage.
7) "change makers"
Participants who hold one or more forms of electronic cash, operating as
banks, corporations, or informal traders, and can exchange electronic
cash for something of value, and optionally vice versa, with at least
some subset of users.  These could easily be arms length from everyone
else, evanescent, and the collapse of one would have no serious consequences.
I assume the electronic cash system, as the law is written today,
WOULD be sufficient to serve as a "firewall" between change-makers
handling the same currencies, and certainly against change-makers
handling diverse currencies.  This is the  question I have.  If this
is the case, then I think an electronic cash system is completely
viable even post 2001-09-11.  As long as shutting down one change
maker's bank accounts would not affect other change makers, a system
could withstand most of the "obvious" attacks.
8) supporting services
Ratings services, tickers, derivative instruments, consulting for
merchants, etc. are all services which could be done easily by arms
length entities.
I am suggesting a distributed system where each participant is
expendable is far better from a deployment standpoint than a
monolithic system.
I am suggesting that for development purposes, a small, grassroots
organization *is* vastly superior to a larger one.
I think a large bank's protections would rapidly boil away in the heat
if they intentionally developed or deployed a system designed to go
against the anti-privacy trend of the past 50 years.  But of course
they have no incentive to do so in the first place.
I'm willing to accept that a change maker could be shut down easily if
it were used for an unpopular purpose.  The other participants would
seem much more difficult to attack.  And provided attacking one does
not automatically take down other unrelated competitors at the same
level, it shouldn't affect the whole system; the system will build in
discounts based on risk.
The only real risk is if the *demand* for financial privacy decreases,
not if the cost to provide financial privacy increases.  Perhaps if
cost is driven past what customers are willing to pay for widespread
applications, but I think there are enough high-value applications in
the underground economy to support even a relatively expensive system.
And if a given hawala trader is shut down, but cannot identify other
hawala traders, except that they all use torn federal reserve notes as
tokens, no action will be taken against the fed; others hawala traders
will raise their rates to compensate, if risk is judged to be higher.
This is the only area where I disagree substantially; I think a system
could easily be developed such that initial developers were not
necessary to continuing maintenance, implementation, security, etc.
With a reasonable degree of initial effort, and a background in
easily-modified open source development, at least.  This
does make it much more difficult for ecash developers to extract
revenue from sale of software, which is why it hasn't been done in the
past, but perhaps this is one of the many cases where it's far easier
to accomplish something if you don't care about who gets the credit or
benefit for it.
Certainly arrest or questioning could be used as a harassment tactic,
but I don't see much potential for successful prosecution here.  Both
are bad, but conviction is worse.
Certainly a developer in this case has every incentive to publish
*every* known vulnerability immediately, simply to avoid this kind of
pressure.  Perhaps this would be an interesting general security
principle for full disclosure -- full disclosure to prevent being Assuming arrest or questioning regardless, I don't see how the
probability of conviction on felony charges for simply writing
software to do bits is high enough to change anyone's actions.
Seizure of assets, arrest, etc. would definitely be enough to deter many people.
I think this is a risk/reward/accessibility thing.
If each component of a system is broken down into individual
components with some legal protection between layers, it's much
Anyone who could implement all of the pieces and operate them all is a
very small set.  These people would most likely face substantial risks
(if they break any law in the process, they could be convicted; and
simply an attempt at prosecution or even a civil lawsuit could be
crippling), and there would be little incentive for them to do so.
However, if each component is analyzed separately, it opens up a much
larger set of potential participants, and the risk/reward profile of
each is better.  Software development is about as risk free as
anything in the system; the reward is perhaps lower, but the level of
skill is relatively high compared to some of the operational actors, so that
increases the likely reward.
The highest risk components are also the least skill-intensive, and
could have effectively unbounded rewards (set by the market and
competition).  This is as it should be.  In drugs, high profits belong
to those who control monopoly assets, have large amounts of capital,
etc. ("high 'skill'"), and they are relatively low risk.  Highest
risks probably belong to individual street workers or couriers, which
are very low skill, but moderately high reward, depending on risk.
Conviction, yes.  But you've not shown how software developers, or
indeed most of the participants, would be subject to anything but
civil or criminal-harassment, and it appears the balance of evidence
is that those who just develop software are unlikely to be convicted.
I personally would be far more unhappy with being arrested and
convicted immediately for 1 year, than arrested, held without trial or
conviction for 2 years, and then released.  This is why developing
software or hardware is more attractive to me than couriering drugs or money.
Hah :)  "Hacker" is rather limiting.  Electronic cash, if it enhances
the underground economy, is far more meaningful politically than any
non-economic online activity like trading files. Of course, success in
this  is directly related to unpopularity with the government.
I believe there are some applications for electronic cash which, if it
met certain minimal standards, would be sufficient to make it
self-supporting.  These applications are relatively free adopters of
new technologies, especially compared to financial institutions.
Gaming and pornography would be highly suitable, given recent actions
by credit card issuers, complete security failures by ccbill and
others, inherently high fraud rates, etc.
I don't think anyone has seriously proposed ecash as a retail
widespread purchasing system to compete with credit cards since the
mid 1980s.
Applications in equity markets are also interesting.  Micropayments
seem to be a waste of time, although there are some applications for
which they might be suitable (specifically, the "electronic postage
paid to recipient of email to read it, as a bond against spam" is one
of the most interesting ideas I've seen, and given the right software
and UI, could actually be interesting and worthwhile...I would put 2-3
months into it if there were a pre-existing electronic cash system to There are numerous underground economy applications which are
interesting from both a market sense and a political one.
Indeed, code or protocol re-use, elimination of complexity, etc. are
good for all software projects, especially "cypherpunk" ones.
This is a very very good point.
I am proposing separating pieces of a fielded system such that each
can have its own secrecy/limited liability profile (assuming they all
want to be successful).  Issuers, perhaps, can be of both kinds.
Software developers are, for the most part, non-secret, but limited
liability.  Change-makers can, through technical restraint, be
completely "open" in certain ways -- to make it clear that they must
make good on transactions -- and completely secret in others.
Markets, operators, etc. are fairly impotent to do anything outside
very limited technical tasks, which should be widely publicized.
I would argue that technical "code-based prohibition preemptively,
vs. prosecution after the fact", or "code not laws" is about the same
as "limited liability vs. secrecy" -- after all, isn't removal of
ability to do something a traditional way to reduce liability, as an The reason I'd be unwilling to invest any money (but not necessarily
time or other resources) into an ecash software development effort is
the "moral hazard" of externally-funded startups, as .  Perhaps it's
that I've seen some of the worst of the dotcom boom from California
and am still reacting to it.
I think the only productive ways to introduce external capital to
electronic cash would be:
* Providing non-divertable resources (computer time, office space,
etc.) to development efforts, perhaps based on progress.  While I
think 20 people making $200k/year in a luxury office in San Francisco
could easily waste $15m furnishing an office (12 Entrepreneuring...),
there are only so many cheap laptops, dormitory-grade accomodations,
and rackmounted servers you can use to enhance your quality of life; 1
Bentley is worth more than 80 Cutlasses.  If the funds
go to actual tools for the development of software, and are meager
enough to not be a desirable end in themselves, a lot of the apathy
hazard disappears.  Of course, the resources needed to develop this
are exceedingly modest.  It's easier for me to divert some of the
capital and facilities I have now to work on projects such as this
than to do anything else; office space, hardware, accomodations,
servers, etc. in the north sea cost me effectively nothing for even a moderately-sized development effort.  (until maybe September 2001,
though, my time has been very limited)
* Providing financial rewards based on public accomplishment of
milestones.  If there were funds which would be paid based on
"electronic cash included by default with shipping versions of MS IE",
only successful efforts would raise money.  I can put some money
toward this if anyone else wants to develop a system (although
specifying the winning conditions is complex).  Of course this does possibly put the funds of those providing the prize at risk.
One reason why I'd be reluctant to do this (plus that if I did it, it
would be on the scale of thousands or tens of thousands, which is
perhaps not sufficient motivation for anyone), is that "task market"
systems have all failed in the past.  This is different in that it is
more a "bounty" a la lindbergh or x-prize, vs. a generalized system.
However, coming up with a good external specification and judging for
this is more complex than the conditions for either of these
aeronautical feats.
* Ensure that once a system is developed, it can actually be deployed;
I'm sure amateur development efforts in ecash would have gone ahead
long ago if developers had not been concerned with deployment, legal
issues, etc.  If it were *just* a software development effort with a
defined deliverable, it's interesting to people with a different
risk/reward/skill profile than "develop this and maybe it will get
deployed, maybe it will be shut down by patents, maybe it will be shut
down by the authorities, maybe it will be used by enough users, maybe
you will get some reward."
The tools that exist today are beyond the ability of those with the
risk/reward/skill profile to be willing to use them to be able to use them.
Thus, there is no ecash deployed.  If ecash could be reduced to a
"push this button" level of skill, I believe at least one of each
necessary actor would find it within his risk/reward profile to
operate.  I certainly find it within my risk/reward profile do any but
not necessarily all of hosting ecash servers for others, run a trial currency as an issuer, participating as a user, operating a limited
market, and perhaps even acting as a change maker on an informal
basis. (but doing all of these is obviously poor).
Well, in the split system, I think "writing code for entertainment
value only" could easily be sufficiently high motivation for one of
the many people who can develop such software to do so.  Certainly, it
has been in the past, for Pr0duct Cypher and others.  I believe if the
problem were reduced to *strictly* a "write code" one, ecash could be
developed as easily as any other fairly complex network/cryptographic
system which touches on finance -- more difficult, surely, than ssleay
or , but less difficult than an ERP system, and probably less complex
than NCSA Mosaic (given the right background).
Very few people participate in high-risk activities, even low
skill/capital ones, without being paid -- almost every drug dealer I
know is in it for financial reward (with some lsd/e/hallucinogen
dealers perhaps being more interested in political or social change).
In the system I propose, the high risk components are competitive and
compensated, other components are low risk with acceptable reward and
relatively low skill, but there unfortunately remain some low-risk,
high-skill, uncertain reward components, most specifically initial
development and stage-0 deployment of test systems.
The only motivation I can see which will actually be sufficient for
ecash software to be developed is if the developers find the exercise itself intellectually rewarding, and the potential consequences
worthwhile.  Ecash development is not a *rational* economic choice, at
least in terns of short term rewards.
Throwing money or toys at the problem is not going to
change this, as I may be overly cynical, but I think the probability
of a product goes down proportionate to the amount of money invested
over the bare minimum necessary; and for ecash that is $0.  (perhaps
the corollary is that those who could most easily develop ecash at
this point have "lack of ecash" costs as a substantial existing item,
and thus *could* spend up to that amount to develop it without causing
negative feedback; but this is a pretty tortured argument, there are
agency problems, etc.  Although, I suppose the cost to me personally
of not having ecash is in excess of USD 500k, in that havenco can
really only go public on an ecash-based market, and I can only easily
realize value from my equity through such an offering, discounted of
course for ecash deployment costs, risk, forgone value from private
sale, etc.)
If the probability of any individual developer finding
this to be sufficient reward is too low for one's taste, one should
attempt to increase the set of efforts which could possibly develop
the software.  Perhaps the dotcom collapse, by putting a lot of people
back onto the job market with uncertain prospects, will increase this
set; perhaps better programming environments which lower the skill
required to do cryptographic and network programming will do it;
perhaps the expiration of patents and dying down of patriotic hysteria
will reassure developers; perhaps legal analysis of the risks to pure
developers will lower it; perhaps high visibility persecution of p2p
systems, dmca-violating tools, etc. will motivate a new generation of
programmers; perhaps computer science education will improve.
(I personally find working on such software very interesting and
rewarding, even if it is destined to do nothing more than be a
published, working, but unused curiosity, but despite this, external circumstances have caused me to focus on "my real job" for much of the past year.  I'm quite happy to spend some of my spare time working on
such a system, and hope this spare time increases in the future, but I think there are some other, smaller, more easily accomplished and
deployed systems which I will release first -- mail and associated
utilities, perhaps a simple proxy, productization of some internal
management and automation tools, and thus the process will be a bit
slower than it could be.  If someone else were to develop a suitable
system first, it would save me quite a bit of effort, obviously, and I
could contribute what I have so far, but I'm not exactly holding my breath for this.)

@_subject: Re: simplest possible ecash mint 
I don't believe "normal users" should ever interact directly with the
mint; using the mint as a reissue server only in normal operation is a
key optimization -- especially when coupled with tamper-resistant mint hardware.  Easier to develop, easier to operate, easier to audit.
Users should purchase cash from change makers; the issuer could also
operate a change maker, and can handle sales to change-makers separately.
The mint should be able to report to the world exactly how many coins
it has issued -- for without this figure, it would be difficult for
users to trust that an issuer has not inflated the currency (I think
free banking theory would disagree with this, proposing instead that
competitors attempt to test withdrawals regularly, but I still think
publishing a float figure is important).  This also demands that
certain keys be generated on the mint and only under the mint's
control, not under even the issuer's control, except through logged
and proscribed actions.
I simply want there to be a way for the issuer of a currency to
increase the authorized amount and withdraw the tokens, in a way which
is logged by the mint itself.  Otherwise, you need an external means
of generating the initial batch of signed currency, the problem with
currency withering away over time, etc.  Much better to make it a
clean part of the design.
The issuer of the currency would be able to increase or decrease the
authorized amount of cash (treasury), and could request from the mint an amount of tokens up to that amount.  The issuer could also send coins and
have them destroyed, and they would be subtracted from float.
The reason for doing this explicitly is that in the future one may
replace "issuer manually sets the treasury" with
"mint directly contacts an external server to see account balance,
publishing that as treasury", with rules internal to the mint on how
much of various assets must be held to issue a currency -- perhaps you
could have a derivative instrument issued against another token-based
currency, where the mint itself held a single large coin in another
issue.  If you made it a single step (increase treasury directly
results in increase in float, by sending coins to the treasury) it
would make automatic/external changes to the treasury more difficult,
due to the need for a multi-stage blinding protocol.
A multi-currency mint would just have multiple accounts of this form,
two for each currency, plus associated keys.  This makes it very easy
to separate mint-operator from currency issuer, etc.
I'd like there to be a way for a textual description of the issue, the
issuer signing keys, and external means of reputation/identity to be
verified; this is just a question of what keys sign what and how to
present it.

@_subject: simplest possible ecash mint 
Actually, I think to be practical you want something only
slightly more complex; 3x as much work, but 100x as useful.
Implemented in tamper-resistant hardware (a dedicated box or process
could substitute, but hardware is easier, and I have plenty):
stage 1:
* Some protocol for external communication (direct sockets is easiest,
  but message-based protocols are far better, and allow a front end
  processor to handle communications details)
* Reissue operation (powers of two coins; so you can pay with 1 x 2 coin
  and get 2 x 1 coins back)
* A clock (decent rate RNG or PRNG is useful too, obviously)
* A double spending database maintained internally
* Two account counters maintained internally: treasury and float
* "Signed float": tell anyone who asks exactly how much has been
   issued, signed as the mint.
* A means of increasing or decreasing the treasury value, after
  authentication, and ideally an internal log of these changes (which
  could be published as well, signed)
* Key management functionality (signing keys generated onboard; some
  kind of hierarchy so non-coins can be linked to coins)
* Ability to publish a description of some sort of the coins
* Power switch
This is great for a single currency on a single mint managed by a
single person.  There are several other refinements which can be added
over time which are meaningful:
* Seamlessly supporting multiple currencies on a single issuer, with
separate keys and managers
* Replication/distribution, for reliability and performance (obvious * Means of programmatically linking treasury and float -- the box
opens its own remote account of some sort, or holds other electronic
instruments, and issues only up to that amount.
* Multi-user management interface to the mint, so a large company can
authorize a day manager to make small transactions, larger changes
requiring seniority or multiple users.
* Backup/recovery methods
* Scheduled key rollovers
* Misc. transports (handled by a front end processor and load
balancer; initially I'm using sockets, but I want to use email before releasing stage 1)
There really is NOT a huge amount of complexity.  I've done 3 separate
"stage 1" systems to about 80%, but using the chaum protocol.  To be
interesting, you would probably want agility on the underlying
cryptographic basis, including brands, wagner, chaum, client-side
blinding variants, unblinded when there are no variants, trivial
non-blinded non-crypto, and any other systems.
Writing a mint to stage 1 is maybe a month worth of work.  The
complexity is in developing a client library, library API, UI, and
integration into applications.
The easiest way I see to solve that is something I call a "hosted
wallet" -- a multiuser wallet, communicating with the user over SSL,
and using the ecash protocols to interact with the mint.  Any user
*could* run a hosted wallet server, but there is no client software
which MUST be installed.  Thus satisfying both security and ease of
use.  This is also vastly easier to develop than a client-side wallet,
at least for me -- html UI, much much easier than any of the unix or
windows widget sets, inherently crossplatform, etc.
I hope to have a mint and a wallet to demo at codecon in mid-feb in
sf, stage 1.  (which is why it was scheduled then, anyway)
I need about 60-120 more hours of actual productive work
to do so. (I'd like to have at least two ecash protocols implemented,
although at present I have "non-blinded dumb tokens" for testing, and
some non-integrated blinded code)
Ideally, I'd like it to be as easy to use as web-based mail; indeed,
integrating into a web-based mail UI might make sense for some demo
person to person payments.
This is really useful for absolutely nothing but testing.  All
practical applications require a much greater level of integration
with clients.  All interesting applications require multiple
currencies and a market.  Any level of interest at all from the public
will require an easy way to buy into the system using one or more
existing payment methods, which is something I've looked into with
high priority for the past 3 months, primarily from a gaming
background, but there's nothing to prevent people from playing with
the system itself before then.  Might as well start from day 1 with
real separation of roles, at least in name.

now until september...)

@_subject: Remailer Stats (was: Swiss Bank in a Box) 
I just did some statistical analysis on a logfile accidentally kept by
an MTA which I didn't know was keeping it a few months ago.
(which I've deleted, and made sure is not being kept anymore)
Remailer traffic: approximately 3000-5000 messages/day (mix II + cpunk)
Unique input addresses over 13 days: 539 (which would include case
variations, aliases, etc.)
This is *not* statistically significant.  At the time the stats were
taken, HavenCo was a new remailer.  Also, if *I* were an end-user
using remailers, I would use havenco as an *exit* remailer, not an
entry remailer, since it is topologically close to no one; one would
wish to get the message into the remailer network as soon as
possible.  HavenCo only has, say, 3000 active tcp sessions at any one
time in or out of the facility, so if someone were monitoring, that's
a small set too.
A completely out of ass argument is that this points to a stable
remailer-user population of 1-10k users, with <1% responsible for most
of the traffic (web-based gateways, pingers, spammers, people using scripts to send abuse messages)
IMO most "real" remailer users are actually using web-based gateways,
rather than initial SMTP, to enter the network.  So these stats are
utterly flawed anyway.
A population of even 10k is certainly well within FBI (or even my
personal) resources to investigate, at least to a cursory level.
Given that most likely a lot of those users are located at large and
"compliant" ISPs or mail providers, gaining access to their normal
outgoing mail feed, connection logs, and identity information is just
not that hard.  Especially if you're willing to break the law.
So, I'd estimate the cost to recover the *average* remailer user's
identity at < USD 500 (assuming repeated use).  Monitor the ~15 big
remailers (knocking the ones off which you can't monitor, either
through legal or covert technical means...spamming via them as exit
and complaining to isp might be good enough).  You should be able to
get samples of mail from the same users without much difficulty,
monitoring their non-remailed communications at the originating ISP.
Presumably, the users may be sending some volume of related traffic
via non-remailers; this may be sufficient (could "used an evil
anonymous remailer" be sufficient to get wiretap authority on regular
mail in a terrorist case?)  Traffic analysis is *hard* to defeat.  Especially when your set is
small enough that you can do out of band analysis on all the participants.
If ZKS had, as some were saying, <500 customers for the freedom
product, it would have been even worse for them.  With a small enough
number of customers, you can blackbag users, intimidate, or whatever.
I think unless there is a compelling [non-privacy reason] for end-users
to participate in a mix, it's hopeless to try for >10k users.  If
participation in a mix were incidental to some other activity, such as
posting normal text postings to usenet, browsing a very popular
website which happens to use padded SSL for all communications, using
an encrypted IM system which did a mix of some kind as an automatic
part of operation, or participated in a large-scale p2p system.  I
think if participation in a mix is incidental to *normal* email use,
that would be sufficient as well.
I think there are a few possible routes to doing this:
0) Cypherpunk applications continuing to be few and far between, not
up to "commercial" standards, and not widely deployed.  The default.
1) Cypherpunks writing widely-used applications: this has been tried
in the past and seems to fail.  Few developers of widely-deployed
commercial software are explicitly cypherpunks, even though they may
be libertarians.  They often don't understand crypto at any deep
level, at BEST they use a pre-packed crypto library like OpenSSL if it
is a mostly drop-in replacement for a non-crypto counterpart, or
otherwise widely documented.  Witness the large number of conventional
security weaknesses in applications today, failure to manage keys
properly in the few crypto applications, etc.
2) Cypherpunks modifying existing open-source applications to
incorporate crypto.  Despite the open source ideal, most developers
don't like taking "outside" patches, especially where security or
network functions are concerned.  Applications designed for modularity
are a lot better.  Many apps are a "moving target".
3) Cypherpunks developing "libcypherpunks" or some other library which
includes cryptographic secure, anonymous, etc. replacements for
existing functions -- the md5 passwords vs. crypt in various unix OSes
is a good example.  Things which have no conventional analogue should
be packaged in a programmer-friendly way.  Some of these could include
distributed operations; general distrbution is really hard, but
certain specialized functions are easy, and having a good way to do it
would support experimentation.
4) Cypherpunks producing a "this is how to develop secure, privacy
protecting applications" document and training for conventional developers.
I assume most people who develop worthwhile software already
understand roughly "why" they should do this kind of thing, but that
don't know "how".
5) Participation in standards bodies to make "MUST" or "SHOULD" security for protocols (with the hope that standard/reference implementations
will be available).  I hate standards bodies, but some people seem to
get off on this, and it's not unhelpful.

question of running linux on an ipaq for a simple demo, with libgsm
compiled as integer; then maybe something more efficient.  I'm pretty
sure someone has made the bluetooth headset work with linux already,

The security of this would depend somewhat on the bluetooth

I'm unclear why Lucky dislikes the Sectra Tiger ( the
key management is not what I'd like, but seems designed specifically

market for a EUR 2500 encrypting cellphone.
I think the most cost-effective voice crypto solution today is a
bluetooth-enabled cellphone, a bluetooth-enabled PocketPC (ipaq) with
fast ARM, and then conventional encrypted-voice software (such as
speak-freely) running over PPP over bluetooth.  It would be fairly
easy to develop a belt or briefcase cellphone, handheld PDA with audio
I/O via headset worn on the belt or held in the hand (or, using an
Ericsson headset, stored in a briefcase as well), .  System cost USD
1000 or less, entirely COTS consumer hardware and open-source
software, and you get a free normal GSM cellphone, high-spec PDA
(==ecash terminal), and equivalent ease of use to the very best
cellphone (as you would be using a headset, carrying the phone and
processor separately).  If you're concerned about rf monitoring on the
local bluetooth side, you could substitute a wired headset/microphone;
if you're concerned about the general unavailability of
bluetooth-enabled fast PDAs, you could with an ease of use penalty use
I don't believe a dragonball could do viable voice crypto (especially
compression), at least without a coprocessor card, but perhaps it
could, and it certainly could support encrypted SMS.
You could possibly use your own non-standard link protocol, vs. PPP,
if you are concerned about latency, but it should be relatively easy
to achieve 100-200ms latency on cell to cell communications.   The benefit of using software which exists on general purpose machines
and TCP/IP over the link is of course that normal desktops could be
used as secure phone terminals as well, and I think there really isn't much demand for voice crypto in the
marketplace, outside the military and defense-mandated commercial
contractor use.  When audio I/O-enabled PDAs, bluetooth cellphones,
etc. are widely deployed, perhaps this will change (plus, bluetooth or
802.11b PDAs could serve as cordless phones with IP-IP or VoIP calling
when in range of a legitimate or borrowed network).
I've used speak-freely on a unix laptop for years, using IP transport
of opportunity, and with a good headset/microphone, it seems to meet
my needs for secure voice.
The other reason for using PPP-Voice is to abuse cell providers; in
the UK, for instance, I have a GBP 75/month unlimited-calling phone
(UK numbers); I could easily use this to dial in to a UK-based phone
with HSCSD and a fast IP connection at 14.4kbps, and then use IP-IP or
a VoIP bridge to get cheaper or free international calling; encrypted
by default to the gateway, and possibly to the other end if supported.

Quoting Bill Stewart :
I wasn't proposing the palm's audio subsystem; direct access to the
audio feed in/out of a bluetooth wireless headset, instead.  I would
probably do the same thing with an Ipaq, even though the ipaq 3600
hardware, linux, and wince-with-compaq-drivers support full duplex.
I think the ipaq is probably a better target platform, if it can be
done as a WinCE app, and not require putting linux on the device, or
if the device is sold pre-configured with linux and the secure voice
Ipaq also has the benefit of supporting 802.11, etc., so you could do
an "encrypted cordless phone" when around the office, with cell as a
way to roam.
Right -- 70MHz ARM7 is enough for ogg vorbis at nearly the
bitrate required, so I'm pretty confident this is possible on an ARM
platform.  Key management would tax a palm a bit, depending on how you handle
public key crypto, primarily on the battery side.  I suppose if you do
key generation on the palm when docked, it's not as much of a concern.
People have done CDPD voice before, but yes, the latency is a problem.
Most of the ultra-low bitrate encoding algorithms seem designed for
2.4Kbps...GSM is...13Kbps?  And so do do full-duplex gsm-quality you'd probably
need 4-channel HSCSD.  I assume cellphones are either simplex or
effectively so.
GSM does 9.6kbps modem/data connections (PPP).  In the civilized parts
of Europe, you can get High Speed Circuit Switched Data; basically,
channel bonding for GSM.  In the UK, 14.4Kbps HSCSD is free; 28.8kbps
is surcharged.
Since in the EU it is "caller pays", you could easily run an
on-network GSM gateway, with both sides supporting HSCSD, at 14.4kbps,
~150ms latency, operating 24x7, for about USD 110/month flatrate to
the calling side.  Nokia cardphones, Ericsson T39m and T68 all support
So palm would then be sort of feasible on a bluetooth-headset,
bluetooth-cellphone, with 28.8kbps HSCSD, at about USD 0.15/minute
cell to cell in the UK.
I suppose battery life is the concern; the ipaq can throttle back
quite a bit, so you could have a "call cost/audio quality/battery
life" multi-axis control.

@_subject: encrypted GSM project 
It looks like I've sold a number of encrypting GSM "phones" to an
existing client, and it also looks like there's some reasonable market
demand for them in general among our existing clients.  We'd discussed
this a while ago on the list; I wasn't sure of the commercial demand
for it, but it now appears it would be possible to sell 50+
units/year, easily.  So now I actually need to produce and ship the product.
The number one problem right now is lack of a name.  For now, it is "voice.havenco.com", but that isn't really ideal.
I'm planning to use:
* Compaq Ipaq H3870 running Debian Linux
* Ericsson HBH-15 wireless headset
* Ericsson T39m cellphone with largest battery (bluetooth draws standby
  power)
* IP54 case for the cellphone and PDA
We should have approximately 5 hours of talk time and 50-100 hours of
standby time.  Component cost is O(USD 1000), target sale price is USD
1999 per unit.
I'd like to make the system eventually run as both a WinCE app and a
linux app, but will ship pre-configured linux ipaqs with secure update
infrastructure, a GnuPG client, and voice crypto, as per the user's
requirements.  I may also add a gale client, vtfugu, for realtime
encrypted IM, and I'd also like to add a secure whiteboard app
someday.  The platform can also support the iButton for secure
storage and key management, but initially just a closed PDA-based
security model (with keys encrypted on disk using GPG, but no
protection from malicious hardware replacement and trojaning, and only
OS-level protection from remote compromise of keying material; good
enough for this client, for now)
One feature the user has demanded is a proxy server to allow
presence and outbound-firewall-only pairs to communicate, hosted on
One feature I intend to add is interoperability with a standard
laptop/desktop client, either a shipping or modified version of Speak
Freely or equivalent.
What I'd like to know from the "cypherpunk community" is if there are
any features people definitely want, thoughts on the price point, and
any other comments.  Keep in mind the target market is closed networks
of under 20 users who need to communicate securely.
I also want to add a PSTN or VoIP-PSTN interface to the proxy server,
so by connecting to it, encrypted, you can get incoming or outgoing
unencrypted calls patched in.  Using existing Open.H323 tools seems to
be the way to go here.  This would also allow an entire PBX to be
"encryption enabled" with a single gateway, and can be done on
existing PBX to VoIP gateways (at least open, software-based solutions).
A java applet client may be possible, so a "click here to talk to a
user of the secure phone system" might happen someday.
I'm going to probably do some improved form of key management over
what Speak Freely currently does -- possibly the same technically, but
a cleaner UI and some kind of group management on the proxy server by
a given client's administrator (by signing keys locally).
The revenue-extraction model is to charge a ~100% markup on
pre-configured terminals (integration on these is a pain), provide the
software as open source, but run a proxy presence server with other
features, updating, etc. and either charge for that as a service or
make money with value-added VoIP gateways or other features.  I see
the per-user proxy fee being USD 25-USD 200/month, depending on call
volume and features (conference calling, etc.)  Email and secure text
messaging (via gale) may be included.  Additional clients (ecash?
whiteboard?  contacts DB stored locally or centrally?  etc.) can
easily be provided from the proxy server update download interface
(==apt-get w/ wrapper).    Also larger clients, such as this one, are buying entire proxy servers
dedicated to their own use; rate is USD 1500/month plus possibly a
premium for the software and support.
I do not particularly care if any "cypherpunk" users buy these; the
market I see is offshore financial networks, law firms specializing in
incorporation or financial transactions offshore, and other closed
networks.  By providing a free PC client which interoperates, people
with $0 budget can still interact with paying customers, increasing
the value of the tested, reliable, mobile solution.  (the mobile
terminals can easily be used as cordless landlines with an 802.11b
card, or 56kbps modem, or ethernet card, or even irda or wired
bluetooth base station)
A future enhancement of hacking the t39m or some other good triband
bluetooth hscsd phone to allow imei/etc. to be changed per call would
be excellent :)
(the whole thing is just a messy integration problem, just UI code and
packaging/releng/testing, so there's not a huge amount of work to do)
15 April - Working Bluetooth to Ipaq-linux connection, OSS shims for
bluetooth headset profile (waiting for hardware)
Speak Freely working on Ipaq/ARM (I've done this, sort of)
25 April - Speak Freely to Speak Freely connection on Ipaqs with
headsets over 802.11b or ethernet (done)
15 May-30 May - tune for PPP over 56kbps modems and 28.8kbps HSCSD
(GSM codec, 11kbps to start, then maybe something more aggressive)
then the other features and improved codecs.  I'm hoping to ship a
prototype to the customer in early June.
I should have some demo units at H2K2/Defcon/Blackhat for people to play
with; I'll probably set them up with 802.11b rather than cell since I
pay $2/minute roaming in the US.  (should be able to use "traffic
shaper" to simulate phone connections) Thanks to John Walker et al. for the great speak freely client.  (the
code looks...ok...and a lot better than writing from scratch!)

useful for DRM.  If the entire machine is inside the envelope, it seems obviously useful for DRM, and DRM would likely be the dominant application.

user authentication and keying, and to allow the user to load initially-trusted code onto the general purpose CPU, but where the user
can fully use whatever general purpose code on the general purpose CPU,

============================== START ==============================
[summary: "TCPA is a tool which even if not necessarily always used
for DRM applications, and other far more evil applications, is
dangerous enough that it must be killed to prevent the introduction
of, and legal mandate for, these DRM and other more evil
applications.  People should be prepared to make some sacrifices to
accomplish this goal."]
(long rambling exposition follows: overview, possible worlds, possible
means of resistance, my suggested integrated course of action)
The current TCPA argument is, I believe, the beginning of a three
staged war, with the ultimate potential loss being all freedom.  It is
much bigger than the issues of security for applications or of
copyright.  A conspiracy does not need to have conscious participation
by all parties; those with knowledge of the entire situation can do
enough simply by failing to act at key points, rather than taking
affirmative action.  Completely valid agendas can be piggybacked in
order to get other aims accomplished.
Yet, as much as I hate the idea of TCPA, the concept behind it has a
few legitimately useful security applications I can see, and has been something I've thought about for years in a specific area.  While there's a good debate about TCPA with respect to general purpose
computing, that kind of "the secure hardware module IS the company"
computing is a useful model for some specialized tasks.  Hardware
crypto modules which allow general purpose computation already operate
in this mode, and as long as the architecture is open (device
certified by one authority, code published and signed, secure and
deterministic/duplicable toolchain, certain device functionality like
"publish hash of executing program" available, users choose which
hardware modules, software vendors, etc. they trust), it can be a tool
for good.  Admittedly a tool which can be easily perverted for evil.
Being able to secure the entire platform on which a given piece of
code is executing, and to publish guarantees about that security to
users at a distance who will have reason to trust those guarantees, is
undeniably useful for a certain class of applications.  Ironically,
some of these applications themselves are key to liberty.
DRM systems are obviously something a lot of media execs lust after,
even out of proportion to the commercial realities, since they
inherently like control and hard ownership.  I'm sure most content
creators at the direct creation level would rather see more users for
the same profit; non-creative people in the industry of creation would
prefer to see the same revenue from a smaller population, as it leaves
a larger potential untapped marketplace.
DRM systems embedded in general purpose computers, especially if
mandated, especially if implemented in the most secure practical
manner (running the system in system-high DRM mode and not allowing
raw hardware access to anything at any time on the platform, rather
than trying to allow concurrent open and closed operation a la CMW),
and in a closed manner for revenue protection purposes (only
rich people get to sign the code, or at least only the keys of rich
people are widely distributed by default, and anything else requires
special operations by the user), are evil.
(There's the whole debate about the role of copyright, piracy, content
ownership, etc., which I doubt will be resolved any time soon, and I
think tying it too closely to the TCPA/DRM/etc. debate is dangerous,
as the intermediate results might suck a lot -- hopefully the
copyright and general economic restructuring debate will take a lot
longer than this particular issue of hardware restrictions)
Aside from the issues of legitimate security, and DRM, there's a third
hidden agenda behind the restriction of general purpose computing
hardware -- the removal of a very powerful tool from the public at
large.  While not stated even by the paranoids :) who claim TCPA is
obviously a wedge for DRM, it seems the logical conclusion.  Large
commercial enterprises, governments, and the like have a fear of
everyone in the world having tools of the same power; for the most
part, a single laptop computer is effectively the same as the sum of
all other machines in the world, for many critical applications.  Auto
companies would certainly be displeased by a $5 trivially distributed
tool to create cars, just add water, at basically zero marginal cost;
without means of protecting their franchise from limitless
competition, commoditization, and decentralization, companies need to
compete based on speed and agility of innovation.  There is no economy
of scale in that, indeed, massive diseconomies of scale.  General purpose computers are the equivalent of "just add water" (or
beer, or chemical of choice) and produce products and services.  As
such, they should rightly terrorize any organization which does not
compete purely by being the best, most dynamic, most innovative
competitor, any organization which uses its current position in the
world to try to maintain control over the future, in a static way.
That would seem to be the very definition of a government, or of large
commercial or non-commercial organizations.
All of the "evil" applications of computers, like anonymous
communications, could easily be eliminated by requiring a true-name
identity for all code, and optionally only certifying Approved
applications at some future date.  A more practical way of
accomplishing roughly the same thing is requiring that all
communications have true names attached, or some kind of potential
tracing, built in at the low level, rather than requiring every
high-level application to be certified; the key escrow battle of years
ago can be retroactively lost in this manner -- just make identity
info be included on all transactions, and then have a master key to
break the crypto on the processor)
II. Five possible worlds
1. As I see it, the best outcome would be for TCPA to just go away right
now, after some kind of mass public rejection, similar in motivation
to the marketplace rejection of intel processor serial numbers, etc.
However, if it just disappears without being soundly defeated and the
territory sown with salt, it will come back in a couple years.
2. A moderately tolerable case would be if TCPA is implemented in a
completely open way, and simply not used except by highly specialized
applications (not even commercial rights-management, but
user-specified actions like operating a "wallet agent" or whatever).  If it is simply so crude and annoying to use as to be
commercially unviable, but still distributed and used occassionally
for a while, that would be this case.  This would be TCPA as the
HP/etc. people claim it is intended, although there are strong
arguments that this is not the real motivation.  DivX (old version)
would fall somewhere between this and  a failure in the marketplace
vs. unencumbered technologies.
3. What would suck, but not completely, is if it is used
extensively for rights management on commercial content, such that
third-party media can be manipulated in compliance with a (possibly broken, but not en masse) DRM scheme, but user-created, or Free
content, can also be processed easily, and in parallel.  The system
can be used with the equivalent of "self signed keys" or whatever
fairly easily, without requriing reboots, and a viable distribution
strategy exists for such content.  Pirated/liberated versions of
formerly closed content could be redistributed effectively, and it's
up to pricing/market/users/etc. whether to use a pirated copy or a DRM
licensed copy.  (defense against piracy would be focused solely on
preventing legitimate copies from being used illegitimately, not on
preventing post-liberation content being distributed/used).  This is
effectively how DVDs work today, given that CSS and RPC are widely
defeated, and DivXes are available.
4. A bit worse would be if TCPA can only be used by rebooting the system,
or even requiring completely independent hardware (but still sold
through mainstream channels, and not a black market).  The
inconvenience of this would make using any non-DRM-managed media
(either user-created, or products of cracking the DRM system by a few
technically elite users, and then distributed to less informed users)
basically impractical; it would be an all or nothing, DRM or Open,
option.  The best case form of this is the DRM system being
constrained to a set top box, and the "media convergence" dying; it's
really just going back to 1980 and staying there.  In this case,
DRM is used by default on most systems, and affirmative and complex
user action is required to turn it off temporarily.  All-or-nothing.
Liberated copies of licensed content are enough of a pain to use to
force licensed content for most users, but DRM is also applied of
necessity to even legitimate-source content, lowering overall functionality.
This is "defense in depth" for preventing media piracy; preventing
liberated versions of content from being used effectively.  This is
basically the same as distributing DivX if RPC 2 becomes highly
effective in the future.
5. The worst case would be TCPA mandated everywhere, in the most restrictive
way, with a fairly impotent resistance to this, and basically no
trusted secure computational devices in the wild (  There are
issues far more important than copyright at stake when the right to
own a general purpose computing device fully under the user's control
is lost.  The DRM can be used to enforce other restrictions later,
unrelated to copyright -- only identity-linked document creation is
permitted, just like with high quality photocopiers or CD duplication;
only those with government licenses can use certain kinds of tools, etc.
This is the dystopia of Gibson.  People would smuggle in illicit
pre-ban CPUs just like they do with firearms today; instead of
automatic weapons buried in the back yard, parents could pass on to
their children a hermetically sealed case of Intel Pentium IIIs.
About the best outcome of this is that criminals would pay for the
services of hardware hackers, and hacking on hardware would be as cool
as cooking drugs is today, which might over time draw the right kind
of people into electrical engineering programs.  (and imagine protest
songs, 60s style or ghetto gangsta rap style, extolling the virtue of

As I see it, we could put all efforts into maximizing the chances of
 even though it may increase the odds of (4,5) vs. (1,2,3).  Or, we
could put all effort into preventing  even if that increases the
chances of (2,3,4) vs. (1).
What I'm genuinely in terror of is   I'd be fairly comfortable with
(1,2) from philsophical grounds (and actually, some of the uses in are things which interest me).  1,2,3 are probably tolerable even from
a wanting-widespread-piracy standpoint, and really, anything but (and to some extent,  is tolerable in terms of protecting computers
for anti-government use.
Also, this is by no means a one-time challenge.  If we get  to
start, it seems likely there will be an eventual slide toward unless there is some kind of great line in the sand beyond which they
cannot cross. As we've seen with the continual erosion of explicitly
protected liberties over the past century or two, this seems
ultimately futile unless there are powerful and commercial interests
constantly defending these liberties.  (This is why religion, and to a
lesser extent press freedoms, have won out over gun rights)  Unfortunately the powerful commercial entities may be on the wrong
side of this one, unless everyday business views this as a loss of
control over critical IT infrastructure.
As for actual approaches which could accomplish various strategies:
A) A public protest to "shun" TCPA as evil seems most likely to
accomplish 1 or 2, although if it fails, 3, 4, 5 are of unchanged
likelyhood (perhaps 5 would be a bit harder).  Focusing on the "they
want to take certain powers away from the user of the computer"
argument is sufficient for individuals, but TCPA could co-opt
businesses by claiming some of that power will be put into the hands
of MIS; a different argument would need to be made for corporate users.
B) Simply making the tools for DRM be inconvenient will mostly
confine it to  or  but UIs improve over time, so this is impermanent.
C) Focusing on killing the Hollings bill, etc. would reduce chances of
5, but would seem to leave the other options as unchanged.
D) Good DRM technical circumvention measures can make 1, 2, 3 pretty much
isomorphic.  (analog: the drug war, with draconian regulations
circumvented by brave Men of Commerce and Chemistry).  This is betting
on the difficulty of the DRM problem, and the incompetence of the
implementing teams; maybe a good bet for a while, but by the time they
get to 3.0, it would be a difficult challenge.
E) Good open-source and open-content can make 1, 2, 3, 4 the same as
1, by ensuring users turn off TCPA and simply refuse to use anything
protected by TCPA.  Truly effective piracy technology can do the same
thing for licensed content, but it would need to be so good that all
content is created by third parties, not by the licensed owners, much
like mp3 and divx today for most users.)  A world where  is tempered
only by the strength of piracy isn't all that satisfying since some
people have a moral need to obey the law.
F) Some kind of agreement by the majority of users to simply obey
basic anti-piracy anti-circumvention anti-encryption etc. practices,
in exchange for no technical restrictions.  This seems unlikely;
ultimately people like getting free media, a lot, and it can become a
tragedy of the commons.  Also, this battle is initially about
security, then about DRM, but then, I believe, ultimately about
getting the most powerful weapon in the modern world, general purpose
computing hardware, out of the hands of the populace.  This would
eliminate the demand for DRM on the part of the copyright holders
G) Elimination of copyright as a legal concept, obviating the issue of
legal protection for copyright.  This would eliminate option  and
make  highly likely; it becomes a pure technical battle, and that
is one the free world can win.  However, this does nothing to address
the non-DRM reasons for wanting this technology; preventing "evil"
applications on general purpose hardware.
H) Option 5 is probably so distasteful as to make it impermanent; if
it passed, any responsible citizen would resort to the canonical soap,
ballot, jury, ammo progression (although, given temperaments, not
necessarily in that order.)  The mass of distributed hardware and
information would make resistance most effective immediately after
passage of legislation; once secure hardware is taken away, secure
communications will wither, which makes organizing effective
resistance difficult.
One might question the sanity of being willing to escalate to the barricades
to defend one's right to secure, anonymous, private,
communications, but I think it is a legal and ethical obligation, once
all other avenues are exhausted, of every citizen of a free country.
So, I think my take on all of this is that it's worth doing the
* Trying to kill TCPA/DRM right away, through public protest, shunning
everyone involved with to any degree (boycott of all products which
include it, at least when viable alternatives exist, products of
companies which are involved with it or have other products which
implement it, etc. Promotion in the press of all the potential evil of
scenario  and focusing the debate on  vs.  as much as a
binary choice as possible)
* Promote and publicize failures of TCPA/DRM systems to the extent
possible; emphasize any serious losses of security, privacy, control,
etc.  Try to come up with byzantine failures specifically to shake
public confidence in the systems.  The WTC-aftermath Windows XP
lockouts are a good example.  "Why we don't have automobiles with
speed governors centrally set to  -- because
sometimes there are overriding legitimate reasons to break the law".
People have an inherent revulsion to having power taken away from
them, even if they never used that power in the past, and would be
unlikely to do so in the future; this should be marketed.
* Technical circumvention of all DRM mechanisms to render them
impotent, and make them as intrustive/annoying as possible to be
effective, so as to be commercially unviable.  Ideally people wouldn't
even watch DRM-protected movies, but I think as long as no revenue is
received by the offenders, it should be ok (if there's a war, you
don't engage in commerce with the enemy, but stealing all their
resources is a good in and of itself)  This mitigates the actual harm
done if TCPA/DRM are adopted by vendors, without compromising the TCPA
vs. no-TCPA debate.  This also shakes vendor faith in DRM/TCPA systems.
* Shadow distribution networks for original and "liberated" content to
the extent possible, such that it is EASIER to get warezed versions of
all content, make use of them, etc., than to use the legitimate
option.  DRM actually helps with this, to the extent that it makes
full use of legitimately purchased media as difficult as possible.
The risk is of course good circumvention and distribution networks can
be used as arguments for TCPA/DRM by the enemy; however, this shifts
the argument into  vs.  space, which is good.
* Vigorous protest, with unlimited escalation potential, against the
Hollings bill and any future bills, using all required means.
Preventing world  is my absolute highest goal, so as to keep the
battle in the technical arena where better software can solve the
problem, and where general purpose hardware is retained as a tool for
other, more important wars as well.  * A social agreement among all reasonable people to not make use of
TCPA or DRM in their applications; to not require links to real-world
identity to operate their systems; to allow anonymity, security,
privacy, etc. wherever possible.  The sacrifice is not using general
DRM-capable security technologies even if for non-DRM applications, to
make those DRM-capable systems ineffective in the marketplace.  This
is *WAY* more evil than using MS IE-specific HTML tags, or requiring
SSNs for database keys, but the short-term benefits are probably
greater...this will be difficult.
* Obviously, don't work for companies or organizations which intend to develop TCPA or DRM applications, or which advocate their legal enforcement.  * Stockpile effective munitions, cryptographic and otherwise, against
the worst case option * Develop ways to do the few good things TCPA could do with
technologies not so easily perverted for evil.  Distributed,
decentralized systems; security-specific coprocessors, simply
minimizing the amount of private information required and collected at
the original point of interaction, rather than trying to protect it
once collected, etc.
* The ultimate copyright and intellectual propery debate, which will
likely not be resolved for decades.
However, I'm not sure of a few things:
* Is it worth making applications actively hostile to TCPA?  Doing
this risks making your application less widely used, and might make
the legitimate TCPA version win.  I think the best compromise is to
allow the user to do what he wants, but to ensure no revenue or other
advantage goes to the TCPA/DRM deploying organization...maybe if the
damage is greater than the payment it would be acceptable too.  Maybe
DRM cds should be playable, but by ripping the DRM cd and distributing
unencumbered mp3s at the same time.  This is probably an individual
question based on the market position of the official vs. resistance
* To what extent does having a viable technical circumvention system
in place both reduce the intensity with which people will fight the
imposition of controls (since they don't matter in practice), and
support arguments by the enemy for harsher DRM systems and legal
* To what extent is the loss of efficiency/security/etc. to large
companies not affiliated with DRM/TCPA/restriction of computing by
having those technologies deployed outweighed by the advantages to the
enemy organizations?  A slight improvement for major powerful
organizations, at the cost of the destruction of some relatively
powerless organizations, is probably going to go ahead; whereas
castrating some important but not dominant organizations may not be
acceptable, even if it results in a slighr improvement for more
powerful organizations.  However, I think big companies will all fall
into the "use regulation to prevent competition" camp, and thus
support the technology, even if they don't benefit from DRM.  Plus,
political lobbying is non-linear; if people care less than a certain
amount, they have no voice at all.
* Just how dead do you need to kill this idea to make sure "Never
Again"?  At a minimum I want the glowing wasteland left to be so bad
that people won't even think about going near similar ideas for a long
time, and that anything even remotely comparable will have as one of
the first debates "why this isn't like TCPA".
* Some of the steps suggested can make it impossible for anything like
TCPA/DRM/neutered computing from being effective in the future, if
implemented.  What additional steps can be undertaken to make sure
even if a similar thing passes in the future, it will have no effect?
This would seem to require removing whatever powers would be used to
implement these restrictions; SCOTUS rulings or constitutional
ammendments would be sufficient, as would be some kind of "arsenal of
democracy" to defend against such things.  Clearly the Traditional
Cypherpunk Applications are needed now, more than ever, as a check
against the powers of evil.

Basically, the concern I have is not that any *particular* end-user developed
application, in a post-DRM/TCPA world, will be rendered illegal, but that
the core of the machine will be modified such that a remote attacker
can deploy targeted or general sniffer/reporter trojans.  If you remove
the ability to compute in secret, with all communications widely .
The code which will be "illegal" on a DRM/TCPA/etc. machine, which
would actually be illegal if only those machines existed (which can be
done through restrictions on sales of new machines, or just special
kinds of I/O), is anything whihc can circumvent this DRM microkernel.  The DRM
microkernel will inevitably be implemented in a non-transparent way, allowing remote attackers superuser over OS-superuser access.
Switching to machines with one local root and lots of dumb terminals
would be roughly the same, except users have more explicit knowledge of
the power of root, and some influence over the selection of that root.
Simply eliminating the ability of most users to have a locally-secure
fully trusted execution environment, with processing, intermediate
storage protected from tampering or disclosure, etc., and network
communications, will kill cypherpunk applications.  If any cypherpunk
application requires the users to jump through hoops to get a reasonable
hardware platform, vs. just using a normal PC on his desk, there is
a bit of difficulty -- it's hard enough to get cypherpunk applications
deployed today, even without such restrictions.
It's possible the system will be designed to prevent remote control
at the microkernel level, but then the signed OS required to deal with
signed media objects on a daily basis, which most users will require,
may support this functionality.  Since this code will be signed, third
party patches will be prohibited.

There is a difference between a general purpose, if potentially very evil,
tool, like, say, handcuffs, or firearms, and a tool which has a very specific
intended purpose and very few possible other purposes.
If someone constructed a special machine which would check fingerprints,
positively identify someone as me (and only me), and then kill me, I would
feel it my self-interested obligation to destroy that device and anyone
associated with it.  It's a selfish cost-benefit analysis which I would
expect everyone to undertake on his own.
At some point a technology goes beyond being a general purpose tool and becomes
a specialized implement of policy.  Particularly when there are already
laws passed to leave an implement-sized hole, which once filled by
a specific implementation of technology, can accomplish great evil,
particularly when assisted by laws already on the books.
A device which makes drug testing of people at a distance completely
trivial to undertake would probably be "evil" in my opinion.  Certainly
the underlying technology and science is interesting, but once assembled
into the "police-o-matic drug tester" with integrated execution module,
it's evil.
I don't really believe in "good and evil", but evil is a useful shorthand
for certain classes of things.  Ultimately, DRM is anti-science (in that
laws like the DMCA will prohibit exploration) and anti-freedom (in that
it will ultimately of necessity lead to the end of general purpose computing).
Evil really means "counter to my ideals sufficiently that I will take
arbitrarily arduous action to eliminate it".  The nation-state is Evil.
Stovepipe jams are annoying, but not evil.  (I would take action to
eliminate bad-but-not-Evil, but wouldn't go so far as to hack off a limb
or whatever).
I consider the nation state to be evil.  While I'm perfectly happy to pirate
media, I would not consider purely technical means of preventing this to
be evil, until and unless the nation state becomes involved in supporting
those technical means.  Since the laws (DMCA, specifically) are already in
place to support DRMs, they are already officially Evil.
I assume there are enough people who are either (or both, but not necessarily)
anti-government and pro-hacking-as-discovery that they would consider DRM
either Evil or just bad.  If the people who just find them slightly bad
protest DRM technologies in the early stages, they are welcome to withdraw from the debate when it escalates to an all-out battle to preserve general purpose computing hardware in private hands (although
hopefully osmosis would cause them to feel DRM is actually Evil, too)

I consider DRM systems (even the not-secure, not-mandated versions)
evil due to the high likelyhood they will be used as technical
building blocks upon which to deploy mandated, draconian DRM systems.
DRM systems inevitably slide toward being more mandated, and more draconian.
DRM-capable TCPA-type systems are evil by the same argument, even if
not used for DRM.
The primary reason they are evil is not the stated goal of DRM systems
(copy protection in various forms), but the ease with which they could
be used to eliminate cypherpunk applications.
If DRM systems were truly general purpose themselves, capable of being
used for good and bad purposes, I would agree they are not inherently
evil.  However, because they never do anything but remove power over
bits from people who would otherwise have complete control over them,
I can't think of any good they could possibly accomplish.
Taken in the context where if a technical solution exists, lawmakers
will mandate it even if it isn't necessary, sometimes technologies
which are not innately evil are so dangerous as to be necessarily
rejected to avoid a legislative consequence.  If, for instance, a
perfect control chip were possible so that firearms could never be
used to kill an employee of the US Government, even if this technology
were optional, I would consider it evil, as it both prevents a
possibly-acceptable use of the technology, and removes power from
whoever controls the technology at the time.
I wouldn't consider an electronic payment system which prevents
counterfeiting of currency to be "evil" in the same way as a DRM
system is, because the electronic payment system technology is not
trivially transformed into a gatekeeper on the use of secure private Copyright is legal enforcement of restrictions on the possessor of
bits.  As such, I consider it morally bad.  Additionally, it has
outlived its practical utility (which I agree it had at one point).
I support technologies which enable end-users to defeat restrictions
placed on them by content creators, governments, or others.
Defeating legislative solutions to problems also serves the useful
social purpose of reducing confidence in people's minds that the
government can control anything at all.
Defeating purely technical restrictions on how you can use something
is hacking at its most pure form.  This is not really on the axis of
good vs. evil; it is simply an example of man's desire to control the
world around him.  Admittedly, defeating fundamental physical
limitations on what something can do is a lot more rewarding than
defeating restrictions artificially imposed by another person, but
it's still a worthwhile challenge.
I think those who create should be free to use technical, social, or
other non-coercive means to accomplish their goals.  However, creating
technologies which can be easily legislatively mandated, or relying on
legislative solutions to business problems, is wrong.
While I'd certainly prefer a world where creation of worthwhile
content is rewarded and encouraged, I would far prefer if every artist
starved rather than a world where general purpose computing is
restricted at all.  The "military" applications of computing are far
more important than art or culture.
