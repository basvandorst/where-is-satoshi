It seems like you are describing something like nodejs here, no?
If you don't like low-level node code or you don't trust it or things =
are missing or you can not do it efficiently with js or you don't want =
to use js for strategic pieces, you can do your C++ modules with node =
and link them with high level js. This approach might restrict the use =
of the code to some platforms and not open it to others like browsers, =
ff os, chrome...

Redefining anything in js is visible as "your nose on your face", as =
well as importing silently anything, whatever obfuscation/minification =
means are used it's trivial to check.
But here you do not have necessarly to import things and/or libraries, =
you can package everything with your app so you control your package and =
nothing can come from the outside or be injected.
Node is not an enormous platform with tons of dependencies, easy to check.
My opinion...
You should bring node to FF OS :-)

Without any hesitation: js + nodejs (note: I am not part of the node's team)
- the code is very reduced and transparent, difficult to backdoor =
including nodejs itself
- js is familiar but not trivial as many people think
- works on any platform, can even be browserified (see links below) --> =
note: that's not part of your criteria
- libraries are huge and great
- performances are great, especially with streams2 --> note: that's not =
part of your criteria
- security is ok, it can be affected by outside modules (like openssl), =
maybe the buffer model (which is not allocating memory upon creation for =
performances reasons) can be problematic but you can override native objects
- nodejs is easy to audit (assuming that modules like V8 can be =
audited), you can override node's functions/objects if you like
- your app is easy to audit, no compilation steps
- very easy to install, for contributions and use
- community is huge, nodejs is stable enough for production, the only =
small defect from my standpoint is that the upgrade process is sometimes =
not totally square for now.
Do you have links to your project?

Yes and different upload bandwidth of the peers make the timing
correlation even more difficult
Here we could have some packets that are lost by the peers, because of
UDP, because a peer left and broke a P2P Tor circuit, etc, then the
packets must be resent and x bytes sent is then not equal to y bytes
received, more generally it could be possible to send consciously
several time the same packets who will be dropped by the reasynching end
point, still x bytes sent will be equal to x bytes received at the end
point but not further, that's one of the topics of the project, to be

Yes: Let's imagine that one Tor circuit reaches a P2P network (here browsers)
and is splitted between different peers (UDP) circuits before
reasynching to a relay or end point, then the reconciliation from the
source to the end point is quite unlikely

I don't care at all what you think about "my stuff" and your completely
wrong appreciation/description of it, I was not referring to this only
Apparently you are trying to revive some old concepts that just can't
work with bittorrent
"Which is why bittorrent is moving into the overlays", please clarify
what you mean, why popcorn time shows up here, why you posted this
