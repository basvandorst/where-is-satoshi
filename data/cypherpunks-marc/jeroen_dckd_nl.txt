@_subject: [Cryptography] $750k Fine for exporting crypto 
It appears that the Bureau of Industry and Security is showing its teeth wi=
th a $750k fine against Wind River Systems for unlawfully exporting encrypt=
ion software to countries on the BIS list.
ensed export of encryption software that did not also involve comprehensive=
ly sanctioned countries (e.g., Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria). Th=
is suggests a fundamental change in BIS=92s treatment of violations of the =
encryption regulations.
