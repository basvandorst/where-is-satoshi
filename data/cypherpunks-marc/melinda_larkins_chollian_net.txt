And in these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied th=
e power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the  knowledge of=
 others, a State might try to work such a formidable engine! Never once di=
d he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never make an objecti=
on to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might be, or however fa=
r away, whether China or Congo. There remained, then, only two possible so=
lutions of the question, which created two distinct parties: on one side, =
those who were for a monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who=
 were for a submarine vessel of enormous motive power!! Until further info=
rmation, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a sea-unicorn of colossal di=
mensions, armed not with a halberd, but with a real spur, as the armoured =
frigates, or the 'rams' of war, whose massiveness and motive power it woul=
d possess at the same time.=20
