I've confirmed this report by talking to people in the UK. At least two

I imagine that you can also observe by exiting through certain nodes
that have censoring ISPs.
I wonder if these nodes should be marked as bad exits?

Thanks Eugen,
I wrote a nice BUILD document and sent it to or-dev last night. Here's a
copy of the mail for those not on or-dev:
-------- Original Message --------
Hello *,
Nathan and I have been working on making a viable, secure and usable
port of Tor to the Android platform. There have been a few attempts at
getting Tor or Tor like software (onion coffee, etc) to run on Android.
The most notable was probably Adam Langley's initial attempts. For quite
sometime, Nathan and I tried a few different approaches. Finally, we
stumbled upon a method for calling arbitrary binaries that are stored as
assets in a package. Nathan wrote a little about this method here:
We spent most of today working on an Orbot build document:
The BUILD document starts a user off without any Android tools on their
system. By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a working, signed Orbot
package. We will endevor to keep this document up to date.
Orbot provides a simple way to run the C reference implementation of
Tor. This means that we can have hidden services and all of the rest of
the Tor client/server/bridge functionality on Android. I expect that
hidden services will become popular if someone ports TorChat to Android.
Tor itself exposes the usual SOCKS proxy and Orbot extends this by also
offering an HTTP proxy. Part of the code that powers the HTTP proxy is a
powered by a fork of jsocks. We've named it asocks (Android SOCKS) and
put it in subversion:
The UI for Orbot really needs a lot of work. It will require a lot of
polish. Currently, it does do very basic controlling of Tor; it's mostly
by brute force and doesn't use anything fancy with the control port.
The next step will be to create a second application that actually uses
Tor. It will likely be a web browser that specifically utilizes Tor for
everything. This will be similar in scope to what Conell did for
TorProxy with his Shadow browser:
It is likely that we'll replace TorProxy in the market after we're
pretty sure that we're on the right path.
If you'd like to try a build of Orbot, I've put up an early alpha build:
If you have an android phone, you can scan this QR code to download and
install the package:
This is our first alpha release and we'd love some feedback...

Hi naif,
While we sometimes disagree on things, I think we're in full agreement
here. I think it's important to support your intentions in this thread.
Tor is targeted by extremely talented people who would never lift a
finger to help anyone involved in the Tor Project. The Tor network is
probably undergoing a constant audit by multiple parties with extremely
negative intentions. Certainly I hope we all agree that lots of people
wish they could attack Tor users directly and if nothing else, that may
serve as a motivator for some people to attack the network however they
I think you're getting a lot of noise and it's pretty sad for almost all
of the reasons that you outlined. I really appreciate that you're trying
to make a positive impact. I also appreciate that rather than going
around spreading FUD, you're trying to find a way to improve things,
even if perfection is not attainable. You're making observations about
where we can and even should improve software, improve operational
security and even where we have to punt.
I really appreciate that you're not working for people who wish to do
the Tor network harm. Please do consider the concerns of people in this
thread and weight your actions against those people. They too are trying
to help the network, the project, and the users.
Hopefully we'll all meet at CCC for a mate to discuss this in person!

Maxim Kammerer:
This has serious intersection attack issues, as you note. However, from
a purely practical perspective, even with our UPnP/NAT-PMP work, it's
basically not realistic with ipv4 to make *everyone* a globally
reachable relay.
I do however generally agree with the sentiment that we need to make it
significantly harder for an attacker. It's not clear to me that if
everyone was a relay, they would change the exit selection very much. It
would probably change the location of the guards as expected.
Sadly, it probably wouldn't work well for everyone being an exit - not
the least of which is that running Tor would attract attention beyond
just sending/receiving encrypted traffic.
Thanks for taking the time to start this discussion Maxim - it's a good one.

Dear Mike,
Mike Hearn:
Thanks for joining the discussion; I've talked with a number of people
from Google about this and you might be the person we've been looking to
The phone portion of this is extremely problematic - to tie a username
to a phone may create a direct link with a government issued ID card.
That in turn will create liability for the user and also likely for
Google, who now holds the key to the user's anonymity.
Is there a possible way to pro-actively indicate that a user will want
to use Tor? For example - if you notice they're regularly in Iran,
China, Syria and so on - won't current events of filtering be enough to
tip Google off to the political changes that impact how users connect?
Is there a way to add that token to the email authentication happening
with Thunderbird and TorBirdy?
It would be quite helpful if we could add a setup wizard to TorBirdy
that could walk a user through doing these things safely. I fear that
any setup is a usability nightmare but no clear path to such a setup at
all is perhaps even worse.
It does indeed - thank you for writing on the list!
As a slight aside - I have noticed that the Gmail login list does not
seem to know about Tor nor about XMPP logins. It also sometimes has
extremely inaccurate GeoIP data. I have on many occasions been warned
that my account was hacked from China (!) only to find that the access
was of type "Unknown" (rather than say, HTTP) and rather than China, it
was a Tor exit node that I was using at the time.
It would be quite nice if Google's audit log was Tor aware - so as to
reduce panic - and if it didn't say unknown, when it was clearly via
XMPP. Unless this was a bug in some kind of wiretapping interface, of
course. In which case... forget that I mentioned it! :)

I guess you haven't heard that in many parts of the world, such as
Uganda, people are on the verge of being put to death for their sexual
*preferences* alone?
This entire argument is flawed. Please demonstrate or provide evidence
for your claims!
One could equally assert without evidence that the production of erotic
art and the consumption of legal (say, in the US) pornography reduces
adult on adult predatory activity. I bet the Kinsey Institute would have
interesting data on this very topic but well, since this isn't a
conversation based on facts but rather on emotion, I'll not even bother
to dig up a citation. If you show some facts for your arguments, I'm
sure people will bring out data in support of other view points.
So please - show us that the existence of abstract material is the sole
or even a major contributing factor to an act of non-consensual or
otherwise illegal or immoral sexual conduct. Does that currently
non-existent data support your argument? Would it support your argument
for other kinds of abuse?
Does evidence of a killing, such as Oscar Grant's murder in Oakland,
California[0] by the BART police make other police want to kill
civilians? Or does it make people want justice for the death of Oscar
Grant? One might argue that the evidence will actually reduce the
chances that another cop will get to say he meant to pull a stun gun.
Documentation seems to very seriously change the human rights abusers
position of power - be it the police or other groups that derive a
subject's compliance through forced violence.
Or put another more simple way - the problem with child porn is not the
*evidence* of the crime alone, it is that people are actually harming a
living being. The murder of a guy, such as what happened in Oscar
Grant's case, is pretty disturbing - shall we erase that crime from the
archives of history because journalists claim protection under the First
Amendment protections? Why should we create a special class of
information that we flush down the memory hole, where only special
people are allowed to look at it, to judge it and where merely being
accused of being near it is a (cultural) death sentence?

Traffic analysis is likely feasible if you can watch all of the
internet. The question is at what resolution? With full packet captures
of everything, for all time, it becomes a statistical question with some
possibly negative outcomes.
Actually, we see from the documents that they cannot deanonymize all
people, all of the time; they must target. So actually, it *does*
protect people from instantly falling into the pitfalls related to
dragnet surveillance. You're avoiding this and it is totally silly.
The Tor Project is a 501c3 non-profit. As a company, we're not tools of
anyone and as a tool, tor, is similarly not a tool of the US government.
Your statements indicating otherwise are just rude and uninformed.
Could you possibly be more of an asshole, Juan?
How does that old quote go? "That which is presented without evidence
may be dismissed without argument." Yeah, exactly.
The NSA and the GCHQ ran a real operation to deanonymize someone. Do you
understand how they attempted to do this? Do you understand the evidence
presented or will you continue to ignore it?
Yes, you did - read the above documents already? The CES summer school
document discusses some of this and it is sadly very poor research. The
open community, such as Aaron's recent paper, is much much further
ahead. This is what we expect - this is why we work with an open
research community so seriously.
I'm giving you some credit - break it, already?
Can you please explain to everyone how they found the location of the
Silk Road? Hint: it wasn't Tor, it was his extremely bad operational
security and using... a VPN!
You criticize the only people working to inform the public and you
degrade their honor without having real information about their
specifics. Do you live under threat for your work? Do you live in exile
from your home country? Do you do anything that matters where someone
else has some criticisms because they don't have a full view on your
entire life or because they misunderstand something about what is
presented in public?
Ah, I see - you're basically just green with envy? Well, get in line, eh?
You could actually demonstrate that you see that Glenn, Laura and others
have taken real risks by doing anything at all to inform us. The way
that you behave, it is a wonder that they take such risks with people
