Several years ago I reviewed a new design for FreeBSD's PRNG. It was
vulnerable to sources that had high data rates but low entropy (they
effectively "drowned out" lower data rate sources). This was fixed,
but I wonder how common an error it is?

Have they forgotten the enormous amount of suspicion last time they tried this?

I thought it was well known that "Satoshi" holds many Bitcoins?
FOSS is "Free/Open Source Software". Pond is a secure messaging system

You don't make a strong case for your rather over-broad claim above.
Though I do agree that crypto (like pretty much everything else) does
require someone to somehow support those who develop it. And those who
deploy it need to have a reason to bear the costs of doing so. And so
on. But this is not as simple as "No security protocol will achieve
wide adoption unless it includes a revenue model which someone can use
to build a business." You "explain" several counter-examples above,
for instance.

Look, if you don't want to admit you don't know how to do it, fine -
but don't try to blame me for that.
500 references that have something to do with passwords. So far I
haven't found any that discuss usable implementation of TLS-SRP or
However, I do notice you claim to address at least some of the
usability problem yourself, pp 547-552. I hope I am mistaken, but I
couldn't find any evidence of secure usability testing in those pages.
Has there been any?
On p.552, for example, you have a diagram headed "Non-spoofable
password entry dialog". This makes me suspicious, because it is well
known that these dialogs are entirely spoofable.
None, because, as you should well know (because we've discussed it
every time we've met for the last several years), I don't think
certificates are effective in protecting browsers from phishing (not
that browsers need protecting, users do, but I don't think they work
for that, either).

Come on, seriously? As I said below, I'm prepared to retract that
requirement, but I still ask: what is the point of using a ZKP if it
isn't to conceal the password from the site operator?
In any case, your position appears to be "you should implement this
even though I cannot point to a single example of how". Not tenable.
Pinning does not scale: you risk your site becoming unavailable for an
extended period if you screw up. Remediation is necessarily manual.
I think it is absurd to claim nothing happens. Certificate
Transparency and Safe Browsing are two obvious examples that improve
user security and have none of the above going on.

On Thu Dec 04 2014 at 7:22:16 AM Peter Gutmann Oh really? Please provide references. Actually, I don't have time to be
drowned in a million crap papers, so please, for now at least, provide a
reference for the best solution you are aware of (or two or three if
choosing is hard).
There are many papers on how to do it badly. I have yet to see one (backed
by actual testing, I am not interested in usability by assertion) that's
actually deployable.
I did muse about that one for a while, and surely its the point of using
zero knowledge protocols? If it is not, then what is?
But if you really think its impossible, I'm certainly prepared to drop it
as a requirement.
And you claim that don't want to because they're all is a secret cartel to
keep CAs in  business? Really?

On Wed Dec 03 2014 at 4:51:53 PM Peter Gutmann I think that's a completely unfair accusation - the difficulty has always
been the lack of a _usable_ way to _securely_ implement such protocols.
And by "usable" I mean a user experience that is
a) satisfactory to the user.
b) satisfactory to the site operator.
c) possible to transition to from existing systems easily (for at least the
And it has to be secure - which includes "not allow credential theft _even
by the site operator_".
This appears to be a tall order. But produce it, and I would certainly
fight hard for implementation.
BTW, its not clear to me how either of these would remove the need for
something with a CA-like role.
Also, the same difficulty is a barrier to PAKEs.
