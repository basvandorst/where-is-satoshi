@_subject: There is absolutely nothing to worry about 
from There Is Absolutely Nothing To Worry About
By Diane Harvey
I realize people are nervous and unsettled but I don't understand why
anyone should be upset or worried about anything. Personally, I feel just fine. I believe "They", our wise leaders, are
doing as well as can be expected so far, if I am understanding any of
this correctly: They don't know where their main target is. They aren't sure if it matters anyway. They aren't sure that going after Afghanistan is necessary, but maybe
it is. They aren't sure where they can base their stuff, but certainly
something will work out. They want to do some serious stuff immediately, but some of them
don't. They think maybe a lot of bombs would be really good, but maybe not. They think that nuclear weapons are probably not a good idea, but
maybe they are. They aren't sure what sort of stuff they want to do, or where, or
when, or to whom, but they are sure there must be something. They say that some of their allies aren't sure if they really want to
help, but maybe they will. They have lots of evidence that it was bin Laden and the Taliban's
fault and maybe they will share this soon, but maybe not. They aren't sure if it was Lebanon's fault, but it might be. They aren't sure if it was Iran's fault, but it might be. They aren't sure if it was the Palestinian's fault, but it might be. They aren't sure if it was Saudi Arabia's fault, but it might be. They think maybe Saddam did it, but maybe not. They do know for sure it was certainly many people's fault anyway,
whoever and wherever they are. They know that the countries in the current deployment and attack
regions are extremely volatile, but assure us that maybe nothing will
happen. They know that biological, chemical, or even nuclear attack in this
country may be immanent, but maybe not. They say that our water supplies are in danger, but maybe not. They say that there are probably a lot of people here who are going
to do terrible things, but maybe they won't. They say not to worry about this because there is nothing you can do
to protect yourselves anyway. They say the economy will remain strong, but maybe it won't. They say that the best thing we can do about all this is to go out
and buy more stuff. They say that we need a whole lot of new laws immediately because we
are in grave danger and this is no time to be fussy about an outdated
and hampering Constitution. Doesn't this sound like a good plan to you? I don't see anything here
for any normal person to bother worrying about.

@_subject: EPIC sues big brother 
Privacy advocates have filed a lawsuit in federal court to force the Justice and Treasury departments to disclose details about buying information about individuals from commercial databases. The agencies are generally banned from amassing such information on their own.
Electronic Privacy Information Center officials said Jan. 15 that the two agencies have illegally failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests for details about their information purchasing practices. Lawyers for EPIC sought the information after seeing news reports and obtaining documents that indicate at least six federal law enforcement agencies buy personal information from database                           The companies include ChoicePoint Inc., which gathers and sells                           information for purposes ranging from employment background                           checks to insurance fraud investigations, and Experian, which claims                           to have information gathered from "hundreds of public and                           proprietary sources" on 215 million consumers.
                          The Privacy Act of 1974 banned federal agencies from collecting                           personal information about individuals unless they are actively                           investigating the individual. But no such prohibitions apply to                           database companies.                           The companies collect data from a wide range of commercial and                           government sources, such as credit card records, motor vehicle and                           property records, license records, marriage and divorce data,                           bankruptcy and other court databases, product warranty                           registrations, loan applications and other sources.
                          Government agencies that buy the information include the FBI, the                           Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshals Service, the                           Internal Revenue Service, the Immigration and Naturalization                           Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,                           according to EPIC.
                          A key concern for privacy advocates is how accurate the data is,                           said Chris Hoofnagle, EPIC's legislative counsel who filed the suit.                           ChoicePoint, for example, provided inaccurate data to Florida                           election officials, who denied thousands of voters access to the polls                           in 2000.                           Hoofnagle said EPIC obtained documents that show that information                           the IRS bought from ChoicePoint and Experian included "credit                           header data," which includes a person's name, current and prior                           addresses, Social Security number, date of birth, telephone number,                           information from property records, motor vehicle records, marriage                           licenses and divorce papers, and records of international asset                           location. IRS employees have access to this data through their                           desktop computers, Hoofnagle said.                           It is not clear whether the agencies buying information are violating                           the law, "but if they are buying information without real investigations                           going on, then there are going to be problems," he said.
                          The Privacy Act was passed to stop information collection abuses                           that were common during the 1960s and 1970s, when the FBI and                           other agencies compiled detailed dossiers on Vietnam War                           protesters, civil rights activists, political "enemies" of the president,                           celebrities and others.                           Hoofnagle said recent cases show that the abuse of information by                           government employees has not ended. Recent abuses include police                           employees using information to track women for dates and to rob                           rental cars and federal employees selling DEA data, he said.                           "You don't have to have a rogue government, just a rogue civil                           servant," he said.                           The Justice Department has 30 days to respond to the suit.

Bush May Limit Germ Weapons Info
 By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration is considering whether to restrict distribution of
 government documents that describe how to make germ weapons, White House officials said Sunday.  U.S. stockpiles of offensive germ warfare agents were destroyed nearly three decades ago as part of
 the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. But the government kept the blueprints for manufacturing
 such weapons, and continues to sell them.  ``The administration is generally conscious of this issue,'' John H. Marburger III, director of the White
 House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a telephone interview Sunday. ``There are
 obviously people thinking about what to do about it.''  The administration is likely to take action on the matter, Marburger said, adding that he did not know
 what action would be taken nor when.  Homeland Security director Tom Ridge hinted that the administration is strongly considering placing
 new restrictions on the information.  ``We are a very open society and we're very much an information society, and there are a lot of us that
 think that some of the information we share with the public probably should be restricted in some
 fashion,'' Ridge said on CNN's ``Late Edition.''  Marburger and other administration officials are ``looking to see what kind of information should be so
 easily available in the public domain,'' Ridge said. Members of Congress have also aired concerns
 about the issue, he said.  ``We are open, we are trusting, but we have to be a little bit more careful and a little bit more vigilant,''
 Ridge said. ``And we may have to take a look at these kinds of issues from a different perspective
 because of the tragedy of September 11 and the follow-on incidents that we've had to deal with.''  Several agencies are weighing the level of danger and possible action, Marburger said. A
 spokeswoman for the Defense Department said Sunday she could not comment, as did a White House
 spokesman. Representatives of the Justice Department (news - web sites) and the White House Office
 of Homeland Security did not return calls.  Marburger said he had not personally seen the documents on assembling such weapons. Among the
 questions is how dangerous they are, he said.  ``It is clear that they are based on a picture of biology that's almost 50 years old,'' he said. ``It's not
 clear to me how useful they are.''  The New York Times first reported on the documents and the debate in Sunday editions, and said
 despite their age, the manuals contain information that could help produce the kind of anthrax powder
 infected at least 18 people and killed five in the United States last year.  According to the newspaper, federal agencies routinely sell the now-declassified documents to
 historians and researchers. The government provides more sensitive papers on the subject after
 Freedom of Information Act requests.  Dr. Harry G. Dangerfield, a retired Army colonel, is preparing a report for the military that will call for
 the reclassification of more than 200 reports that he told the newspaper are cookbooks for turning
 germs into weapons.  Any such move to reclassify the manuals would run into resistance from advocates of public access to
 government documents.  Moreover, an executive order signed by then-President Clinton (news - web sites) in 1995 bars
 reclassification, the Times said. The Bush administration is considering its own order allowing the
 documents to once again be kept from public view, it reported. Marburger said Sunday he did not
 know about any such move. I found to have enough info to culture and sporulate, though
you'd have to look elsewhere for freeze drying and milling

@_subject: RE: The Original SSSCA 
The solution to the current problem is so simple that it is hard to
believe that no one is pushing it forward.  It involves purely voluntary
actions, with no legislation at all required.
The proper solution is to encourage DRM (digital rights management)
software and hardware developers to offer solutions in the marketplace.
Let computer manufacturers include so-called "trusted computing" features
in their systems.  These will allow content to be personalized to a
particular computer and only display on that computer.
Let them continue to work towards encrypting as much of the data path
as possible, so that only analog signals will be available unencrypted.
Systems like HDCP, once improved by the cryptographic community, will
lead to speakers and video displays that have only digital inputs, on
which the data is encrypted.  Sampling of images and sounds will only
be possible in the analog domain, requiring a re-digitization phase and
a single-generation loss in quality.
The marketplace will then consist of several types of content.  Some will
be sold by the content providers in encrypted form, customized for
display on a single device (or a specific set of devices).  This will
be high quality.  Some will be pirated versions of such content, taken
from the analog domain.  These will be slightly lower quality.  And some
will be conventional and pirated content made available for display on
ordinary systems not requiring trust-management features.  These will
be created by content providers who don't care much about piracy.
Consumers will have a choice of purchasing systems with and without
DRM features.  Or if they get a system with DRM chips and software, they
will have a choice about whether to purchase content for use with those
features.  Anyone who creates or distributes content will likewise have
a choice about whether to make it freely available or to use DRM features.
Everyone wins in this system.  Each participant is able to make his own
choices about what to do, with no way to coerce or force anyone else to
behave differently than they desire.
Yet both privacy advocates and content owners fear this solution.
Content owners are afraid consumers would reject DRM technology,
forcing owners to continue to make their content freely available.
Privacy advocates are afraid that equipment manufacturers will stop
making systems without DRM technology, forcing consumers to accept
whatever limitations and prices content owners choose to dictate.
Each side feels that it must use force to make sure that its own desires
are met.  Neither is willing to accept the risk that the solution found
by the marketplace will not be their ideal.  Both sides are part of the
problem, not part of the solution.
The solution is to reject legislative approaches and to encourage
development of a variety of approaches to managing content.  DRM systems
may or may not be a good solution, but they should not be rejected out
of hand.  A competitive marketplace with a multiplicity of options will
provide the most robust foundation for the future of digital content.

Bauhaus? I guess. More like that 70s warmed over post-Bauhaus fascist crapola. Nobody in NYC really thought they were beautiful, but we do miss 'em (see above!).

"One thing I liked in particular was that most of the designs weren't afraid to go high into the sky this time around. Building high is an expression of confidence."
This I more or less agree with. And it's not a government thing, not a business thing, just a New York thing. We need replacement towers for sure, and that design by David Rockwell & Co (with those odd empty tower-structures) might be good. They have the additional advantage of not casting such a dark shadow over downtown and Brooklyn Heights. PT wrote...

"Hideous boxes." Again, you miss the point. We New Yorkers navigated by them, and when traveling out in th'sticks (ie, New Jersey and west of the hudson) those ugly boxes would come popping up over the horizon welcoming you home, just like your ugly ole' Mom.
Somebody wrote, and I really don't remember or care who. Hell, let's say Tim May wrote it just to piss him off...
"My own initiial idea was to rebuild the towers as they were, but in goldtone instead of silver. Now, I'd like to be a little more respectful of the pre-WTC street grid (If you weren't actually going to the WTC, it was a huge obstacle to get around, either driving or on foot). But I still want towers which rise far above the skyline." That original twisty-towers design brought forward in response to how shitty the original official designs were by that Amalgamated Architects was the best design, but for some reason it didn't make it into the official final round.
"One hopes not a single fucking dime of taxpayer money will go into rebuilding anything on that site. (Oh, I won't scream if $25,000 is allocated to hire that Chinese architect to replicate her Vietcong wall with the names of the dead so that the weepy ones can do their tracings and all. But nothing more should be spent out of the taxpayer's pocket.)"
Like I said, you can either SEE your tax dollars build something (even if its useless), or else they'll just dissappear up some buereucrats (I can never spell that word) nose. Unless you pay zero taxes of course.
"(Ayn Rand loved the Twin Towers, ironically, and typically, and disgustingly. But, then, she thought cigarette smoking was a symbolic affirmation of Man's control of fire and his striving to reify A or Not-A through purity of essence!"
A read through a couple Ayn Rand books and none of this should be suprising. As far as I'm concerned she wasn't exactly von Neumann.

Actually, it is reality not a goal. A better statement would be "The US dominates the world, and if you act otherwise, we will kill you. If you think otherwise, we will find out and you will become a "person of interest" and placed on the "no-fly" and TIA watch lists. And if you are a US citizen, remember you are a check mark away from being an "enemy combatant" in a military prison of our choosing, with no lawyer, no judge, no appeal to anyone, anywhere, forever."
The US is no longer content to be  It demands respect for being  thru  inclusive.

@_subject: Re: Patriot II would outlaw encryption 
Sure you will. The "ongoing conspiracy" (an agreement to commit a felony) continues after various events. For example, if Ted and Alice have an ongoing implicit understanding that they will meet in the shed behind her house occasionally to tend the five marijuana plants growing there, that is an ongoing conspiracy to commit a federal felony. So if, a week after Ted's last visit, Alice sends him an encrypted email saying "Come over and watch a video, or whatever", the prosecutor can clearly use that (if he can decrypt it) as 5 more years in prison, since it used encryption technology and concealed an incriminating communication (the crime being conspiracy) that they are commiting (ongoing). The prosecutors can get Ted's passphrase by granting him immunity (probably ONLY immunity from the encryption enhancement penalty, or best case, from that and conspiracy, still nailing him for the pot felony, or getting Alice to roll over on him for the whole deal!!!!) and forcing him to disclose it having eliminated his 5th amendment defenses. Then they have Alice for the pot felony, conspiracy, and the 5 year encryption booster. Of course, they will simply hang all of this draconian punishment over her head, her attorney will say they can fight for $75,000 and 2 years, during which she is in jail, or they can plead it out and become a felon with few further rights of citizenship.
And if you "detail a crime" after the event in an encrypted communication, you've essentially included another person in the knowledge of a past crime in the expectation that such disclosure will remain secret from law enforcement. That is conspiracy to avoid prosecution and probably obstruction of justice. Conspiracy and obstruction are crimes, you've just used encryption in a federal felony, 5 year enhancement. Bye.

Nothing forces you to tell anyone else that you booted securely.  At most
someone may offer to give you something in exchange for such a proof,
but you're not obligated to take them up on it.
It's not clear what you're getting at about exporting the host key.
These systems (TCs) are generally designed to make that difficult or
impossible to accomplish.  The security of the whole system is built on
that assumption.  If you actually did manage to pull out the host key
then you could make it attest to any falsehood you wanted, although you
might get caught eventually.
Trusted Computing lets people convincingly tell the truth about what
software they are running.  This is seen as a horrific threat in certain
circles.  It's easy to see why liars wouldn't like it.  What does an
honest man have to lose?

@_subject: Off-the-Record Messaging (IM plugin) 
Nikita Borisov and Ian Goldberg have released
Off-the-Record Messaging (
an IM plugin for private communication providing not only
the usual encryption and authentication, but also deniability and
perfect forward secrecy.  Deniability avoids digital signatures on
messages (while preserving authenticity and integrity), so there is no
hard-to-deny proof you wrote anything in particular; in fact, there is a
toolkit to help people forge messages, making it extra-hard to pin
things on you.  Perfect forward secrecy means that your past messages
and conversations remain protected even if your keys are compromised.
You can read the OTR protocol description, download the
source code for the gaim-otr plugin, or grab a gaim-otr binary package for
Debian or Fedora Core.
