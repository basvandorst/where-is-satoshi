I honestly don't understand why you would say "...where they
actually need SSL...".
Let's first assume we agree on what we mean by various terms here:
That "environment" is one where people who are failed by
their computer communication security system suffer consequences
harsher (much, much harsher!) than a few hundred (or even a few
thousand) dollars of a monetary loss, and where their adversary
is a government unbridled by any need to subject their surveillance
projects to an approval by an independent judiciary.
"SSL" is a system that depends on the security on a large bunch
of "trusted third parties", all of which are selected by various
software vendors and any single one of them can completely subvert
the security of the said communication system.
It is obvious to me then that they ~don't need~ SSL; they should
be instructed to ~avoid~ SSL. Or am I wrong in my understanding
of what SSL is?

We can only offer our personal observations.
In my experience, only a very small percentage of users in
"general population" (of e-mail users) will assume their
e-mail is *at all* "protected from the government". I will
allow that there might be some (among those, but certainly
not in the "general population") who do indeed have highly
unrealistic expectations about the level of that protection.
I can not however imagine someone who is part of an organized
group actively working against a government (any government!)
to depend on gmail security. It's the "naive malcontents"
that end up in fishing nets of oppressive regimes. Yes,
they suffer in various ways, but they are hardly worth killing.
Big fish is hunted differently.

I am not the one to defend DigiNotar, but I would not make such
dramatic assumption.
No one actively working against a government that is known to engage
in extra-legal killings will trust SSL secured e-mail to protect him
or her from the government surveillance. If this particular case, if
the most often repeated hypothesis of who did it and why is correct,
it was probably done for some bottom net-fishing and will likely result
with a whole bunch of "little people" with secret files that will make
them "second-class" citizens for a long, long time, ineligible for government jobs and similar. (For instance, I'd expect them to end up
on some oriental no-fly list).

> discussion.
Yes, I agree, let's ignore it!
In your view then, is the alternative at all a public key based
crypto system? If yes, is it SSH (or SSH-like) "trust on first
contact" or something else?
~I~ have a dream: one nice morning, in a year or two, when we download
the new release of our favorite browser, it all of a sudden tells us
if the server we are connecting to employs SSL-nouveau (with a series
of trusted third parties, and who exactly they are) or SSH-nouveau
(trusting the continuation of server's public key in our possession).
In that brave new world, the server operator might even give the
client a choice: if there was a previous contact, it is SSH-nouveau,
otherwise it is SSL-nouveau. And the users who are about to order
a $34.95 book from Amazon just click through, and those that are
about to overthrow, by blood and iron, the oppressive, dictatorial
government of Greater Horribilia actually know what the hell is
going on, and act with prudence commensurate to their calling...
Absolute nirvana!

@_subject: Re: [cryptography] How are expired code-signing certs revoked? 
same here.
But I do understand something about the code creation, dissemination
and the trust between code creator and code user ("primary parties"),
and the role of the operating system vendor (a "tertiary party") as
an intermediary between the code creator and the code user.
With that said, I propose that "code signing" and then enforcing some
kind of "use sanctioning" protocol by the operating system vendor is
an idiotic idea, and fortunately one that has been proven as completely
impractical and ill-aligned with the interest of the two primary parties, and thus continually rejected in practice.
What should be "signed" and "tusted" (or not trusted) is not the code,
but the channel by which the code is distributed.
