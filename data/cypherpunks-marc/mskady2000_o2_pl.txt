@_subject: RE:I WANT TO INVEST IN YOUR COUNTRY 
RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE IS HIGHLY NEED
I am very sure that this mail will bring lots of surprises and uriosity to you since there was no previous correspondence before now between us.
I am the wife of Late Mr Akhmad Kadyrov,The President of Chechnya,who was killed in a bomb attack on may 9th early this year in a parade ground. My husband told me before his death that he has a deposit of $40m which he deposited in a bank overseas and handed to me all the documents which my lawyer has confirmed with the bank. Right now I am looking for an Investor who will help me to invest the total sum in the west and after which I will relocate to your country.
The security situation in Chechnya does not warrant me to do much from here; therefore I have designated my family lawyer who will coordinate every aspect of the fund transfer and the investment with your assistance.
I am ready to concede up to 20% of the funds to you as your share if you will help me to pull the funds and invest it in your country which has a stable economy. Upon receipt of your acceptance letter, I will introduce you to my family lawyer who will instruct you  on how the transfer can be done in the shortest possible time. You can mail me through my personal
email address:mrskady
Awaiting your Urgent response.
