OK, I (quite happily) stand corrected about why Microsoft

I'm pretty sure that you are answering the question
"Why did Microsoft buy Connectix?"[1]  -- the answer
was not, in other words, to screw Mac OS X users
but to break the conundrum Ballmer finds himself
in where the road forks towards (1) fix the security
problem but lose backward compatibility, or (2) keep
the backward compatibility but never fix the problem.
His Board would prefer (2), the annuity of locked-in
users, but it forces a bet that software liability
never happens.  Fixing the problem, for which the
calls grow more strident daily, puts the desktop
platform into play even more than it is now as
it asks the users (who, having lost compatibility,
thus have nothing to lose) to marry Redmond a
second time.  A VM-cures-all strategy is then
an attempt to avoid having to choose between (1)
and (2) by breaking backward compatibility for
new things but bridging the old things with a
magic box that both preserves the annuity revenue
stream from locked-in users while it keeps the
liability bar at bay.
Or so I think.

This means that once a particular signed binary has been detected
 as being malware the virus scanner can extract the signing
 certificate and know that anything else that contains that
 particular certificate will also be malware, with the certificate
 providing a convenient fixed signature string for virus scanners
 to look for.
One would assume that the effort to get such a signing
certificate would persuade the bad team to use that cert
for targeted attacks, not broadcast ones, in which case
you would be damned lucky to find it in a place where you

The "dark web" services used by criminals will continue to evolve in an
attempt to evade authorities, the UK's cybercrime boss has warned.
Last week, notorious drugs market place the Silk Road was shut down
after a lengthy investigation.
Andy Archibald, interim head of the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU),
said officers identified individuals who were using the site.
But he said new methods were needed to keep up with the threat.
"[Online anonymity service] Tor evolves, and will resecure itself," Mr
Archibald told the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones.
"The success we've had may not necessarily mean that by the same routes
and same approaches we can get into other criminal forums.
"We have to continually probe and identify those forums and then seek to
infiltrate them and use other tools.
"It's not simply a case of because we were able to infiltrate Tor on
this occasion that we'll be able to do it next time around as well."
Mr Archibald's comments came as the NCCU announced its first conviction.

touches on what can and cannot be deleted as a matter of
routine.  It is not simple, and, if your are the General
Counsel, then advising your firm to keep everything
looks safer than doing any deletion even if deletion
were to be done by way of some set of instructions that
are airtight.
The (2003) Zubulake v. UBS Warburg case is the precedential
one.  In one of the several rulings, there is this passage:
   Once a party reasonably anticipates litigation, it must suspend
   its routine document retention/destruction policy and put in
   place a "litigation hold" to ensure the preservation of relevant
   documents.
That has created a focus on the "reasonable anticipation
of litigation" phrase such that most large firms, to my
admittedly incomplete knowledge, have concluded that as
they will be sued over very nearly anything hence they
should keep very nearly everything lest the deletion of
data, even if routine and commonsensical, be found by
some Court to be willful spoilation of evidence that the
firm should have expected would be crucial to some
plaintiff's claim at some future date.  Fast forward to

Eleven years before he became the fourth President of the United
States, James Madison said that:
   Perhaps it is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home
   is to be charged to provisions against danger, real or pretended,
   from abroad.
One wonders how Madison would feel about an interconnected world
where "abroad" has so thoroughly lost its meaning, at least with
respect to Internet-dependent critical infrastructure if not national
frontiers.  My guess is that Madison would decide that the Internet
is, per se, "abroad."

Thinking out loud, if Quality Software Services was selected
for this most visible effort, then they must have a track
record with Federal agencies.
And they do (read, they're wired).  One (only) example:
  Quality Software Services, Inc. Wins $109.93 Million Federal Contract
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services
  Jun 20 12
  Quality Software Services, Inc. won a federal contract valued at
  up to $109,926,956 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
  Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Baltimore,
  for enterprise identity management services under the American
  Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
So they are in the identity management services game, which
means that they already have your number, so to speak.  And
are pre-existing contractors to Health & Human Services.
Yet more searching discovers that all the key management
personnel have TS clearances, but the firm seems to never
have had TS contracts, so one can argue that the clearances
were gifts for friends.

The Internet is not controlled, i.e., there is a power vacuum

system of software vendors by using the Treasury of the United
States to simply corner the world market in vulnerabilities and
exploits and to concommitantly release them to the public -- the
moral equivalent of administering an unproven chemotherapy for an
otherwise terminal cancer.
That proposal originally appeared in an article that I did for CNAS

be ready buyers (which there are), so the question is whether the
buying and selling is to be a black market or a white.  In truth,
I was focusing on a side effect of the USG having an unassailable
presence in a white market -- that there is some chance that we
could collapse the black market, not by outbidding it but by implying
that we had motivated the finding of vulnerabilities to such a level
that even if one searcher was able to find a vulnerability it would
not be long before some other searcher found it, too.  By cutting
the shelf-life of an unused but known vulnerability down to near
zero, we would cripple the stockpiling of weapons.  All of which,
to repeat, comes with my ironclad requirement that vulns found be
made public.  Otherwise, and as one would certainly imagine, buying
a lot of them at high prices only makes more get found such that
in a black-only market those vulns will presumaby be both sold and
re-sold to self-compartmentalized buyers.  ["We" learned only this
past week that the FBI is now buying for offensive purposes
I am also on the record that Stuxnet was a Godsend insofar as it
proved by demonstration that mutual assured destruction is possible,
though one must quickly acknowledge that, unlike a missile with the
Kremlin's name on it, cyberweapons with understood-in-advance
collateral damage do not grow on trees.  (Website on which it
originally appeared has disappeared; a mirror is at
In October, 2012, I spoke with a recently retired gentleman who had
been at the top of NSA's threat evaluation wing.  I asked him then
what he would be worrying about if he were still on the job.  He
said "Today I'd be worrying about the maker community and especially
the drone crowd.  Tomorrow I'd worry about do-it-yourself bio."
These are by no means crazy answers.
All of which comes back to your Home Invasion 2.0 work (I broke
discipline and turned on Javascript just to get it).  There is an
enormous attack surface growing there, just as you say.  Electric
meters that report back everything are quintessential privacy
destroying even if they are being mandated for "green" reasons.
And so forth -- I'll restrain myself from enumerating all the things
of that sort, though a cpunks dictionary of such would be an useful
thing jointly to build.
Which brings us back to the NSA.  Their job description is to never
miss a needle in any haystack.  Haystacks are bigger than ever, and
those who control the needles are ever more powerful -- both being
side effects of the growth in power that is buried in cyberspace.
If you are obliged to miss nothing while the cardinality of the
things you might miss is growing at an accelerating rate, your only
choice is to capture everything.  Only when you have total surveillance
is it possible to say that the absence of evidence is the evidence
of absence.  What "we" need to do is tell our leaders that we do
not want their protections, that we will bloody well take care of
ourselves even if down that path lies the occasional loss of a major
city.  One is again reminded of Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor, is
one not?

Yesterday's letter to alumni from MIT President Reif
   ________________________________________________________________
   Dear MIT Alumni,
   This evening, I sent the following message to the campus MIT
   community.  Because I know that you care very much about the
   welfare of our students, I thought you might be interested to
   see it, too.
   Sincerely,
   L. Rafael Reif
   __________________________________________________________________
   To the members of the MIT community:
   I am writing to address a problem that a group of MIT students
   currently face but that concerns all of us, because it highlights
   issues central to sustaining the creative culture of MIT.
   The students in question are the creators of Tidbit, a
   proof-of-concept code for a novel Bitcoin-harvesting strategy.
   After Tidbit won the "most innovative" award in a recent hackathon,
   the State Attorney General of New Jersey demanded that the
   students turn over a sweeping set of documents, code and
   information--a surprising and difficult turn of events for the
   Tidbit team.
   I am grateful to all those who have written to me to express
   their concern about this situation, and I want to make it clear
   that the students who created Tidbit have the full and enthusiastic
   support of MIT. Chancellor Cindy Barnhart and Provost Marty
   Schmidt met with the students yesterday. They and General Counsel
   Greg Morgan also spoke with the Electronic Frontier Foundation
   (EFF), which is providing to the students, pro bono, the independent
   legal representation that they need. We will remain in close
   coordination with the students and the EFF to offer assistance
   in the legal proceedings.
   Beyond this specific case, I believe we should provide our student
   inventors and entrepreneurs with a resource for independent legal
   advice, singularly devoted to their interests and rights. I have
   asked the Provost, Chancellor and General Counsel to develop and
   submit to me a specific proposal for creating such a resource,
   which will add an essential new strength to MIT's innovation
   ecosystem.
   When the MIT community works together, we spot problems, analyze
   them and solve them. Let's solve this one together.
   Sincerely,
   L. Rafael Reif

   The Latest Heist: US Quietly Snatches the Ukraine's Gold Reserves
   March 21, 2014    As the dust settles in Kiev, another money trail has been
   revealed...  According to reports out of Kiev (see links below),
   the US has quietly transfers 33 tons of Ukrainian gold out of
   the country and back to vaults in the US. Presumably, this
   sovereign wealth transfer would be counted as partial "collateral"
   for a fresh round of IMF, US FED, and ECB paper debt that is
   currently being organised for dumping into the Ukraine's economic
   black hole.
   Multiple inquiries to US Federal Reserve administrators into the
   location of the Ukraine's gold have been met with the proverbial
   `pass the buck', making tracking and tracking the final resting
   place of these 33 tonnes very difficult indeed - but one can
   expect that the NY Fed is probably the institution who has
   masterminded this financial heist.
   Note how gold flows into New York, but has difficulty flowing
   out of US private banking hands as is the case with the
   `confiscation' of Germany's gold. Numerous attempts by Bundesbank
   to repatriate its gold reserves have been met with a brick wall,
   and to date, Germany has only recovered a miniscule 5 tonnes
   directly from the NY Fed - out of the total 674 tonnes (an
   additional 32 tonnes were recovered via French central bank).
   It's worth pointing out here that when NATO sacked Libya in 2011,
   one of the first items that came into question was the gold in
   Libya's state-run central bank. Prior to the NATO takeover of
   that country, Libya had one of the highest per capita gold
   reserves in the world, alongside Lebanon, giving Libya a distinct
   advantage should it carry out former Libyan leader Muammar
   Muhammad al-Gaddafi's long-term financial transition to a
   gold-backed Libyan Dinar. As you can imagine, this is no longer
   the case in Tripoli.
   Additionally, like Libya, both Syria and Iran are two of the
   world's last remaining nation states who both have state-run
   central banks and gold reserves which fall outside of the world's
   private central banking syndicate.
   Needless to say, you can see an obvious pattern emerging here.
And the story continues...
   The Big Lie + What Happened To Ukraine's Gold?
   By PM Fund Manager Dave Kranzler Investment Research Dynamics
   The Big Lie is that Central Banks don't care about gold. Nothing
   could be further from the truth.  Ben Bernanke, more than once,
   claimed that he didn't understand gold.  When Ron Paul asked
   Bernanke in front of Congress why Central Banks own gold if it's
   irrelevant, Bernanke flippantly suggested that it was out of
   tradition. In both cases Bernanke was lying and he knew it.
   In comparison, Greenspan seemed to have some respect for the
   laws of economics and - at least that I can recall - never would
   outright state that gold was not an economic factor.   Greenspan
   lied as much as Bernanke did about everything else but he never
   committed himself to lie about gold.  Most of you have probably
   read Greenspan's 1966 essay, "Gold and Economic Freedom" (linked).
   I have read it several times because it explains as well as
   anything out there why gold works as a currency and why
   Government-issued fiat currency does not.
   What I find amazing about The Big Lie about Central Banks and
   gold is that if gold really is considered to be irrelevant, the
   how come Central Banks - especially the Fed - are so secretive
   about their gold storage and trading activities?  What's even
   more amazing is that no one other than Ron Paul and GATA asks
   them about this. Think about it.  GATA spent a lot of money on
   legal fees attempting to get the Fed to publicly disclose its
   records related to the Fed's gold activities. The Fed spent even
   more money denying GATA's quest. And how come the Fed won't
   submit to a public, independent audit of its gold vaults?
   This brings me to the issue of the Ukraine's gold. According to
   public records, the Government of Ukraine owns 33 tonnes of gold
   that was being safekept in Ukraine. Last week a Ukrainian newspaper
   reported that acting PM Arseny Yatsenyuk ordered the transfer
   of that gold to the United States. The actual report is here:
   LINK. Jesse's Cafe Americain provided a translated version here:
   LINK.
   On the assumption that the report is true, and so far I have not
   seen any commentary or articles suggesting it is not true, the
   biggest question is, how come the U.S. has absolutely no problem
   loading up and transporting 33 tonnes of gold from Ukraine to
   the U.S. but seems to have difficulty loading up and transporting
   any of Germany's gold from New York to Berlin? And how come the
   U.S. and Ukraine seem to care about that gold at all, if indeed
   gold is irrelevant? It would seem that it would be a lot less
   expensive  and logistically complicated just to have the U.S.
   military post a few armed guards around the gold if they're
   worried about theft. On the other hand, I'm sure Putin would be
   happy to buy the gold from Ukraine.
   What makes the story even more interesting is that GATA's Chris
   Powell has spent considerable time trying to get an answer to
   the question of whether or not the U.S. has taken custody of
   Ukraine's gold. When he queried the NY Fed, they responded with:
   "A spokesman for the New York Fed said simply: "Any inquiry
   regarding gold accounts should be directed to the account holder.
   You may want to contact the National Bank of Ukraine to discuss
   this report" (LINK).
   After trying for two days to get an answer from the U.S. State
   Department, they finally responded by referring him to the NY
   Fed (LINK).
   The final piece in verifying that the report is true is deflection
   from Ukraine. Mr. Powell has queried the National Bank of Ukraine,
   the Ukrainian Embassy in DC, and the Ukrainian mission to the
   UN in NYC.  Crickets. As Chris states the case:
   "The difficulty in getting a straight answer here is pretty good
   evidence that the Ukrainian gold indeed has been sent to the
   United States."
   Unfortunately, it is likely that the citizens of Ukraine will
   end up paying the same price for allowing the U.S. to "safekeep"
   their sovereign gold. That price is the comforting knowledge
   that their gold has been delivered safely to vaults in China
   under U.S./UK bullion bank contractual delivery obligations,
   where it will be locked away for centuries.

His relationship with President Obama may well result in Obama's
Presidential Library coming to U Chicago.  Maybe that is comforting.
Maybe that feeds your conclusions about how broad The Conspiracy is.
All of which is irrelevant except that you can take my word, if you
like, that he is neither a pushover nor a hired hand.  The same,
of course, can be said for all the members of Obama's special
commission.  In my view, the question on the table is means and
ends.  I observe an American public that is trending toward ever
more risk aversion.  If my observation is correct, then you know
well that it will concentrate power because risk aversion begets a
demand for absolute safety requires absolute power and absolute
power corrupts absolutely.
If I may quote another man I hold in personal regard, Joel Brenner's
(Google him, too) insight is this:
   During the Cold War, our enemies were few and we knew who they
   were.  The technologies used by Soviet military and intelligence
   agencies were invented by those agencies.  Today, our adversaries
   are less awesomely powerful than the Soviet Union, but they are
   many and often hidden.  That means we must find them before we
   can listen to them.  Equally important, virtually every government
   on Earth, including our own, has abandoned the practice of relying
   on government-developed technologies.  Instead they rely on
   commercial off-the-shelf, or COTS, technologies.  They do it
   because no government can compete with the head-spinning advances
   emerging from the private sector, and no government can afford
   to try.  When NSA wanted to collect intelligence on the Soviet
   government and military, the agency had to steal or break the
   encryption used by them and nobody else.  The migration to COTS
   changed that.  If NSA now wants to collect against a foreign
   general's or terorist's communications, it must break the same
   encryption you and I use on our own devices...  That's why NSA
   would want to break the encryption used on every one of those
   media.  If it couldn't, any terrorist in Chicago, Kabul, or
   Cologne would simply use a Blackberry or send messages on Yahoo!
   But therein lies a policy dilemma, because NSA could decrypt
   almost any private conversation.  The distinction between
   capabilities and actual practices is more critical than ever...
   Like it or not, the dilemma can be resolved only through oversight
   mechanisms that are publicly understood and trusted -- but are
   not themselves ... transparent.
I fear we are on the edge of a rat-hole here.  I forwarded Geoff's
remarks as they are relevant, timely, and speak to the absence of
simplistic nostrums in such matters, both because of the rising
popular / political demand for comfort-and-safety and because the
technologies that those charged with delivering comfort and safety
use are COTS technologies.  And dual use.  Personally, I think of
surveillance as just another tax, which you may safely assume is
said through clenched libertarian cum Tea Party teeth.

@_subject: Geoff Stone, Obama's Review Group 
[ disclaimer, Geoff Stone is a friend of mine ]
What I Told the NSA
   Because of my service on the President's Review Group last fall,
   which made recommendations to the president about NSA surveillance
   and related issues, the NSA invited me to speak today to the NSA
   staff at the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, about my
   work on the Review Group and my perceptions of the NSA. Here,
   in brief, is what I told them:
     From the outset, I approached my responsibilities as a member
     of the Review Group with great skepticism about the NSA. I am
     a long-time civil libertarian, a member of the National Advisory
     Council of the ACLU, and a former Chair of the Board of the
     American Constitution Society. To say I was skeptical about
     the NSA is, in truth, an understatement.
     I came away from my work on the Review Group with a view of
     the NSA that I found quite surprising. Not only did I find
     that the NSA had helped to thwart numerous terrorist plots
     against the United States and its allies in the years since
     9/11, but I also found that it is an organization that operates
     with a high degree of integrity and a deep commitment to the
     rule of law.
     Like any organization dealing with extremely complex issues,
     the NSA on occasion made mistakes in the implementation of its
     authorities, but it invariably reported those mistakes upon
     discovering them and worked conscientiously to correct its
     errors. The Review Group found no evidence that the NSA had
     knowingly or intentionally engaged in unlawful or unauthorized
     activity. To the contrary, it has put in place carefully-crafted
     internal proceduresto ensure that it operates within the bounds
     of its lawful authority.
     This is not to say that the NSA should have had all of the
     authorities it was given. The Review Group found that many of
     the programs undertaken by the NSA were highly problematic and
     much in need of reform. But the responsibility for directing
     the NSA to carry out those programs rests not with the NSA,
     but with the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Foreign
     Intelligence Surveillance Court, which authorized those programs
     -- sometimes without sufficient attention to the dangers they
     posed to privacy and civil liberties. The NSA did its job --
     it implemented the authorities it was given.
     It gradually became apparent to me that in the months after
     Edward Snowden began releasing information about the government's
     foreign intelligence surveillance activities, the NSA was being
     severely -- and unfairly -- demonized by its critics. Rather
     than being a rogue agency that was running amok in disregard
     of the Constitution and laws of the United States, the NSA was
     doing its job.  It pained me to realize that the hard-working,
     dedicated, patriotic employees of the NSA, who were often
     working for far less pay than they could have earned in the
     private sector because they were determined to help protect
     their nation from attack, were being castigated in the press
     for the serious mistakes made, not by them, but by Presidents,
     the Congress, and the courts.
     Of course, "I was only following orders" is not always an
     excuse.  But in no instance was the NSA implementing a program
     that was so clearly illegal or unconstitutional that it would
     have been justified in refusing to perform the functions
     assigned to it by Congress, the President, and the Judiciary.
     Although the Review Group found that many of those programs
     need serious re-examination and reform, none of them was so
     clearly unlawful that it would have been appropriate for the
     NSA to refuse to fulfill its responsibilities.
     Moreover, to the NSA's credit, it was always willing to engage
     the Review Group in serious and candid discussions about the
     merits of its programs, their deficiencies, and the ways in
     which those programs could be improved. Unlike some other
     entities in the intelligence community and in Congress, the
     leaders of the NSA were not reflexively defensive, but were
     forthright, engaged, and open to often sharp questions about
     the nature and implementation of its programs.
     To be clear, I am not saying that citizens should trust the
     NSA.  They should not. Distrust is essential to effective
     democratic governance. The NSA should be subject to constant
     and rigorous review, oversight, scrutiny, and checks and
     balances. The work it does, however important to the safety
     of the nation, necessarily poses grave dangers to fundamental
     American values, particularly if its work is abused by persons
     in positions of authority. If anything, oversight of the NSA
     -- especially by Congress -- should be strengthened. The future
     of our nation depends not only on the NSA doing its job, but
     also on the existence of clear, definitive, and carefully
     enforced rules and restrictions governing its activities.
     In short, I found, to my surprise, that the NSA deserves the
     respect and appreciation of the American people. But it should
     never, ever, be trusted.

 Countering trusting trust through diverse double-compiling
An air force evaluation of Multics, and Ken Thompson's famous Turing
award lecture "reflections on trusting trust, " showed that compilers
can be subverted to insert malicious Trojan horses into critical
software, including themselves. If this attack goes undetected, even
complete analysis of a system's source code can not find the malicious
code that is running, and methods for detecting this particular attack
are not widely known. This paper describes a practical technique, termed
diverse double-compiling (DDC), that detects this attack and some
compiler defects as well. Simply recompile the source code twice: once
with a second (trusted) compiler, and again using the result of the
first compilation. If the result is bit-for-bit identical with the
untrusted binary, then the source code accurately represents the binary.
This technique has been mentioned informally, but its issues and
ramifications have not been identified or discussed in a peer-reviewed
work, nor has a public demonstration been made. This paper describes the
technique, justifies it, describes how to overcome practical challenges,
and demonstrates it.

It depends on whether you believe that a promise of procedurally

The answer is "no" if your definition of privacy is the absence of
observability.  The answer is "yes" if your definition of privacy
is the absence of identifiability.
Technical progress in image acquisition guarantees observability
pretty much everywhere now.  Standoff biometrics are delivering
multi-factor identifiability at ever greater distances.  We will
soon live in a society where identity is not an assertion like "My

Lavabit Loses Contempt Of Court Appeal
Failure to hand over encryption keys could land Lavabit founder Levison
with hefty fines
On April 17, 2014 by Thomas Brewster
Lavabit, the email service once used by whistleblower Edward
Snowden, has lost an appeal against a contempt of court ruling
that he delayed the US Government's attempts to gather information
by refusing to hand over encryption keys.  the email service,
which has since closed, was eventually forced to comply anyway.
The US government asked for SSL keys to look at the metadata
(dates and other details of communications) for a specific Lavabit
user, believed to be Snowden, The service's founder Ladar Levison
at first refused, and when forced to comply, provided the keys
printed in a tiny typeface.
The court ruled that Lavabit had not followed correct procedures
in its initial hearings, and had not raised a specific challenge
to the district court's authority under the so-called "pen/trap
statute".  Levinson could now be fined for contempt.
"Levison's statement to the district court simply reflected his
personal angst over complying with the pen/trap order, not his
present appellate argument that questions whether the district
court possessed the authority to act at all," read a statement
from the fourth US circuit court of appeals Judge G Steven Agee.
"Arguments raised in a trial court must be specific and in line
with those raised on appeal."
The case stems back to June last year, when the US government
sought to acquire private keys for SSL encrypted traffic of a
specific Lavabit user, thought to be Snowden. Officials sought
to put a tap on the communications of that target to collect
Levison, when approached by FBI officials, refused to hand over
the keys, which eventually led to the contempt of court charge.
According to the court filing denying his appeal, Levison suggested
he could provide the content the government was after, rather
than using their interception tools. The government decline the
offer, saying it needed real-time acquisition of the target's
A device to intercept traffic was installed as part of the
pen/trap order, but could not gather usable information as the
encryption keys had not been provided.
Officials did eventually get the keys in August 2013, however.
"The government sought penalties of $5,000 a day until Lavabit
provided the encryption keys to the government. The district
court granted the motion for sanctions that day. Two days later,
Levison provided the keys to the government. By that time, six
weeks of data regarding the target had been lost," the court
ruling read.
Levison could now be fined thousands of dollars.

   For quite some time, it has been apparent that the announcement of the
   [33]NIST Cybersecurity Framework would be a seminal event.  Though
   couched as a voluntary program, many expected that [34]the Framework
   would become the de facto ground for liability.  After all, if the
   National Institute for Standards and Technology has determined a
   baseline framework for optimal security in the cyber domain, [35]what
   could be more negligent than failing to meet that minimum standard?
   Unsurprisingly, the penny has begun to drop.  Not, as one might have
   expected, in private sector tort suits, but in public sector regulatory
   action.  Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission[36]
   announced its intention to conduct an examination of the cybersecurity
   of 50 broker-dealers and investment advisers subject to its
   jurisdiction.  The [37]questionnaire derives much of its content from
   the NIST Framework--so now the Framework will be the likely potential
   ground for regulatory action.
   How ironic then, that in the same week, [38]the GAO issued a report
   critical of the SEC for its own [39]lack of adequate cybersecurity and
   oversight.  Perhaps the cobbler's children don't have any shoes ....

Jim Breyer, founder and CEO at Breyer Capital and a partner in Accel
Partners, expects the search engine giant to join Facebook in
gobbling up smaller companies and continuing to grow rapidly.
"The environment we're in now is probably the most interesting

The rise of the first trillion-dollar companies was one of a handful

early partner in video-sharing site Vine.
She said companies that can make it easier to make videos will do
"The technology limitations just dealing with getting something
from your phone to the server is still a difficult hurdle," Fisher
said. "The sky's the limit for video."

@_author: when there was no ice at the poles 
@_subject: Re: Of Sealand, corp, and country [was: nation-state] 
For the purpose of this note, I'll stipulate that global
warming is happening without arguing why.  The question
for science would be whether it has a positive feedback
loop, as it would if rising temperature releases, say, 10%
of the carbon locked in permafrost.  Given the wild temp
excursions in geologic time scales -- "snowball earth" vs.
the Cretaceous (when there was no ice at the poles) -- it
is reasonable to imagine that some excursions have a phase
where the feedback is positive and thus if the temp heads
either north or south its velociity will, for natural reasons,
accelerate as the excursion grows more extreme.  That implies
that the present time is an unstable equilibrium, thus our
imapct, whatever it is, seems likely to be an initiator or
a potentiator but not a cause in the classical sense of,
say, a dose-response curve.
Put differently, I don't believe that we (humans) can push
the climate to a place it has not been before, but we can
change the clock.  One might then ask what government has
your confidence in its being capable of managing a comprehensive
program of compensatory global cooling and what powers would
be required to enforce same?
What this topic has to do with this list is unobvious.

Starting with the Federal Register as found at
   converting that to
   geer.tinho.net/federal.register.xls
and making the assumption that the page count in the Federal Register
has a linear relationship with the regulatory burden imposed by the
Federal government (more precisely, that the percentage of pages
that are actual regulations is relatively constant hence the trend
line is a fair representation, per se), we have, in turn, this
   geer.tinho.net/federal.register.tiff
Taking, then, the 4-year moving average of the number of new pages,
we can score Presidents (omitting Pres. Obama as his term is as yet
unended) by the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in regulatory
burden during their time in office, first in chronologic order
FDR   19.7%
HST   -2.2%
DDE    1.3%
JFK    5.2%
LBJ    6.1%
RMN    5.8%
GRF   17.6%
JEC    7.4%
RWR   -3.6%
GHB    2.7%
WJC    3.2%
GWB    0.9%
and then sorted highest (most regulating) to lowest (least regulating)
FDR   19.7%
GRF   17.6%
JEC    7.4%
LBJ    6.1%
RMN    5.8%
JFK    5.2%
WJC    3.2%
GHB    2.7%
DDE    1.3%
GWB    0.9%
HST   -2.2%
RWR   -3.6%
This can be further collapsed to the party level where the CAGR
under Democratic Presidencies has been 6.22% and under Republican
Presidencies has been 2.63% for an overall shared CAGR of 4.53%,
meaning that had the Democrats held the Presidency for the full 78
years there would be 46.0% more regulations than now obtain while
had the Republicans held the Presidency for the full 78 years there
would be 78.6% fewer regulations than now obtain, corresponding to
an 11.5 year doubling time for total regulatory burden under
Democratic Presidencies versus a 26.7 year doubling time under
Republican Presidencies.
The entirety of the above aligns with Harvard Law Professor Harvey
Silverglate's estimate that the average American commits three
felonies a day
      In sum, selective enforcement of the putative rule base is a
structural inevitability given the observed rate of growth in that
rule base.  To return to a rule of law requires that the number of
laws be reduced.

How Mt. Gox Debacle Won Over a Bitcoin Convert
SAN MATEO, Calif. -- One event that inspired venture capitalist Tim
Draper to amass a huge stash of bitcoin was the same one that turned
other investors away.
The Silicon Valley veteran says that he was so heartened to see
bitcoin withstand the failure of Japanese virtual-currency exchange
Mt. Gox in February that he decided to bid for nearly 30,000 bitcoin
that were auctioned by the U.S. government in June.
Continued bitcoin use by merchants and others after investors lost
money in Mt. Gox "made me realize that there is a need for this,"
Mr. Draper said in a recent interview. "It is so important to people
that they were willing to put up with that."
Mr. Draper won all the bitcoin, making the co-founder of venture-capital
firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson one of the world's largest holders of
bitcoin. Thursday, Mr. Draper will try to increase his pile by
bidding in another government auction of 50,000 bitcoin.
The 56-year-old Mr. Draper is one of bitcoin's biggest advocates
even though the price is down about 60% in the past year amid
concerns about the Mt. Gox collapse, looming regulation and the
stigma that the virtual currency is a haven for illicit activity.
This week, Mr. Draper's bitcoin pile was worth about $11 million,
down from roughly $17 million in June, based on the CoinDesk price
Like many bitcoin enthusiasts, Mr. Draper compares the current state
of the fledgling industry with the early days of the Internet. At
Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson, he backed Internet companies from Hotmail
and Skype to Paperless Post, an online invitation company
Mr. Draper is one of a number of well-known investors who are pouring
money into bitcoin, which was originally dominated by technology
geeks and libertarians. Other bitcoin investors include Internet
pioneer Marc Andreessen ; Virgin Group founder Richard Branson ;
and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twins who are best known for
battling Mark Zuckerberg over ownership stakes of Facebook Inc.
Launched in 2009, bitcoin is an online currency that isnt backed
by a central bank or government. It is created on computers; bought,
sold and traded on exchanges; and stored in virtual wallets.
A growing number of merchants are accepting bitcoin for payment,
in part because it helps them avoid fees and other costs associated
with credit cards, debit cards, checks or cash.
Bitcoin's increased awareness and popularity hasn't resolved price
volatility that has roiled the virtual currency over the past year.
The price of a bitcoin soared to more than $1,100 last year, but
it has been sliding ever since. On Monday, bitcoin was trading at
$377.90 on the CoinDesk price index of major exchanges.
In an interview, Mr. Draper shrugs off the recent drop in bitcoin
prices. He has recently predicted that the price will rise to $10,000
in three years.
"I am looking at this as a great long-term opportunity," he says,
adding that he checks the price only every two or three weeks.
Mr. Draper, working through Bitcoin exchange startup Vaurum, was
one of 45 bidders in the auction conducted by the U.S. Marshals
Service auction in June. The government seized the bitcoin last
year when it raided Silk Road, an online black market.
Mr. Draper hasn't disclosed the price of his bid, made when the
market price of the virtual currency was roughly $580.
"When you win an auction, you have mixed feelings because you know
that means you paid the most," he said with a chuckle.
Still, he says he is confident with the purchase because he wouldn't
have been able to amass such a stash in the open market, which is
thinly traded and volatile.
That thin market is one of the things that concerns Mark T. Williams,
a Boston University finance professor who says the recent bitcoin
forays made by big investors such as Mr. Draper aren't enough to
make it thrive. "The probability of success is low, but if it does
hit, the reward will be very large," he said.
Mr. Draper says his interest in virtual currencies goes back 20
years, when a business associate described his sons fascination
with an online game that allowed players to buy items for virtual
characters with virtual cash.
Outside of bitcoin, Mr. Draper has also plowed money into job-hunting
startup Jobs Inc., Tesla Motors , and Xpert Financial, an online
marketplace for pre-IPO companies.
In 2012, Mr. Draper and other investors put a $500,000 investment
into CoinLab, a bitcoin business incubator. He made his investment
through Draper Associates, an entity that puts money into new
He has also put money into a $6.6 million fund that was recently
raised by his son, Adam, to support fledgling bitcoin entrepreneurs.
Mr. Draper is particularly interested in using bitcoin to speed
payments in less-developed countries. He also sees promise in using
bitcoin's underlying technology to create financial contracts that
can skirt the traditional fee structure of big banks.
"Banks are afraid to embrace bitcoin, but I'm not sure they're as
afraid as much as threatened," he says.
Mr. Draper spends much of his time building Draper University, an
eight-week entrepreneurship program that he launched last year.
The school isn't accredited, but students can pay their $9,500
tuition with bitcoin.

   The card aiming to end Nigeria's fraud problem
      Last year, the National Electronic Identity (e-ID) Card was
   launched in collaboration with MasterCard, with President Goodluck
   Jonathan the first recipient...  The smart card's Match-On-Card
   technology matches a holder's fingerprint against a profile
   stored in the embedded chip...  The card is also a travel document,
   conforming to the same standards as international passports. It
   contains electronic identification information, as well as Public

   signing, non-repudiation and encryption.  The eID card contains
   users' biometric data, including fingerprints...  Fully 70% of
   adult Nigerians do not have a formal bank account...
again bring up the tradeoffs between all-in-one functionality versus
segregation of duties.  I personally don't want one technology to
rule them all, but I have many choices and I know how to make them.
Others, not so much.

the Nigerian solution and want to comment on how risk management
tradeoffs were evaluated?  To me (the guy living in a world of

  That way lies the police state.  And for that, there is no excuse,  because we were all (*) alive and aware when the Berlin Wall came down.

sure that in the fullness of time enforcement will wane.  If
an agreement calls for appointment of an oversight board, then
you can be sure that in the fullness of time the appointment
process will yield not fire-in-the-belly citizen activists
but apparatchiks.  If an agreement calls for an evaluation
five years hence as to whether the course of action was or was
not producing the results that it was promised to produce,
then you can be sure that in the fullness of time such review
will be pro forma, vapid, innocuous, and self-congratulatory,
if it is done at all.  A government's word cannot be trusted

more data it is given, the more its data utilization efficiency
matters.  The more its data utilization efficiency matters, the
more its algorithms will evolve to opaque operation.  Above some
threshold of dependence on such an algorithm in practice, there
can be no going back.  As such, if data science wishes to be
genuinely useful, preserving algorithm interrogatability despite
efficiency-seeking, self-driven evolution is the research grade
problem now on the table.  If science does not pick this up,
then Lessig's characterization of code as law is fulfilled.
In short, features drive.  They drive because of democratic
principles evidenced by immensely rapid uptake.  They rely upon a
user base that is forever "barefoot and pregnant."  And it is
increasingly difficult to opt out of features without opting out
of society altogether.  As there is zero difference between
"personalization" and "targeting" beyond the intent of the
algorithm, those who don't accept features will be adjudged
anomalous, and we already treat anomaly detection as the
sine qua non of public safety.

Well, now we are into dueling Supreme Court cases; see
   Kyllo v. United States (2001)
   Despite the Court's attempt to draw a line that is "not only
   firm but also bright," ante, at 12, the contours of its new rule
   are uncertain because its protection apparently dissipates as
   soon as the relevant technology is "in general public use," ante,
   at 6-7. Yet how much use is general public use is not even hinted
   at by the Court's opinion, which makes the somewhat doubtful
   assumption that the thermal imager used in this case does not
   satisfy that criterion. In any event, putting aside its lack
   of clarity, this criterion is somewhat perverse because it seems
   likely that the threat to privacy will grow, rather than recede,
   as the use of intrusive equipment becomes more readily available.
That reads, to me, that what the public adopts limits what I can

Vincent van Gogh's ear is nearly as famous as his jaw-dropping
Starry Night. Though its final resting place may never be found --
as the legend goes, he severed off part of his ear and then gave
it to a prostitute, museumgoers in New York can get a look at the
next best thing. ArtNet's Sarah Cascone reports that a living replica
of van Gogh's ear, created using the artist's DNA, is now on display
at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York City.
The ear is the gruesome brainchild of Diemut Strebe, a conceptual
artist who partnered with scientists from MIT and other universities
to create a copy of van Gogh's ear. Using DNA extracted from a stamp
licked by the artist, as well as cell samples collected from van
Gogh's great-great-grandnephew, Strebe and team created "Sugababe,"
an artificially grown ear suspended in a clear gel.
Visitors don't have to merely look at the ear'they can talk into
it, too. On her website, Strebe writes that "the input sound is
connected to a computer processor, using a software program to
generate simulated nerve impulses from the sound signal in real
time. They mimic sounds recorded from an electrode inserted into
the auditory nerve, when firing." Noam Chomsky was the first person
to speak into the ear after it debuted in Germany last year.
In a 2014 story about the bizarre art project, Cascone writes that
the ear is "just one of a limited edition." Neither van Gogh's
relatives nor the Dutch museum that bears his name want copies of
their own.
If "Sugababe" is a slightly macabre commentary on fame and art,
it's also a tribute to a world-famous artistic body part. It's not
certain what actually happened to van Gogh's ear: though he supposedly
gave it to a prostitute during a mental breakdown, recent scholarship
suggests that it was actually cut off by Paul Gauguin during an
argument between the two artists.
Perhaps van Gogh could have benefitted from 21st-century ear
replication technology. Still, there's no telling what the painter'who
once proclaimed that the idea of exhibiting his work left him
"absolutely cold" would make of artwork inspired by one of his
darkest moments.

sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, using both enjoyment
ratings and identity scores.  Of all personality measures, sadism
showed the most robust associations with trolling and, importantly,
the relationship was specific to trolling behavior.  Enjoyment of
other online activities, such as chatting and debating, was unrelated
to sadism.  Thus cyber-trolling appears to be an Internet manifestation
of everyday sadism.

   mobile apps, such as WhatsApp, Apple Messages, and Telegram,
   which provide free worldwide communications and improved privacy
   and security. Some apps have even added end-to-end "sealed
   envelope" encryption, putting message contents out of reach of
   both law enforcement and the service providers themselves.
   Even so, there is still a great deal of data available that is
   not fully encrypted or even encrypted at all--data that allows
   for the kind of digital detective capabilities that law enforcement
   seek to catch the bad guys. It is disingenuous on all sides to
   pretend it does not.  Some call this metadata, but considering
   the volume and detail of data available, there is nothing meta
   about it. Not all of the approaches to data gathering and intercept
   are clearly legal. Many app developers (including myself) are
   actively working to defend against them and close these gaps,
   as they are often used to unjustly attack and monitor activists,
   journalists, and even estranged loved ones.
   Still, we cannot deny that they exist for now, and so, rather
   than let these data-gathering options linger in the shadows,
   I'll enumerate them here.
   1) If someone is carrying a mobile phone, their every movement,
   phone call, and use of the Internet access is being tracked and
   logged by the mobile service provider. Accessing that data often
   does not require a warrant, just a phone number and a contact
   at the phone company.
   2) Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram require users to
   register their accounts with a working telephone number. Use of
   the app is tied to this number, and to all the phone numbers of
   the people they are communicating with. See number one for what
   you can do with a list of phone numbers.
   3) The kind of encryption implemented in mainstream apps today
   is not automatic. Even in well-regarded implementations by
   WhatsApp and Apple, knowing when and how encryption is active
   and verified is unclear. It is likely possible to disable access
   to or reduce the strength of encryption on a per-user basis,
   without the user knowing.
   4) Even an end-to-end encrypted chat can be monitored if the app
   supports group chat or syncing conversations between multiple
   devices.  If you can compel the app service provider to add a
   new device to an account or participant into a group without
   notifying existing users, then you are in.
   5) Full storage encryption of smartphones is not on by default
   for Android, and only in effect on iOS when the device is powered
   off. Most of these apps are not password-protected on the device
   itself. Get access to a phone with the screen unlocked, or crack
   the screen lock app itself, and you are in. Compel the owner of
   a fingerprint-locked device to unlock it with their thumbprint,
   and you are in. Trick the user into installing (or force their
   app store to do so) a keystroke-logging keyboard or a hidden
   surveillance app and you are in.
   6) Most cloud data is only encrypted to protect it from outside
   attackers, and not from the service provider themselves. Some
   services say, "We encrypt data at rest in the cloud," but they
   mean they do so with an encryption key that they hold, not one
   the user holds. Rather than backdoor the messages in real time,
   just get access to a cloud backup of all the messages, contacts,
   calendars, photos, location data, and more that users often
   unwittingly store there.
   Whether we like it or not, the opportunities for targeted
   surveillance of digital communications are vast and deep, within
   both clearly legal and legally gray areas. I am not encouraging
   legalizing criminal hacking by the police or promoting surreptitious
   methods for infringing on freedom and privacy. In fact, I am a
   firm believer that more encryption is needed, to strengthen our
   personal privacy and defend against actual cybersecurity threats.
   Fundamentally, I hope that through deeper understanding of the
   private data that we all constantly generate and expose, there
   can be more clarity about, and less fear of, the "dark."

   Cryptsy Faces Potential Bankruptcy Over Just-Revealed 2014 Hack
   Mathew J. Schwartz (euroinfosec) o January 15, 2016
   Bitcoin Heist Steals Millions from Exchange
   Cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy, which trades bitcoins as well
   as more than 100 types of "altcoins" such as litecoin and namecoin,
   disclosed Jan. 15 that it was robbed in 2014. As a result of the
   breach, the exchange has now suspended all trades and says it
   will file for bankruptcy unless the stolen bitcoins are returned.
   Florida-based Cryptsy says the attacker stole 13,000 bitcoins,
   worth $5 million today, as well as 300,000 litecoins, worth
   $970,000 today. The exchange says the theft was not related to
   the recent phishing and distributed denial-of-service attacks
   that it's suffered. It suspects that the most recent developer
   behind Lucky7Coin - LK7 - is the culprit behind the attacks,
   based on a backdoor that it found inside its network.
   "About a year and a half ago, we were alerted ...  a reduction
   in our safe/cold wallet balances of bitcoin and litecoin, as
   well as a couple other smaller cryptocurrencies," Cryptsy says
   in a blog post. It says its investigation ultimately found that
   the developer of the Lucky7Coin cryptocurrency "had placed an
   IRC backdoor into the code of
    wallet, which allowed it to act as a sort of a Trojan, or
   command-and-control unit."
   The exchange adds: "This Trojan had likely been there for months
   before it was able to collect enough information to perform the
   attack," which was executed on July 29, 2014. A user of code-sharing
   site GitHub in March 2015 detailed that apparent backdoor in the
   Lucky7Coin IRC code, noting that it would give an attacker "the
   ability to run arbitrary commands on the victim's host."
   Cryptsy suspects that whoever originally developed Lucky7Coin
   isn't responsible for the backdoor, but rather someone named
   "Jack," who claimed to have taken over development of the
   cryptocurrency codebase and related code, and who contacted
   Cryptsy on May 22, 2014. "You're the only exchange for this coin
   and I hope you will let me take care of it. I'm responsible,"
   Jack claimed.
Message From New Lucky7Coin Developer
   [Cryptsy-720.jpg] Cryptsy says it fell for a Trojan attack
   initiated by "Jack."
Connection to Jailed 'Silk Road' Secret Service Agent
   Cryptsy is not the first exchange to have faced insolvency after
   hackers stole its bitcoins (see Bitcoin Exchange Hacked With
   Word Macro). But why didn't the exchange come forward sooner?
   Officials at Cryptsy couldn't be immediately reached for comment.
   But in the blog post, Cryptsy says it initially tried to cover
   the missing funds using its exchange profits and appears to
   suggest that everyone would have been worse off, had it gone to
   authorities, because its U.S. Secret Service contact was none
   other than Special Agent Shaun Bridges. "I think we all know
   what happened with him," the Cryptsy blog post notes.
   In August, Bridges pleaded guilty to both money laundering and
   obstruction of justice. He was accused of abusing his position
   while a member of the Secret Service's Electronic Crimes Task
   Force that was investigating the notorious darknet narcotics
   marketplace called Silk Road (see Former Secret Service Agent
   Pleads Guilty to $800K Bitcoin Theft).
   Cryptsy, which is a member of the Financial Crimes Enforcement
   Network, also says it attempted to contact the FBI Miami field
   office recently, but was redirected to the Internet Crime Complaint
   Center.  IC3, as it's also known, is run by the FBI, the National
   White Collar Crime Center and the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance;
   it deals with Internet crime complaints (see Hackers Claim FBI
   Information-Sharing Portal Breached). The exchange says it has
   yet to hear back from IC3.
Will Missing Bitcoins Come Home?
   Cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk reports that declining trading
   volumes have undercut the exchange's profits and that the exchange
   has halted trading twice in the past two weeks, blaming one of
   those outages on a phishing attack that employed users' email
   addresses and phone numbers.
   But a class-action lawsuit filed Jan. 13 against Project Investors
   - doing business as Cryptsy - and Paul Vernon, who it says is
   the founder, operator, and CEO of Cryptsy, alleges that since
   November 2015, "certain Cryptsy users started having difficulties
   and inabilities withdrawing any and all forms of currency from
   their accounts." The plaintiff, Virginia-based Jinyao Liu, "seeks
   damages based upon the unlawful conduct of defendants in denying
   account holders the ability to obtain funds in their accounts
   and in misappropriating funds held in the Cryptsy accounts,"
   according to the lawsuit.
     Thank you everyone for the patience while we get these issues
     resolved. Team is working hard and we will try to do more
     frequent updates.
      BigVern ( December 10, 2015
   In its Jan. 15 blog post, Cryptsy says it now faces a 10,000
   bitcoin ($3.8 million) shortfall and identifies three available
   business options: It shutters the website and files for bankruptcy;
   someone purchases the exchange and makes good on the requested
   withdrawals; or the attacker returns the stolen bitcoins - no
   questions asked.
   While that might sound far-fetched, Cryptsy says that after the
   July 29, 2014, theft, based on the bitcoin wallet address tied
   to the theft, "those bitcoins have not moved once since this
   happened" which "gives rise to the possibility they can be
   recovered."
   To help, Cryptsy has offered a reward of 1,000 bitcoins ($380,000)
   for "information which leads to the recovery of the stolen coins."
Bye-Bye, Litecoins
   Cryptsy doesn't reference the fate of the missing litecoins. But
   they appear to have been cashed out: On July 2, 2014, someone
   dumped exactly 300,000 litecoins - quite a coincidence - onto
   an exchange all at once, which was such a large volume of coins
   that it temporarily drove down the price of each individual
   litecoin from $8.50 to just $2.
   As noted on a related Reddit conversation: "The volume was so
   high that he basically chewed through the entire buy side of the
   order book, all the way down to someone who had (probably on a
   lark) put in a buy order at $2," reports Reddit user FreeJack2k2.
   "After clearing out the ask side of the order book, the new sell
   orders only dropped to the low $7 range (the recovery from $2
   was immediate) and eventually got bought back to where we are
   now, at around $8. Whoever had that $2 buy order in the books
   made out like a bandit."

I'm not going to disagree with that at all, but here's the thing:
There has to be a root of trust in some way even if (or particularly
if) that root is math, pure math, and nothing but the math so help
me God.
That being said, I would suspect that any system which permits
absolutely zero recourse against things done with it that a super
majority of citizens considers abhorrent is a system that will not
be long tolerated and thus will not long exist.  What then is a
useful model of recourse?
The essential idea of checks and balances is that of prevention,
viz., that no one entity can permanently subvert the workings of
democratic society.  (Here I have to ask to please spare me the
anti-democratic invective.)  I have to agree with some poster or
other who said that Chaum's system only works if it is the only
system, otherwise the evil will just run down some other pipe than
his.  Fair enough, but if one is brilliant and paranoid, then a
system that invests absolutism in no single party is a design goal,
and a worthy design goal at that.  At the same time, if one's
paranoia, existential or otherwise, gets the better of you, then
you will want keep your hand on the tiller even while delegating
fragments of your authority all about.  So it is, I suspect, the
case here.  In other words, if you are too paranoid then you will
never be able to turn the whole thing over to its fate as embodied
in its design and its design alone -- you will wreck it all out of
the kind of paternalism that does seem to be irreducible core of
nearly every argument in the public sphere about safety.
Seriously, I am not arguing for cMix or Mr. Chaum.  I am saying,
carefully and calmly, that some understandable form of recourse is
an unavoidable condition for willing public acquiescence.  Chaum
made a proposal.  Comey made a proposal.  Proposals are likely to
now sprout like wildflowers.  Make one.

  I don't know, maybe I'm retarded, but this doesn't compute.
  What I'm afraid though, is that such abominations might catch on,
 because people like adopting flawed things, that give them illusion of

With respect, the stripping involved requires unanimity amongst the
nine sites, each much different than the other.  If one is to dismiss
Chaum's scheme due to the possibility of 9-way unanimous collusion,
then, in like manner, all threshold (split-key) cryptosystems are
unacceptable.  And then there is the DNS where the possibility of
collusion amongst all root servers would also trigger disavowal of
the DNS.
I'm probably missing your point.

@_subject: Re: FOIA adventures 
Federation of American Scientists current news brief, in part:
HOUSE POISED TO PASS FOIA AMENDMENTS
The House of Representatives is expected to approve a new package
of amendments to the Freedom of Information Act this week, in a
bill known as the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2015.
The sponsors of the bill said it "would strengthen the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) to increase transparency and accountability
in government, and improve access to government records for citizens.
It amends FOIA to provide for more disclosure of records, through
both proactive disclosure and limitations on the use of exemptions.
[It] also encourages enhanced agency compliance with statutory
requirements and improves the FOIA process for both agencies and
The bill would codify a presumption of openness, limit the application
of the exemption for deliberative records, facilitate electronic
submission of FOIA requests, strengthen the Office of Government
Information Services (the FOIA ombudsman), mandate Inspector General
reviews of FOIA processing, and several other steps. Detailed
justification for the bill is provided in a January 7 report from
the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
The bill was subsequently modified by the House Intelligence Committee
to affirm that its provisions would not require the disclosure of
properly classified information or of information that "would
adversely affect intelligence sources and methods" that are protected.
The term "adversely affect" is not defined but is clearly intended
to limit disclosure.
Truth be told, the Freedom of Information Act is a strange law that
seems engineered to create an unresolvable tension if not a complete
stalemate.  The FOIA empowers individual members of the public
(including me and you) to impose a legally binding obligation on a
government agency. But while there are no limits on the number or
type of requests that a requester may submit at no cost, agencies
are nominally supposed to accommodate the demand within a fixed
period and with fixed resources. And though it only takes minutes
to submit a request, the time required by an agency to fulfill even
a simple request is much longer. A sophisticated systems analysis
is not needed to anticipate the growth of the backlogs that have
in fact developed.
In a further conundrum, those agencies that are more responsive to
the FOIA process thereby tend to generate more demand. There is
little point in submitting a FOIA request to the Defense Intelligence
Agency, to pick one example, because they won't produce a substantive
response in this decade. But other agencies that do respond faithfully
are rewarded-- with more requests.
The best way to untangle and realign these conflicting imperatives
is not clear. More proactive disclosure of information might help,
or it might simply shift the burden to more specialized and challenging
requests. But just encouraging and making it easier to file FOIA
requests is probably not the solution.

Book review of Michael Hayden's new book, _Playing to the Edge_
When Gen. Michael V. Hayden arrived at Fort Meade as the director
of the National Security Agency in 1999, he made an alarming
discovery: America's premier signals intelligence agency did not
have email.  Two years later, just as he was finally managing to
modernize the agency's obsolescent technology, planes slammed into
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  In _Playing to the Edge,_
a memoir of his decade at the apex of America's spy agencies -- he
would head the CIA in 2006-09 -- Gen. Hayden offers a vivid account
of his experience of the 9/11 attack and much else.
The day began like any other.  But as the reports flowed in from
New York and Washington, routine gave way to the exigencies of war:
evacuating thousands of employees, hanging blackout curtains, moving
key teams to emergency stations.  Gen. Hayden recollects how, at
day's end, he returned home to his wife, embraced her and wept as
they absorbed what had happened to our country.
_Playing to the Edge_ offers a full excursion through the contemporary
challenges facing American intelligence, including cyber warfare,
Russian aggression, and armed conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq.
But it also presents an intimate personal portrait -- an account
of how its author came to be the man he is, someone who entered the
Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps while in college in the
late 1960s, who reveres his hometown of Pittsburgh (and its Steelers),
and who prays weekly in church for the souls of his twin sisters,
who died at birth when he was a boy of 10.
Naturally, given the years in which he held high office, much of
Gen. Hayden's book is devoted to the battle against terrorists.  He
makes it plain from the outset that though intelligence-gathering
is often in tension with liberty and the rule of law, its purpose
is to protect both.  The tension is most acute in the effort to
counter terrorism, for the mission is apprehending a class of people
with whom our judicial system is not designed to grapple: the
"not-yet guilty."
The NSA has sought to do such grappling in a number of ways, perhaps
most controversially with Stellarwind, a program designed to track
the U.S.-routed telephone calls of foreign terror suspects.  In
2005, the New York Times disclosed the program's existence, igniting
a political firestorm, with critics charging that Stellarwind
amounted to warrantless wiretapping and that it was nearly worthless
as an intelligence tool.
Unsurprisingly, Gen. Hayden rejects both contentions.  He walks
readers through the legal issues, acknowledging that the administration's
reasoning was, as in football, "playing to the edge".  But he
concludes, relying on the opinions of executive-branch lawyers and
FISA-court judges, that the operation was within the president's
constitutional authority as commander in chief.
As for the program's effectiveness, Gen. Hayden harbors no doubts:
Stellarwind, he writes, "uncovered illicit financing networks,
detected suspect travel, discovered ties to aviation schools, linked
transportation employees to associates of terrorists, drew connections
to the illicit purchases of arms, tied U.S. persons to Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed, and discovered a suspect terrorist on the no-fly list who
was already in the United States."
It was precisely the program's utility as a counterterrorism tool
that made its disclosure by the Times so damaging.  In general, the
numerous unauthorized news leaks of the post-9/11 era, Gen. Hayden
reports, led some key intelligence sources to clam up; others were
captured and executed.  He does not supply any specific details to
back up such claims, presumably because the CIA would not permit
him to do so.  While arguing for maximum possible openness, Gen.
Hayden observes that "espionage thrives in the shadows, and secrecy
is an essential component of its success."
Particularly galling to Gen. Hayden was a 2006 New York Times scoop
that compromised a top-secret program to track terrorist finances.
Three years later, the newspaper's editorial page was complaining
that American intelligence was failing to halt what it described
as "still a seemingly limitless stream of cash flowing to terrorist
groups".  Pointing to the hypocrisy on display -- the editorial was
titled "Follow the Money" -- Gen. Hayden wryly comments: "Thanks
for the suggestion."
The larger picture that Gen. Hayden draws makes vivid the extraordinary
range of challenges facing American intelligence and the high level
of uncertainty that the work entails.  A case study: Roughly a
decade ago, American intelligence observed that Syria was erecting
an elaborate structure in the desert near a town called al-Kibar.
CIA analysts puzzled over it but were unable to divine its purpose,
labeling it "enigmatic".  It was only when "a liaison partner" --
probably Israeli intelligence (although Gen. Hayden does not identify
it as such) -- provided detailed photographs that the CIA identified
a nuclear reactor of North Korean design.  Without local help, U.S.
intelligence would have missed a Syrian nuclear-bomb development
project.  Israel destroyed the site in a bombing raid in 2007.
The lesson that Gen. Hayden takes from the Syrian affair is sobering.
"We chalked this one up as intelligence success, after a fashion,"
he writes.  But he strongly intimates that it was really Israel's
success -- and America's failure.  More broadly, he says, Syrian
behavior "went beyond our understanding".  Extrapolating from this
mixed record, Gen Hayden is pessimistic that American intelligence
will fare well in tracking covert Iranian nuclear activity.  If his
pessimism is well-founded -- and there are few people more qualified
to judge -- the surprise we experienced on 9/11 may be a prelude
to a catastrophe of far greater dimensions.

Most everyone I know is participating in sensor networks beginning
with carrying smartphones.  Let us assume, for the moment, this is
with their eyes wide open as to the possible extent of such networks'
Here's another one,  which I mention as the
recording of license plates and everything else in the surround,
not just the driver's performance envelope, now comes to consumer
gear which, undoubtedly, insurance rates will soon reflect and,
in the fullness of time, subpoenas will seek.
There are a bejillion other technologies of like import coming and
coming soon.  Those (of us) who opt-out will face price discrimination
and, quite likely, participation discrimination on an accelerating
pace; look to Sweden's stance on cash money for an example (banks
no longer accept cash deposits, as I understand it).
The question here is perhaps obvious: Will you opt out and suffer
the consequences thereof?

DARPA will hold the world's first all-computer Capture the Flag
tournament in which automated systems may take the first steps
toward a defensible, connected future. DARPA's goal for the Cyber
Grand Challenge (CGC) is to spur an automation revolution in computer
security so machines can discover, confirm and fix software flaws
within seconds, instead of waiting up to a year as is typical under
the current human-centric system. DARPA believes these capabilities
are essential if the nation and world are to take full advantage
of the increasingly interlinked big-data revolution while protecting
data and processes-especially as more and more devices, including
vehicles and homes, get connected to the "Internet of Things".
Seven teams from across the United States have qualified to compete
in the Final Event. Nearly $4 million in prizes are at stake-along
with the chance to help revolutionize the future of cybersecurity.
The winning team will receive $2 million; second place will earn
$1 million; and third place will earn $750,000.
The CGC Final Event will take place August 4, 2016, live on stage
co-located with the DEF CON 24 conference in Las Vegas.
For more information, please visit: DARPA: Cyber Grand Challenge Final Event
WHAT: The World's First All Machine Hacking Tournament
WHEN: Thursday, August 4, 2016 (5:00pm - 8:00pm PCT)

  And I agree with you that they will probably try to coopt Bitcoin or at
 least blockchain technologies. If not to build their "cashless society"
 then at least to try to crowd out potential uses for anonymous transactions
 by ensuring that all the "legitimate" players are playing on a controlled &
 tracked blockchain.
I (think I) understand why a regime like China wants a
cashless society, but what is in it for Sweden (which is
much farther along the road to Hell)?

@_subject: Re: Do you notice significant persistent change in climate? 
As I read the literature, there is one whopping flywheel out there
(underwater) -- but it is unclear to me how that tiny sliver which
is land+air can be the driver.  Put differently, either it is
irrelevant or it is not; if irrelevant then we have to ask how it
is that the oceans are warming when the land+air which we are
modifying is so puny -or- if fully relevant then we have to ask how
much negative excursion the land+air has to take in order to wind
down that flywheel.  If it takes 300 years of burning coal to create
the warmed waters, then would one not have to scrub the atmosphere
clean of greenhouse gases for a couple of centuries to cool those
waters?  As I recall the models for "snowball earth," the presence
of ice down to the equator was a direct result of global algae
blooms that did, in fact, strip the atmosphere of greenhouse gases
and sequestered them in marine sediments leaving only volcanism as
the source of replenishment.
If taking the flywheel at face value, then one must conclude that
prevention is lost and only adaptation remains as an option.
Depopulating the coasts would thus be the most urgent target for
human-preservation planning, no?  Zurich would seem well positioned
to take over from London and NYC, for example.  The biggest public
display of scepticism to date w.r.t. global warming might have been
the $jillions of taxes spent to rebuild New Orleans' 9th Ward.  If
one remains convinced that action is possible and needful, the
question (for the anarchist persuasion, in particular) is what
government would you trust to administer compensatory global cooling?
Would you happily inject sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere(*)
for that purpose?  Should weather modification be subject to direct
democracy or does interventionist climate management require a
despotism?  Is this where sovereign unilateralism ends and world
government begins (wherein your personal needs and desires will be
vastly less relevant than they are even now)?
However satisfying, please to not pick one phrase in the above to
argue with; for cpunks relevance, the question is one of control
in a world of data-driven algorithmic regulation by non-human actors
acting in the name of the common good but uninterrogatable.
(*) "One kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would
roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand
kilograms of carbon dioxide."
