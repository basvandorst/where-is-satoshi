First, we'd like to explain what our paintings are, more importantly, what are paintings are not.  They are NOT prints, textured prints, or lithographs.  These are NOT canvas oil replicas copied from photographs with brushstrokes thrown in at random.  They are NOT some unknown artist rendition of a masters' work on canvas or paper.
These are, in fact, oils on canvas done by machine.  Yes, by machine.  Only a machine would replicate the original artists' work with total accuracy.  Machines, unlike artists, have no ego to feed.  Patterns, called transparencies, are created using the original as their model.  This method not only allows for exact matching of the colors but exact matching of the masters' brushstrokes.
These are in fact, replicas that are as magnificent as their original namesakes. Nothing is left to chance making these fine works of art virtually indistinguishable from the original.
