I would put it more strongly than that. I think that NIST needs to be punis=

I imagine that everyone is looking at public protocols for picking curves n=

OK. I was flat out wrong. I was ignorant of your longstanding view of ciphe=

Ah. So yes, we are in very different starting places. Your choice seems ver=

pay attention and follow the consensus advice.  You may be competent to, sa=

don=92t want to have to make those choices.
Not only is it that I don=92t want to make such choices, but you shouldn=92=

So, I guess that some of my frustration that I=92m taking out in various di=

Yep. I was certainly aware of the risks, but I guess I took a bit of a CYA =

Yes. I fully agree. And I agree that there were things that went into the s=

But having been selected more than a decade ago, AES has been subject to fa=

Acknowledged. I had misjudged your motivations, and in a fairly insulting w=

t the NIST standards are flawed, either intentionally or unintentionally; i=
n short, was BULLRUN *successful*. If you think they're flawed, it's easy; =
you move away from them.
My take is that BULLRUN was successful in parts. I=92m not sure whether the=
 count Dual_EC_DRBG as a success or not, as problems with it were discovere=
d early. It stank from the outset and BULLRUN just confirmed that the stink=
 had a nasty source. Leaving RSA Inc aside, no one really needed to change =
ciphersuites. Yet it was that revelation that sent me reeling. So the quest=
ion which other standards *could* they have gotten away with subverting. Qu=
ite simply not everything has the kind of math that Dual_EC_DRBG has and no=
t everything has the same =93gaps=94 in the history of where certain things=
 come from.
You seem to be suggesting that if BULLRUN was successful anywhere, then it =
was successful everywhere (and they tried it with everything). Furthermore,=
 at least with AES, you seem to be assuming that if BULLRUN was successful =
in a case in 2006, then it was also done successfully before 2001.
And so when looking at which things I need to move away from, I have to jud=
ge the risks that they=92ve been compromised in light of all of the informa=
tion that we have. The new information was confirmation that at least after=
 2001, the NSA was willing and able to subvert at least one NIST cryptograp=
hic standard. I have to integrate that piece of exceedingly distressing new=
s in light of everything else we know about the things I rely on.
And so this is what we rely on: AES, SHA-2, and the (alleged) CSPRNGs in co=
mmercial operating systems.
Looking at those realistically, my energies haven=92t been focused on looki=

=92t about AES and SHA-2, I=92m actually pissed off at this action. It puts=

security theater.
t as well get off AES and SHA-2 as well.
Fair point. As we aren=92t doing any public key stuff, we don=92t need to h=

But (and given that my previous message got MIME-mangled, I=92ll repeat som=

replacement, which reek of security theater.
I=92ll grant that a priori any SHA-3 finalist will be an improvement on SHA=

Right. We don=92t know whether Apple escrows the key in the absence of
people asking them to, but we do know that they do offer to store a

So an instance of Apple being able to help someone recover their FileVault2
data proves absolutely nothing.
I have spoken to people who specialize in forensics recovery for Apple
products and who have close relations to Apple. Those conversations lead
me to believe that there is no backdoor that they are aware of. Of course,
if there were, they would not reveal that information to me.
I do think, however, that if there are such backdoors, it would have
to be known to only a very small number of people. Too many of the people
who work on Apple security would blow the whistle. So it would have to
be introduced in such a way that most of the people who actually develop
these tools are unaware of the backdoors. It=92s certainly possible, but
it does shift balance of plausibility.
