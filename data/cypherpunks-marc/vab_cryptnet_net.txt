@_subject: ANNC:  PGP Key-signing party @ ITSA Day in Gnv. Fl, USA 
Hash: SHA1
In the interest of helping organizations attending the ITSA Security Day
conference establish a best practices model of computer security policy,
e-TechServices.com will be sponsoring a PGP Key-signing party.
The PGP key-signing party held during the ITSA Security Day on Wednesday,
September 26th, 2001 from 12:15pm - 12:45pm at the e-TechServices.com
table at the Retiz Union in Gainesville, Florida.

What's a key-signing party?
A key-signing party is a get-together with PGP users for the purpose of
meeting other PGP users and signing each other's keys. This helps to
extend the "web of trust" to a great degree. Also, it sometimes serves as
a forum to discuss strong cryptography, computer security, and related
Required Items?
1. Physical attendance
2. Positive picture ID
3. A printout of your PGP key's fingerprint information
4. A pen/pencil or whatever you'd like to write with
Why should I use PGP?
You should use PGP, in order to protect your business and personal emails
from being read by individuals or entities other than your intended
recipient(s). You should also use PGP in order to protect against the
forgery or alteration of official communications from your organization.
PGP, when used correctly, can provide message privacy, message integrity,
message authentication, and to some degree non-repudibility.
OK. What are some good applications of PGP?
Protection of email traffic of a sensitive nature, such as the
coordination of response to ongoing security incidents, requests for DNS
modifications, the exchange of passwords, requests for networking changes,
and exchange of sensitive personal information like SSNs. At the very
least, it would be useful to have all such messages signed, so the
recipients could be sure that the notes were not forged. PGP can also be
used to provide the same protection in the area of computer software
distribution. For example PGP can be used in software distribution where
security is critical, such as in the distribution of computer security
patches or other security related software updates.
Why should I participate in the ITSA Day keysigning party?
The formation of a robust web of trust with a deep level of
interconnectivity is the foundation for the security and utility of PGP.
Participating in the key signing event will allow you to become integrated
into the web of trust and thereby place your organization and yourself in
a position to enjoy the benefits of the PGP technology. Participation will
also help to promote the use of PGP and reinforce people currently using
PGP resulting in a more safe and secure computing environment for us all.
The more people who use PGP, the stronger PGP becomes.

Gainesville is available at:
Please, forward this note to anyone who may be interested in attending.
Also, please fee free to contact me for personal assistance with key
generation or additional information on participating.

At the cypherpunks meeting in SF during CodeCon, I think it was
Dave Del Torto who asked for a show of hands of punks looking
for work.  It was better than half.
With the economy starting to improve and rumors of a trickle of VC money, now might not be a bad time to try and launch a start
up. I know Sandy was trying to get something started down south.
I've been spending allot of time on cypherpunk type projects,
but with a day job progress has been slow and hard.  I'd be interested in joining a company to work on something that could translate into technical progress for the cypherpunk movement.
I think there's good opportunity in digital signature applications, PKI alternatives, and reputation systems.
Unfortunately, I don't see opportunity with electronic
currency - at least not in the US.

It's best not to contact the PTO or the patent holder with prior art.  Gregory Aharonian has written some interesting material on
this in his Patent News newsletter.
If you contact the patent holder or the PTO with the prior art,
it will likely be listed in the patent, or future patents if the
application has already been granted.  In the case of an existing
patents, presenting prior art to the PTO can result it the prior art being given a "previously reviewed" status.  Prior art
with a "previously reviewed" status, or prior art listed on the
patent are both much less effective in a defense case against an infringement claim.  Therefor alerting the patent holder or the
PTO to prior art would actually make the patent stronger and less
likely to be invalidated.
Basically, the patent system is so corrupt, the best thing to
do is to avoid participating it in.  Just like the US democratic

Given your requirements, you may want to run VMWare on a
Linux host computer.  The windows partition you'd like
to encrypt would then appear as a file in a Linux
partition which could be operated on by the tools and
technologies available for Linux.

Archive it your selfs you fucking wankers.  Damn.  Since when
can cypherpunks not even handle setting up a public mailing
list archive?  If that's beyond you, you probably don't
belong on the cypherpunks list.
What do you need a government assistance program?  Some public
service announcements?  A welfare sponsored skills training
