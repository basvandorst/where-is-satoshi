This is becomeing more and more of an issue for me.  I'm using MailScanner
4.30.3 and SpamAssassin 2.63.  I've whitelisted anything from
"dickinson.edu" so as to prevent any campus mailings from being labeled as
spam.  Now I've run into forged headers that list "xxx as
the sender and they're being whitelisted.  The attached message was
interesting in that the only place "dickinson.edu" is listed is in the
"X-MailScanner-From" line (and they chose my own address to boot).  I'm
open to suggestions here.  It hasn't happened too often but you know it'll
pick up as time goes on.  Thanks.
