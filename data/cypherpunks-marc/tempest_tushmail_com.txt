Juan Garofalo:
if you trust a vpn, what does that say about you? outting vpns for being
put into the situation of either complying with the law or facing
criminal sanctions themselves is counter productive. if one is truly
concerned about their anonymity, they shouldn't use a vpn. this is just
another example of why.
