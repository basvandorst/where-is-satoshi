@_subject: Anonymizer employees need killing 
Anonymizer is working with the FBI on international blackmail cases - no subpoena required!
"To download the online picture, he used the Anonymizer.com service, believing the companys privacy policy would protect him. Not so. Dutch police worked closely with the US company and the FBI to track him down. He was caught red-handed last year when he withdrew the money from a cash machine using his copy of the credit card. Which just goes to show that even criminal masterminds can make simple mistakes. The error, experts say, could have been easily avoided if the blackmailer had visited an internet cafe to download the encoded picture, rather than using his own PC. What's more, he paid for the Anonymizer service through Paypal, giving his personal email address."
Fuck these sell-outs.
