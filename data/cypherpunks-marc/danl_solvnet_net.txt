Hey Hey!
This is our favorite spammer without any security. We daily get the MSpatch and subsequent rocketmail error emails from our friend in france. If anyone still has the original see if he is also our jabbar bash guy. I have my doubts but maybe the french authorities might be Received: from  ([203.89.239.234])

This looks likke the french spammer with an infected computer. We daily get the microsoft patch and admin error from this place.
