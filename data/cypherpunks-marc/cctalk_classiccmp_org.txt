My early Christmas present was finding all of the wonderful and amazing
people already gathered here and on other fora concerning classic
computing, especially S-100 systems that I missed the development of while
at a service academy, stationed overseas, and forward-deployed aboard ships.
Donations of, and discounts on, systems, boards, components, parts,
software, etc., for my 7th - 12th grade Computing and Science classroom in
very rural Montana have been additional much-appreciated gifts.  Stockings
stuffed with help from the friendly folks here has been the icing on the
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night, in the broadest sense
Office and was  the spirit of all of the Winter holidays.

Merry Christmas, all.
May there be classic computing under your tree and in your life every day.
My exercise this month is to refurbish a Mac Quadra 800 and install A/UX 3.1
