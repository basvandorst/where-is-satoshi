I wonder whether the authors know that it is impossible to stop anonymous
communications for the intelligent criminal or terrorist who is willing to
jump through a few hoops.
If they don't, they shouldn't be writing such reports, as they are not
qualified. If they do, then I wonder at their motives. The use of the term
"wide-scale" is worrying in it's implication that they do know of the
impossibility, and merely want to prevent anonymity for the masses.
If the motive is to provide general surveillance capability, it is
reprehensible and oppressive. Didn't you 'merkins once fight against
oppressive government?
If it's intended to help catch the dumb criminals and terrorists, they are
mistaken about it's likely effectiveness - tracing is only useful when there
is something worth tracing, and this only happens when people are unaware
that their communications can be traced.
Even dumb criminals and terrorists (who can usually be caught by less
intrusive methods anyway) will quickly learn not to use traceable
communications. Disposable mobile- and pay- phones are already favourites. I
suppose they might be comparing the slight, short-term benefit to be gained
in the ease of catching the dumb against the long-term loss of liberty for
all, and weighing the loss of liberty at naught.
If the motive is to give citizens the feeling that something is being done,
it's just more political bullshit, but with unfortunate consequences. I
can't think of any other possible motives.

@_subject: Re: Psuedo-Private Key (eJazeera) 
Yes it exists. It's called deniable encryption. Two-level deniable
encryption is not hard, but it usually involves increases in data size.
There is some stuff about this in Crypto and Eurocrypt reports.
Steganography and steganogaphic filing systems can do something similar, but
the increase in message size tends to be larger.
I am developing a form of deniable encryption (as part of m-o-o-t) that
works slightly differently and does not involve message-size increases - in
fact it it decreases message size.
It's grammer-based and works a bit like this: A sentence is parsed, and eg
a noun is encoded as a number relating to one of a publicly shared
dictionary of nouns. This number is then encrypted. Decrypting with a random
key will give a noun in that position in the sentence in all possible
decryptions, and a good proportion of all randomly keyed decryptions will
apparently make sense.
There is a lot more involved, so eg both parties can give out the same false
key, and so eg the same nouns used more than once in a message will decrypt
to identical nouns in decryptions, as well as notions of closeness in the
words used in a typical message, but I have done both the theoretical
unicity calculations and some practical tests, and it works for email-length
messages. The main implementation problems I have are coding time and that the only
parser that works well enough is proprietary. If anyone else is working on
something similar I would like to know. I'm probably not a cypherpunk, more
a privacy avocate, but I do write code.

It's a nice idea, but it needs a tensile-strength-to-mass ratio equivalent
to holding a girl and her mother up by a single thread of her 10 denier

at the moment we can't build it. You also need 45,000 km or so of tether.
Expensive. Huge investment, fragile. Unrealistic, imo.
Rotating tethers on the other hand can use hi-test fishing line. Really, no
kidding.  You only need a few hundred km, or at most a few thousand km, of
tether. Cheap.
There are two types, landing takeup and hypersonic takeup. They work a bit
like this (here goes a try at some ascii art...)
               [] orbiting mass-->
                \
                 \ rotating tether

           ________________________
                           earth
(on this scale a space elevator cable would be roughly six feet long)
The tether, whose centre of gravity is in a fairly low orbit, dips it's end
into the earth's atmosphere every so often. Hypersonic takeup tethers catch
a 'plane flying at hypersonic speeds in the upper atmosphere, and landing
takeup tethers reach the surface. The energy/momentum is replaced by sending
current through the tether as it passes through the Earth's magnetic field.
Hypersonic takeup tethers are better studied, even the rendezvous techniques
apparently work, and can use fishing line except for the short length that
enters the upper atmosphere (it would melt). They use a mesh-like tether
structure to avoid catastrophic damage from meteorites etc (a patented, but
IMO obvious, idea).
Landing tethers sort of cast the line a bit ahead, like a fisherman; it hits
the ground, is tied on to the spaceship (good knots!) and then the line and
the spaceship are dragged up. No-one really has studied them much (except
me, and I'm not telling yet), but the strength (and length) of line needed
is _much_ (order of mag+) less than a space elevator. And you don't need a
hypersonic 'plane.
You can also fling things away from the tether when they're going away from
the Earth. Can get any (reasonable) speed you like.

a decaying sine at a frequency (z-at)?
There's more, and it's to do with the limits of fourier and sampling theory.
Say you have a wave at a frequency of z that's sampled according to nyquist
theory. can you distinguish it from a wave of a frequency z - delta z? It
can be done, but it takes a while, and a good few samples to do it. And a
good analogue system will do it quicker.

Eh? It's a spiral.
The constant linear velocity applies to the scan velocity (1.3 m/s at 1x),
not the head velocity, which might cause problems.
Also the spiral track/ holes in the centre aren't accurate enough to follow
the track without real-time correction, done by some complex optical tricks
and feedback loops.
However, it should be quite easy to get a signal from somewhere in the CD
player (especially from early ones which split the functions between lots of
chips), probably best would be from the EFM (eight to fourteen modulation)
or frame output. This will include all the interesting subcodes etc., plus
sync and C1/C2 parity bytes.
That's a fairly clean (it's digital, but with errors) signal at about 2.1
Mb/s at 1x speed, so it shouldn't be hard to capture and analyse in real
time  :). However, you will still have to do the CIRC decoding.
If you are feeling adventurous you could just take a signal from the laser
head, and do the timing, EFM, circ etc yourself. That will give you the
pits, plus the errors, plus a lot (!) of work. Not recommended really,
unlees you need it for some (anti?) copy-protection purpose.
As for getting the player to actually follow the track on a protected disc,
again the solution is probably to go for an older player and hack about. I
used to repair them (a long time ago, when it was worth doing), it should be
quite easy (though I'm no expert on CD copy protection). There was a mod
involving just putting a few volts on one chip lead on an early Sony model,
but I can't remember enough details to find a ref.
A curiosity, only tenuously related - I just came across a Feb 1994 copy of
Elector magazine, with plans for a S/PDIF copybit eliminator (for SCMS).

Information-theoretic deniability is impossible (or impractical). You can
have computationally-bounded secure deniability though.
StegFS (if that's the one Markus Kuhn wrote, there is another program with a
similar name which isn't as secure), and the other construction in Ross
Anderson, Roger Needham and Adi Shamir's paper [1] are pretty good, at least
as good as your outline construction.
All hide ciphertext in random data, rather than in eg images, where there is
no underlying pattern to the covertext which an adversary can use a better
understanding of than the filing system has to extract and identify
The moral? - hide ciphertext in random data, not "partly-random" data such
as images.
You might also want to look at Mnemosyne [2], but I haven't analysed it and
have no idea whether it's any good.
It also depends on whether your adversary is going to torture you, or take
you to Court. There's not a great deal of difference in effect, but a
torturer can harm you on suspicion only, whereby a Court can't jail you on
suspicion alone but needs, at least in theory, proof beyond reasonable
Getting a bit theoretical now, but still important:
Two problems with all these systems are observability and secure deletion.
If the database can be continuously observed (eg a NFS-based FS) then an
adversary can ask why the SFS was modified. This can be overcome - I'm
writing a paper on how to do that right now, but it's not finished yet.
Secure deletion is harder - if someone can prove that some data is in the
SFS (or, combining this with observability, that some data was at some time
in the SFS) then they can demand a key - are you going to remember a zillion
different keys/passwords, and what they refer to? If you store them
somewhere then they can demand the key to the keys, so to speak.
I think secure deletion in observable SFS's is impossible, it seems obvious
on information grounds - but there also seems to be just a teeny hint of a
crack in that proof. I'm working on it.
James, you might want to move this to eg the cryptography list if you want
more technical answers. Or subject yourself to sci.crypt's abuse, which will
at least stop some elementary mistakes.

No need. The best known discreet logarithm attacks are such that if they succeed in
the attack then they can easily apply their solution to anything encrypted
with the same prime. A shared prime attracts attacks. Widely used primes can
become a big target.
These attacks are generally supposed to be beyond capability for the next X
zillion years though. Or perhaps for ten years.
This might seem garubonsendese in the naive ""it's safe' or 'it's not safe""
crypto paradigm. However, that isn't how crypto works.
Cryptanalysis (the revealing of plaintext against the wishes of the
encryptor) is an economic activity. No-one will bother putting in enough
resources to break your 2k-bit modexp-based crypto unless they think it
But if your prime is shared with several other people who are sending
nuclear secrets, then your prime might become subject to attack.
The prime is public - anyone can know it  - so it's retrieval won't affect
anything. The question I think you are asking is "if the secret key is retrieved, will
I lose forward security", to which the answer is "yes".
For long-term forward secrecy you need to change the public key every every
day or so. Use a long-term key to sign the daily keys. PGP does this.
Once you have deleted the day's public key, you are OK (but see belaw!).
The ephemeral keys cannot (or should not) be retrive(able)d.
(below!) Or perhaps the question you were asking was "if finding DL's mod
_this prime_ becomes possible, will I lose forward security?", in which case
the answer is "yer fukked" - as are we all - if one prime gets broken, they
all will, sooner or later.

This is the law that enables Policemen to demand keys to encrypted material, on pain of imprisonment, and without judicial approval of these demands.
There is one last Parliamentary process to go through, the approval of a code of practice, but as far as I know there has never been a case of one of these failing to pass - though a related one was withdrawn a few years ago. We will try to prevent it happening, the chances of success are against us but it is not impossible.
You are not required to keep keys indefinitely, or give up a key you don't have, but the rules regarding the assumption that you know a key at least partially reverse the normal burden of proof.

BULLRUN seems to be just an overarching name for several wide programs to obtain plaintext of passively encrypted internet communications by many different methods.
While there seem to be many non-cryptographic attacks included in the BULLRUN program, of particular interest is the cryptographic attack mentioned in the Snowden papers and also hinted at in earlier US congressional manouverings for NSA funding.
The most obvious target of attack is some widespread implementation of SSL/TLS, and while it might just be an attack against a reduced keyspace, eg password-guessing or RNG compromise, I wonder whether NSA have actually made a big cryptographic break against some cipher, and if so, against what?
Candidate ciphers are:
and key establishment mechanisms:
I don't think a break in another cipher or KEM would be widespread enough to matter much. Assuming NSA (or possibly GCHQ) have made a big I don't think it's against 3DES or RC4, though the latter is used a lot more than people imagine.
AES? Maybe, but a break in AES would be a very big deal. I don't know whether hiding that would be politically acceptable.
RSA? Well, maybe indeed. Break even a few dozen RSA keys per month, and you get a goodly proportion of all internet encrypted traffic. It's just another advance on factorisation.
If you can break RSA you can probably break DH as well.
ECDH? Again quite possible, especially against the curves in use - but perhaps a more widespread break against ECDH is possible as well. The math says that it can be done starting with a given curve (though we don't know how to do it), and you only need to do the hard part once per My money? RSA.
But even so, double encrypting with two different ciphers (and using two different KEMs) seems a lot more respectable now.

Given that mostly security works (or it should), what's really important is where that security fails - and "good enough" security can drive out excellent security.
We can easily have excellent security in TLS (mk 2?) - the crypto part of TLS can be unbreakable, code to follow (hah!) - but 1024-bit DHE isn't say unbreakable for 10 years, far less for a lifetime.
We are only talking about security against an NSA-level opponent here. Is that significant?
Eg, Tor isn't robust against NSA-level opponents. Is OTR?
No, and you don't know how important your opponent thinks the information is either, and therefore what resources he might be willing or able to spend to get access to it - but we can make some crypto which (we think) is unbreakable.
No matter who or what resources, unbreakable. You can rely on the math.
And it doesn't usually cost any more than we are willing to pay - heck, the price is usually lost in the noise.
Zero crypto (theory) failures.
Ok, real-world systems won't ever meet that standard - but please don't hobble them with failure before they start trying.
Do you mean I-i's?
Ah, average, Which average might that be? Hmmm, independent distributions of two variables - are you going to average them, then multiply the averages?
That approximation doesn't actually work very well, mathematically speaking - as I'm sure you know.
I totally agree with zero configuration - and best fit - but you are missing the main point.
Would 1024-bit DHE give a reasonable expectation of say, ten years unbreakable by NSA?
If not, and Manning or Snowden wanted to use TLS, they would likely be Incidentally, would OTR pass that test?

No. No. No. Please, no? No. Nonononononono.
It's Summa (over i)  P_i.I_i where P_i is the protection provided to information i, and I_i is the importance of keeping information i Actually it's more complex than that, as the importance isn't a linear variable, and information isn't either - but there's a start.
Increasing i by increasing users may have little effect on the overall security, if the protecting the information they transmit isn't particularly valuable.
And saying that something is secure - which is what people who are not cryptographers think you are doing when you recommend that something - tends to increase I_i, the importance of the information to be protected.
And if the new system isn't secure against expensive attacks, then overall security may be lessened by it's introduction. Even if Users are I have about 30 internet passwords, only three of which are in any way important to me - those are the banking ones. I use a simple password for all the rest, because I don't much care if they are compromised.
But I use the same TLS for all these sites.
Now if that TLS is broken as far as likely attacks against the banks go, I care. I don't much care if it's secure against attacks against the other sites like my electricity and gas bills.
I might use TLS a lot more for non-banking sites, but I don't really require it to be secure for those. I do require it to be secure for banking.
And I'm sure that some people would like TLS to be secure against the NSA for, oh, let's say 10 years. Which 1024-bit DHE will not provide.
If you really want to recommend 1024-bit DHE, then call a spade a spade - for a start, it's EKS, ephemeral key setup. It doesn't offer much in the way of forward secrecy, and it offers nothing at all in the way of perfect forward secrecy.
It's a political stunt to perhaps make trawling attacks by NSA more expensive (in cases where the website has given NSA the master keys [*]) - but it may make targeted attacks by NSA cheaper and easier.
And in ten years NSA *will* be able to read all your 1024-bit DHE traffic, which it is storing right now against the day.
[*] does anyone else think it odd that the benefit of introducing 1024-bit DHE, as opposed to 2048-bit RSA, is only active when the webserver has given or will give NSA the keys? Just why is this being considered for recommendation?
Yes, stunt.

To hell with perfect. I won't even use the word when describing forward secrecy (unless it's an OTP).
If you just want a down-and-dirty 2048-bit FS solution which will work today, why not just have the websites sign a new RSA-2048 sub-certificate every day? Or every few hours? And delete the secret key, of course.
Forward secrecy doesn't have to be per-session.
Though frankly, I don't think ubiquitous 1024-bit FS without deployment of some software/RFC/standard is possible, and if so that deployment should also include a 2048-bit solution as well. And maybe 3072-bit and 4096-bit solutions too.
And please please please don't call them all the same thing - because they aren't.
But, the immediate question before the court of TLS now is - "do we recommend a 1024-bit FS solution?"

Yes, some - but I don't believe that's enough. Historically, it would not have been (and wasn't) - it doesn't take account of algorithm I actually based the 1,536-bit figure on the old RSA factoring challenges, and how long it took to break them.
We are publicly at 768 bits now, and that's very expensive  - and, over the last twenty years the rate of public advance has been about 256 bits per decade.
So at that rate 1,536 bits would become possible but very expensive in 2043, and would still be impossible in 2030.
If 1,024 is possible but very expensive for NSA now, and 256 bits per decade is right, then 1,536 may just be on the verge of edging into possibility in 2030 - but I think progress is going to slow (unless they develop quantum computers).
We have already found many of the "easy-to-find" advances in theory.

Recommendations are given herein as: symmetric_key_length -> recommended_equivalent_RSA_key_length, in bits.
Looking at Wikipedia,  I see:
"As of 2003 RSA Security claims that 1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit RSA keys to 112-bit symmetric keys and 3072-bit RSA keys to 128-bit symmetric keys. RSA claims that 1024-bit keys are likely to become crackable some time between 2006 and 2010 and that 2048-bit keys are sufficient until 2030. An RSA key length of 3072 bits should be used if security is required beyond 2030.[6]"
That page doesn't give any actual recommendations or long-term dates from RSA now. It gives the "traditional recommendations" 80 -> 1024 and 112 -> 2048, and a 2000 Lenstra/Verheul minimum commercial recommendation for 2010 of 78 -> 1369.
"NIST key management guidelines further suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 256-bit symmetric keys.[7]"
NIST also give the "traditional" recommendations, 80 -> 1024 and 112 -> 2048, plus 128 -> 3072, 192 -> 7680, 256 -> 15360.
I get that 1024 bits is about on the edge, about equivalent to 80 bits or a little less, and may be crackable either now or sometime soon.
But, I wonder, where do these longer equivalent figures come from?
I don't know, I'm just asking - and I chose Wikipedia because that's the general "wisdom".
Is this an area where NSA have "shaped the worldwide cryptography marketplace to make it more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed by NSA/CSS", by perhaps greatly exaggerating the equivalent lengths?
And by emphasising the difficulty of using longer keys?
As I said, I do not know. I merely raise the possibility.
[ Personally, I recommend 1,536 bit RSA keys and DH primes for security to 2030, 2,048 if 1,536 is unavailable, 4,096 bits if paranoid/high value; and not using RSA at all for longer term security. I don't know whether someone will build that sort of quantum computer one day, but they might. ]

There is a another, different hypothesis - that the lump of data is the same lump of data, possibly re-encrypted, as another lump of data somewhere else.
Perhaps we need a new definition of (pseudo-) random for that situation.
On a personal note, I have been struggling with this idea, in terms of cover traffic, for the last 9 or 10 years - but I haven't gotten anywhere much beyond the obvious, nothing noticeably brilliant :(
IMO. the whole subject of cover traffic needs to be investigated much further, and with rigor.
Take, as an example, a steganographic filing system where the files are kept in a public cloud, and it is easy for an observer to see when encrypted files are stored and recovered.
For simplicity, assume all files are the same size (padding, concatenation of associated files, etc).
In the cloud there will be real files which contain real data, and cover files which do not. The files, real or cover, may be re-encrypted from time to time, and perhaps returned to the cloud under different To an observer the operation of re-encryption should be the indistinguishable from the operations of writing, modifying, or deleting [1] a file.
In one instance of this there are multiple copies of real files and cover traffic files, so that an observer who can see traffic cannot imediately identify which files are real and which are not. The user may also keep a local pool of files to make real-world timimg information less useful.
The problem now is the pattern of file accesses. If the user loads ten files every time he starts a session, it is much harder to hide the real files than if he does not.
Ideally, file accesses should look random - but this is not practicable, and if we don't want the user to have to wait days to open a file, it is perhaps not even possible.
Now comes the only smart part I have found:
Somewhat easier ( or perhaps a _lot_ harder ) than generating lots and lots of random traffic, the covertraffic generator might generate lesser amountys of *suspicious but bogus* patterns of file accesses.
That can perhaps lessen bandwidth, but it ain't easy.

Yes, that is a big problem with SSL and TLS.
The desire for backwards compatibility and cipher agility means that the little padlock in the browser doesn't actually mean very much - the suite in use might be so weak as to be no better than unauthenticated More, the average user doesn't usually have a clue what's going on - How secure is the suite in use? Does the suite in use have forward security? Is there any authentication? Is the authentication reliable?  Is there any encryption? Is it actually secure in any way?  - these are questions the average user cannot answer.
Heck, I can't answer them most of the time without digging into the innards of the session.
Backwards compatibility and cipher agility also permit cipher suite choice degradation attacks like FREAK and logjam, where weak suites are forced on the user.
To be secure, cipher agility absolutely requires that weak or broken ciphers can be effectively and definitively eliminated from use - but there is no real mechanism in SSL/TLS for doing that.
One solution is - in TLS3 abolish cipher agility, and have only one suite: call it Jim's suite.
The little padlock in the browser now says "protected by Jim". Everybody now knows what that means, or can find out. The meaning doesn't change according to things going on in the computer which the ordinary guy has no clue about.
After a few years, when Jim's suite is getting a little iffy, introduce Tom's suite in TLS4. Depreciate Jim's suite, then remove it.
People shouldn't really be rewriting libreSSL - they should be writing libreTLS3 instead, with no cipher suite agility.
Apart from anything else, with only one suite and one protocol, that should be a lot easier to do.
ps is there an archive of libreSSL anywhere?
