Coincidentally, this was discussed about a week ago - the
problem arises because Apache::ASP returns an explicit
status of "200". Try the following - in
   D:\Path\to\your\Perl\site\lib\Apache\ASP.pm
insert near the top
   use Apache::Const -compile => ':common';
Then, around line 255, there is a subroutine called handler,
with a line in it that says
  my $status = 200;
Change this to
  my $status = Apache::OK;
There may be other places that return explicit numerical
codes that also may need changing, but this should fix
the above problem for pages that return OK.
