Victoria Police Crime Stoppers
Crime Stoppers offers members of the general public an opportunity to
make confidential calls to the police about any criminal activity.
Calls are not recorded. All callers are given a code number for
identification which they require when making further contact with
Crime Stoppers. If the information leads to an arrest, the caller may
be eligible for a reward of up to $1,000. Crime Stoppers offers a way
of overcoming many of the reasons which inhibit people from reporting
crime, such as not wanting to get involved, fear of retribution and not
being sure that what they have to report is of any significance or who
to tell. Hours of Operation The Crime Stoppers call centre is staffed by Victoria Police personnel
between 7am and 11pm, seven days a week. Information can be left on a
voice mail system outside these hours. Free Call Telephone Number - 1 800 333 000 Crime Stoppers operates nationally and can be called on a free call
hotline from anywhere in Australia. If you are calling from Victoria
your call will be directed to the Victoria Police Crime Stoppers call
centre. Anonymity For those callers who wish to remain anonymous, their total anonymity
is guaranteed. If callers choose to remain anonymous, they are given a
code number which they use when contacting Crime Stoppers to provide
further information and/or to collect a reward. The callers anonymity applies even to the board members and other
police outside of the Crime Stoppers Unit who may be involved in the
investigation. Do Crime Stoppers record or use caller display phones? At Crime Stoppers, the emphasis is on protecting the identity of all
callers. Crime Stoppers does not record calls or use caller display
phones otherwise the whole Crime Stoppers program - not only in
Australia but worldwide, would lose its credibility and valuable
criminal information.
Cash Rewards Crime Stoppers pays cash rewards for information that results in the
arrest of an offender. Will I receive a reward for any information? Crime Stoppers pay rewards for any piece of information that leads to
an arrest. The information can be about any crime, not just crimes
featured in the media. Do I get a reward if I call a police station with information? Members of the public will always phone police stations with
information and this is always encouraged. These callers do not qualify
for a Crime Stoppers reward because the Crime Stoppers Unit did not
receive and process the call. How is the amount of the reward determined? The rewards are paid for and administered by the board of Crime
Stoppers Victoria Ltd. Police recommend to the board of management that
a reward be considered for payment to a caller. The amount of the
reward is determined by a points rating scale including the seriousness
of the crime, the number of persons arrested, the number of charges
laid, the value of property recovered or the value of drugs seized. How can I receive a reward and still remain anonymous? The caller is advised to call back after a scheduled board meeting at
which the reward amount will be considered. Suitable arrangements will
then be made for payment of the reward. At all times the identity of
the caller is safeguarded. The normal practice is for the caller to
identify themself with their code number. Crime Stoppers can then make
a cash deposit of the reward amount into a nominated bank account or
alternatively, arrange cash payment at a nominated location.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A U.S. Navy submarine and an amphibious  transport ship collided off the coast of Oman as they were getting ready to  transfer two sailors, but no one was injured. The sub was the same one that  collided with a Japanese fishing boat off the Hawaiian coast last year.
 The incident Sunday punctured the fuel tank of the amphibious transport dock  ship USS Ogden and caused some damage to the submarine USS Greeneville,  Pentagon officials said Monday.
 The Greeneville had collided with a Japanese fishing vessel off the Hawaiian coast  on Feb. 9, 2001, leaving nine Japanese dead. And on its first major deployment  after that incident, the sub grounded while trying to enter the Saipan seaport last  August in rough seas.
Maybe Osama was aboard?

Or maybe since Mafiaboy confessed to being a Robo-head, they're
watching dextromethorphine, the cough-suppressing but not terribly
euphoric isomer used in cold meds and by bored teenagers.
Its the pseudoephedrine which is the major input to most amphetamine
and methamphetamine syntheses.  The feds (who cause the illicit
labs via their prohibition) find cases of PE bottles with their
bottoms sliced off.
The synthesis makes a small change to the PE molecule producing
a diferent molecule.  There is no speed in PE; a long time ago
centrally active amphetamines were used in inhalers, but no more (it was readily extracted and purified.)
Steve Shear: nasal sprays are good for hydrating the membranes
that coldbugs target; heated winter air dries them.  Zinc may help.  But someone buying Nyquil-type drugs is already infected
and just wants a break from symptoms.
Neil: You'd be better off reading the labels on brand-name
Nyquil and buying the ingredients separately and generically.
That way you can avoid taking something you don't need --say
pseudoephedrine which dries membranes-- when all you want
is dextro's cough suppressant effect.  The other ingredient
tends to be anti-histamines (and ethanol) which help you sleep
if nothing else.  Enough biology for now.

By Robert O'Harrow Jr.Washington Post Staff
WriterFriday, February 1, 2002; Page A01 Federal aviation authorities and technology companies will soon begin
testing a vast air security screening system designed to instantly
pull together every passenger's travel history and living
arrangements, plus a wealth of other personal and demographic
information.  The government's plan is to establish a computer network
linking every reservation system in the United States to private and
government databases. The network would use data-mining and predictive
software to profile passenger activity and intuit obscure clues about
potential threats, even before the scheduled day of flight.
"This is not fantasy stuff," said Joseph Del Balzo, a former acting
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and a security
consultant working on one of the profiling projects. "This technology,
based on transaction analysis, behavior analysis, gives us a pretty
good idea of what's going on in a person's mind."  ...  Government officials and companies also face questions about
privacy. In interviews, more than a dozen people working on two
parallel projects said they were taking pains to protect individual
privacy. They intend to limit the personal information shared with
airlines and security officials.  But developers face restrictions on
how much information they can use. Industry officials have already
discussed with lawmakers the possible need to roll back some privacy
protections in the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Driver's Privacy
Protection Act to enable them to use more of the credit and
driver's-license data.  Civil liberties activists said they fear the
system could be the beginnings of a surveillance infrastructure that
will erode existing privacy protections. When told about the system,
Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said it would be "a massive complex system of surveillance."
"It really is a profound step for the government to be conducting
background checks on a large percentage of Americans. We've never done
that before," he said. "It's frightening."  Some critics also worry
that law enforcement authorities will be tempted to use it for broader
aims, such as snaring deadbeat parents or profiling for drug couriers.
"If you can profile for terrorists, you can profile for other things,"
said Richard M. Smith, an independent computer security and privacy
specialist. "The computer technology is so cheap and getting so much
cheaper, you just have to be careful: Turn up the volume a little bit,
and we just use the air transportation system to catch everybody."...
The systems under development would include a thousand or more minute
details and computer-derived conclusions about a person's travel,
daily activity over time and whether he or she has coordinated
activity with other passengers, possibly on other flights, according
to the groups developing the systems.  Two leading prototypes are
being developed. One group is led by HNC Software, a risk-detection
specialist that works for credit card issuers, telephone companies,
insurers and others. HNC is working with several companies, including
PROS Revenue Management, which has access to seating records of
virtually every U.S. passenger, and Acxiom Corp., one of the world's
largest data-marketing companies, which collects such information as
land records, car ownership, projected income, magazine subscriptions
and telephone numbers.  Officials at both HNC and Accenture said they
take care with the personal information their systems collect and
parse. The HNC prototype, for instance, does not link a passenger's
personal information to a passenger's threat index. Officials also
pledged that there will be no racial profiling, in part because
ethnicity often has no bearing on potential risk.  The HNC prototype
uses software known as neural networks, which can "learn" subtle
patterns and relationships by processing millions of records, to
predict when a particular transaction is likely to be fraudulent. The
company already uses neural networks software to accurately profile
the activity of millions of credit card owners, telephone callers and
people receiving insurance benefits to crack down on fraud.  The
Accenture system also creates a threat index, using massive computing
power and relational database software. It examines travel data to
look for things such as routes involving odd destinations or flying
patterns. To search for threads linking individuals, the system will
sift huge amounts of travel records, real estate histories and "seven
layers" of passenger associates, according to Accenture partner Brett
Ogilvie.  For instance, it would note if an individual lived at the
former address of someone considered high-risk. Theoretically, the
system could be calibrated to watch for people with links to
restaurants or other places thought to be favored by terrorist
cells. It might also note phone calls and match individuals against
government watch lists. A potential link to a threatening character or
region could boost a passenger's score, he said
....  Paul Werbos, a
senior National Science Foundation official and a neural networks
specialist, said such systems need to be used carefully. While there
is no doubt that profiling can improve security, Werbos said, "we have
to be very careful not to create punishments, disincentives, for being
different from average."
