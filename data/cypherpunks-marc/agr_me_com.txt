Per the above, it seems to me that some thought should be given about the advisability of logging instances where a PRNG is seeded before sufficient entropy is collected. It's at least conceivable that the logs will not be protected as tightly as the PRNG state (logs might be collected and sent to a compromised central server, for example), so an attacker might be able to examine the logs of many nodes on a network to find the few whose PRNGs are poorly seeded and focus his resources on breaking them.

So Jon and Daniel have it all taken care of? We can just relax, and their admirable work, which solves all known and still undiscovered problems, will make its way into every security product by the sheer weight of its superiority?  No protocol issues to resolve? No need for people looking for weaknesses to brainstorm possible attacks? No need for people who are working on similar problems to meet and share issues and solutions? No need for those who still don't get it to hear from those who do? I can't think of any discipline where the advocacy, relationship-building and cross fertilization that takes place in a conference is needed more than in cryptography, especially in light of the recent disclosures.

Some thoughts:
1. The notion that one can buy security software from a large American company that will reliably thwart the NSA is silly. 2. The notion that one can buy security software from any vendor and use the default settings indefinitely without access to independent cryptographic expertise to advise on new threats is silly. 3. If I were working for NSA tasked with with disrupting the independent cryptographic community's response to the Snowdon revelations, I'd be hard pressed to come up with a better idea than a boycott of the RSA conference.

A simple counter with no overflow would work, of course, but Inexpensive cpu clock chips, like the DS-1307 family, provide a 99 year range with one second resolution and have all the circuitry for dual supply (5 VDC and battery) with very low power (500 na) operation on battery.  Another possible advantage over a straight counter: yy-mm-dd-hh-ss in a time stamp is a lot easier to explain to a judge and jury than a long hexadecimal constant. Here's a data point. I installed a cheap digital video recorder for a surveillance system just over four years ago. It's not connected to the Internet and I never adjusted the clock since installing it. I had to pull a clip off of it last week and the clock was 44 minutes fast. That's about a minute a month.  So if the device grabbed the current NIST beacon signed it with its internal clock and had the resulting certificate time stamped by an external authority once a month, that should be enough to establish minute accuracy.

Those are interesting examples, but intended for fixed mounting in nuclear surveillance situations and presumably very costly. I'm thinking of a much more portable device based on cell phone technology, with video, audio and additional sensors such as motion, compass, GPS (ok, that one's a deal breaker for the kidnapping market). And as a separate question, what can be done with, say, the newer iPhones, given their stronger security model.  For example, two adversarial parties could video and sign the same event with separate phones and then sign each others videos after inspecting them and concluding that each captured the intended information. One could bound the time of the videos by starting with a Nist Beacon value and ending with a time stamp from a service. Arnold Reinhold

It would seem that a camera like this would be useful in a variety of appli=

I love the US Constitution too, but let us not make too much of a morality play about this. There are always reasons for someone to turn on an organization he or she was once loyal to (or appeared to be).  Communism was the biggie in the mid 20th century, but religion, political ideology, money troubles, blackmail over an illicit affair, mental illness, or just a new significant other can all do it. I heard Daniel Ellsberg, the guy who leaked the Pentagon Papers, speak years ago and he said a divorce and new girl friend helped alter his view of the Vietnam War. The United States went from Perl Harbor to the Invasion of Normandy in just over 2-1/2 years. I suspect NSA put a lot of changes in place within months after Snowden. The point is you cannot have vast quantities of secrets circulating freely on digital networks accessible to thousands of people, no matter how well vetted, even if your goals and methods are pure as can be, and not expect major leaks from time to time. Securing US secrets is one of NSA two missions. They should have gotten the message with Pvt. Manning. Obviously they did not. Arnold Reinhold
