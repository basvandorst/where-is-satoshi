This message was just commented on the main Cygwin list as being the result=
 of running McAfee antivirus.  The solution is: disable the "buffer overrun=
 protection"

what it means.
ady running
It means literally what it says: you cannot start more than one X server at=
 a
time (on the same ports).
You probably are running into another problem and when you don't see the xt=
or the application you were expecting to see you try to start it again... w=
work, the original problem is still there.  Wild guess: you have anti-virus=
 or
"internet security" software that block the X server ports.
