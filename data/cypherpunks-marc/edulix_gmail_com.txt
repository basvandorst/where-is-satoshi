Hi people:
As most of the people around the world, I find really troubling all
these revelations. Of course we suspected this kind of shit, we just
didn't know the gory and surprising details.
I work in a libre-software e-voting project [0] which has been
deployed in some interesting initiatives already [1] and we strive to
make it as secure as possible [2], though our resources are currently
limited. Of course, anyone is welcome to join and help us.
Do you have any specific recommendation for securing the servers of
the authorities who do the tallying, in light of latest revelations?
it seems really difficult to get away from the NSA if they want to get
inside the servers.
Kind regards,
