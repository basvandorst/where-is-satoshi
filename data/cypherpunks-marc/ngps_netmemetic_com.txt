@_subject: Windows Internet security tools 
Hi,                                                                             I reckon this is a good crowd to ask this of. I'm helping a Win98-using friend acquire some Internet usage security.  I
think he needs at least the following: 1. An anti-virus package. (Google reports a free-for-personal-use one at
2. PGP,  My friend uses Eudora. What is a good Eudora PGP
shell? (I use GPG. I'm assuming GPG interoperates with, say, PGP 7.)
3. A disk/file encryption tool. Any to recommend? (Free for personal use
4. One of those personal firewall/anti-snoopware thingy?
5. Anything else?
TIA. Cheers.                                                                    (Please cc replies. I'm not subscribed to the list.)
