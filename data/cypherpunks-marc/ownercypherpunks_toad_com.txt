@_author: OTCBB: DPRI 
@_subject: Undervalued Growth Stock 
OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:
EMRG from $ .60 to $2.50 in 10 days for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!!!
DICE from $ .49 to $1.62 in 7 days for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!!!
HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. (OTCBB: DPRI)
BUY AT $1.25
SELL TARGET $4.60 = DIAMOND PLAY !!!!
MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE THIS WEEK FOR DPRI !!!
Revenues for DPRI, a 10-year old, fully-reporting company, have  skyrocketed 600% higher this
year to over $8 Million on substantial US Government and Insurance Industry contracts. DPRI's
client list of over 50 major insurance companies includes Allstate, Fireman's Fund, Travelers,
Liberty Mutual, Prudential, Hartford, and Nationwide.
We are expecting significant news this week regarding increasing revenue and contract
expansion from DPRI's Fortune 500 customer base. The stock has already bounced sharply from
its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We think the stock could easily climb
above $4 in less than a month.
WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS DPRI MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE
MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!
