Yesterday I caught Keith Olberman's show on MSNBC when he was announcing that Fox News will be hiring Dennis Miller for occasional guest commentaries.  Keith Olberman is known for his funny quips, but yesterday he did a drop-dead hilarious impression of an extended Dennis Miller rant.  Only this time, it was Keith Olberman ranting against Fox's "We decide, you obey" reporting style.  The writing and delivery were perfect, and he really hit his target.
I've nearly boycotted TV news lately, so that was the first time I've seen his show.  I'll Tivo it for entertainment value if nothing else.

Right, a fair point.  I've heard cypherpunks say that and I do think Clay was being a bit hard on them.  To place the cypherpunks in the best possible light, perhaps better than they deserve, we might say it's sort of like criticizing Nikola Tesla for not routing an AC power grid through rural Tennessee.
Yes, I have seen statements to that effect.
Mind you, I only had occasional exposure to the cypherpunks list via Hettinga's feed.  Which is probably fine because I have heard that receiving the cypherpunks list is like drinking from a fire hose, and Hettinga seems to forward the really informative and entertaining stuff from Tim May, Adam Back, et al anyway.
Right, on the one hand it's cool that hordes of otherwise ordinary computer users can become interested in "darknets," but on the other hand it's a bit scary that the sheer scale of it is orders of magnitude beyond getting a whiskey in a speakeasy.  This could either thoroughly discourage the government or motivate them to do really draconian things like requiring computers and chips to meet a specific government specification which severely limits how they function.  They're working on it.
Yes, a good observation from the time of the first big "War on Drugs," that is, the demon alcohol, wrecker of homes and corrupter of public morals, as anyone who has watched "Cops" can attest.  Now I need a drink -- a glass of port sounds good.
