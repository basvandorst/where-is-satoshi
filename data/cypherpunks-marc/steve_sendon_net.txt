This will be a simple threat to mitigate. The government simply needs to require that every male carry a Foreskin
Certificate of Authenticity.  Obviously for women, a similar certificate will
be necessary to authenticate breasts and pregnancies.  Particularly paranoid
regimes might also view moles and bunyans with suspicion and mandate further
security measures.  For the public safety, of course.

More to the point, such systems provide the imprecision and convenience which
some rigid and domineering minds need in order to impose their more subtle
and complex belief systems on others.
Only by convention.
Which are only useful if they are used as creative alternatives instead of
forms within which convenient and common ideas can be re-expressed.
Beware of false dictionaries and lexicons.
Intellectual freedom and speech is only as good as the persons who excercise
it -- and in this culture, it is mediocre at best.
But of course for effect the statesman's sage utterings are unequalled.
You're losing it.
Or pretend.

Quoting Major Variola (ret) (mv
Speaking of which, my subscription lapsed between October 11th, 1998 and
August 10, 2000.  I'm interested in filling in the gap as I have an otherwise
complete (I think) archive from 1992.  I would use the inet-one archive, but
it is in html format and I much prefer using my mail-reader of choice: mutt.
The source for my copy of the archives is both from my subscription and from
the archives which Ryan Lacky put together.  Since I believe those files are
no longer online (in UN*X mailbox format) I wouldn't mind making them
available.  However, I don't have access to a site which can take the
bandwidth of many downloads.
The compiled collection is 530 MB uncompressed.  The sources are 300MB plus
50MB or so for 2000 and 2001.

This does not follow.
In my opinion people should be scared shitless.  Your government (as well as
mine) are engaging in not merely illegal, but barbaric practices in so far as
`recruiting' is concerned.  The longer such practices are permitted to
continue, the more that the perpetrators are allowed to become emboldened by
their successes lack of criminal sanction.
Given enough time, these people will, for all intents and purposes, be
unstoppable and will come to view their ability and right to subvert, coerce,
enlist, steal, threaten, and manipulate as evidence, prima facia, of their
natural superiority over the very people they should be protecting from the
very threat which they now pose.
John is completely correct.  The current practices as they pertain to
`recruiting' are utterly odious and abhorrent and should be exposed and
No shit.

Who does?  Only fascist regulators who can't get off unless they're grinding a

legislating in order to self-justify their values, no matter how fucked-up
those values might be.  To do otherwise might hurt their future employability.
I suppose so.

[list stagnation redux]
It's a rather widespread trend.  These days, people seem content to relegate
wild futurist speculations and detailed, meaningful discussion on various
technical fronts to science fiction works or to refereed journals.  Usenet
(and the mailing lists of my acquaintance) has for a long time been a sewer
where people go to fight over their personalities under the guise of
conversation.  But there is virtually no open dialogue on weighty technical
matters.  So much for the so-called weapon of openness.
There is an up-side to this.  Legislators, cops (of all sorts), sociologists
and the like, as a group, will fail to acquire an inkling of the deeper issues
of meaty technologies even as they are deployed by corporations, large and
small.  Their `experiments' in social control (GAK, wiretapping laws,
bioethics regulation, etc.) will be for the most part uninformed and therefore
compromised, if not doomed to failure.
In the meantime, scientists, programmers, engineers, and technologists will
carry on with their work quietly; routing around the damage of the government
until it is no longer relevant.
And from where I sit, that isn't a bad thing at all.
