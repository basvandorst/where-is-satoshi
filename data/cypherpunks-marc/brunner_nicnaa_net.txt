Howdy Perry,
(a) I don't know MIT's attorney, and (b) I wouldn't ever call him or her
when I could reach someone I know, and (c) what would you expect an attorney
to say?
Yeah, but, home truths. There are registrars who will get out of bed at
night for a customer, and registrars who could give a shit if hell froze.
Just like ISPs and LEOs, neh?
Picking a registrar with a market share in the top 10 means that you get
1/share's worth of attention, which means 1/1488700 of Dotster's attention
(using 1/15 daily market share graph). Now, was that at the NetSol $35/yr
price point for customer care, or the GoDaddy $6.95/yr price point for
customer care.
I suppose everyone thinks that it (for some value of "it") can't happen
to them, and that if it does, a wicked small amount of money will still
do more than the oil that lights the lamps at Hanukkah, because bad acts
are rare and all the dimes pile up into a shared fate insurance fund.
Well, now I'm really going to bed.

Free advice. Bruce, Cliff and Chuck are people. Yes, even Chuck is a people.
You want prompt service, you ask nice and you ask the right people and you
don't assume there are facts not in evidence, like errors or malfeasence,
when you could be solving the problem, before the facts could be in evidence.
My phone isn't going to ring, so I'm going to bed.

I've forwared to Bruce Tonkin, who I know personally, at MIT,
and Cliff Page, who I don't know as well, at Dotster, Steve's
note. These are the RC reps for each registrar.

of course that use case was considered. it was offered as the rational for default (unconditional) rapid update, though it does fall into the stupid-dns-tricks bucket.

there exists a free speech application for fast flux hosting networks, and its in connecticut, not china.
(during the icann gnso pdp on fast flux hosting the above assertion was generally dismissed)

the authoritative and secondary servers for the "ÙÙØ³Ø±." zone were unreachable, a circumstance which existed a year ago for the .ht zone.
the authoritative and secondary servers for the ".eg" zone were mutually unreachable.
wireline dialtone was prevalent during the prefix withdrawal period.
suggestions for oob control, 56kb tech and (signed) zone transfer would be useful.
graceful conversion to a sparse 56kb and vsat connectivity regime may be a general form of robustness.
