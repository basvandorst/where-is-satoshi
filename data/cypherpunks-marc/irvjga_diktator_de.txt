Company Profi|e:
BIOGENERICS LTD is a domestic oil and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a technology leader in todays Energy market. The companys shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic 0i| and Gas is Bushs  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principa| business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, held significant positions in biotechno|ogy, fiber optics and other techno|ogy ventures that management be|ieved could propel shareho|der value.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oil & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation  an oil and gas technology |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas play was natural.
The Companys other holdings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management p|ans to fi|e a Form 10 in the immediate future.
