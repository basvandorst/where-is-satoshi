I feel the same. So far looks like "we dont know who developers are" is the
biggest argument of Jake's camp to stay sort of  reserved.
However, Rotor has been released for Windows in the last 36 hours. Its
currently a pre-release   and cert for auto update
should be fixed soon
It should be no surprise that its carbon copy, and that the project is
genuine, and in its early days.

Thats malicious intepretation. Knowing about backdoors is excellent for
weeding them out from libraries, dont you think?
What makes you think same knowledge cannot be used to start the abandoned
branch of Tor successfully.
