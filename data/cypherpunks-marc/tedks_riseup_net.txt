Not much actual information, but it's nifty that bitcoin-mining malware
is maybe using Tor hidden services for command and control.

So from what it seems, the malware included a bitcoin miner that perhaps is
to report found blocks / sub-hashes (? is that a term; i.e. if it works in
a mining pool) to a server, perhaps this site in question.

I've had numerous hidden services hosting various different services,

This implies a pretty easy business model:
      * rent botnet proxies at some cost
      * make google accounts over botnets, farming the captchas out at
        some other cost
      * sell google accounts for bitcoins at cost + other cost + profit
        margin over a tor hidden service
      * profit
You could probably do the account creation on-demand so you had no
inventory buildup, even. If you started getting lots of demand, you
could start pre-registering accounts.
This one's a freebie for anyone on this list with more time than me.
Since I have a Google account, I'd like to say that I will never do

This particular script that is currently being hyped up on Reddit as
"de-anonymizing most Tor hidden servers" simply makes too many
assumptions to be feasible.
Yes, this sort of attack is feasible in principle, and this script will
probably work if you find a hidden service that is also a relay and is
also a publicly reachable HTTP server, but saying it can be carried out
against most hidden services is simply false as a matter of fact.
Hidden services don't need to be reachable from the Internet. They don't
need to have accurate clocks. And as a result, a lot of them aren't
vulnerable to a program on the Internet that is being marketed as
reliably de-anonymizing hidden services.
To summarize:
      * This is not a novel attack
      * This particular variant of the attack ("clockskewer") is not
        effective against many if not most hidden services
      * The people claiming it does on Reddit are scare-mongering Tor
        for karma, and that irritates me as someone who likes Tor and
        wants people who need more-secure systems to research Tor and
        see the stable, well-tested tool that it is, rather than hype
        from Reddit.

You've been pretty vocal in your opposition to anyone helping this Tor
volunteer, and now you're alleging that he was using his own exit node
to do illegal things?
Not only does that not make sense in the slightest (Tor clients can
select exit nodes -- why would he select his own?), by your own logic
it's becoming suspicious. A lot of times the guy who screams the most
about the culpability of privacy advocates has the most nefarious
influence to hide.
So either there's a breakdown in our logic, or you're getting paid by
the Illuminati to spread FUD about Tor on mailing lists. Which is it? (I
notice you haven't yet denied it, which is itself very suspect...)

As far as I can tell, most of those accusations come from one person,
and have no base in reality.
It's a common cognitive bias to assume that bad things happen to bad
people, and good things happen to good people. This is called the Just
World Fallacy, and it's so powerful it can make otherwise intelligent
technologists accuse their colleagues of being secret kiddie-porn

Well, there are the following options:

        we are deceived by this (in this world, you play at level 2,

But it's also possible for a mask to lie beneath the mask, for him to be
insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane. And so on and so
forth all the way down the rabbit hole.
I'm sure if we asked him what level he played at, he'd only respond "one
level higher than you." It's definitely a great show.

I understand your point, but the fact remains that the socio-economic
populations that produce people capable of making homebrew nuclear
weapons and the socio-economic populations that get attacked by drones
are mostly distinct. My earlier point stands if you replace "terror
groups" with "extra-legal terror groups."
It's possibly a sad fact, in the same sense that if the USSR didn't have
nukes, and thus MAD didn't exist, most of Eurasia might be an atomic
wasteland by now.

It seems pretty clear that this is in fact not why the Navy funded Tor.
Virtually all science in the US is funded by the military in some form.
The stuff that isn't funded by the military is funded by the NSA, and
the stuff that isn't funded by either is funded by the NSF (which is
probably just a front group for the military; or at least functionally
is, as is most of the American government).
Saying "look, this thing was funded by the military" is just not useful.
By that metric, virtually all computer science is a hidden backdoor. You
have to be more specific.

This makes things slightly more difficult for us, but not impossible,

There are any number of small programmatic transformations we can apply

IANAL. TINLA.
The GPLv3+ contains this sort of patent protection, as does I believe
the Apache license in later versions.
BSD advocates, I think, are not interested in total freedom in the
world. This is a CONSEQUENCE or OUTCOME of a choice, not the choice
I find frequently that the dispute between BSD and GPL advocates usually
boils down to consequentialist morals on the GPL side, and deontological
or rule-based morals on the BSD side. While a BSD advocate believes it
is immoral to restrict action in any way, regardless of consequence, a
GPL advocate believes it is irrelevant what actions are restricted or
allowed, but rather that the vital fact is the total freedom in the
world, or the consequence of whatever actions take place.
