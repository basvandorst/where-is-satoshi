@_subject: Re: how to use mobile phone GPS without a SIM card? 
I would suggest to go ahead and review the link of Steve Pointer. Although I=
 can=E2=80=99t dismiss the chance of a similar function like the one mention=
ed before, I believe that the functionality of the A-GPS is the culprit here=
" there's one that says : if (no_sim()) disable_gps();
