@_subject: error 
Hi I am a new user of Mysql and have received an error.
I enter my C drive using the MS-DOS prompt. I then access the mysql\bin
I then type "mysql". which welcomes me to Mysql Monitor.
I then try to create a database called "database01" by typing "mysqladmin
create database01\g" but i get the following error:-
              Error 1064:You have an error in your SQL syntax near
'mysqladmin create database01' at line 1.
I would be very grateful if you could get back to me about this as i am
using it for a college project.
