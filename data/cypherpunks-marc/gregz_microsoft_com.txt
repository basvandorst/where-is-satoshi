Well, with an unimaginable amount of storage it is possible to shave a few =
bits off of AES. =
As {Bogdanov, Andrey and Khovratovich, Dmitry and Rechberger, Christian} sa=
y in Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES (ASIACRYPT 2011) [PDF at http:/=
"This approach for 8-round AES-128 yields a key recovery with computational=
 complexity about 2^125.34, data complexity 2^88, memory complexity 2^8, an=
d success probability 1."
It's that 2^88 that requires a LOT of storage. I'm not sure if that 2^88) i=
s in bits or AES blocks, but let's assume bits. Facebook is said to store a=
bout 2^62 bits, so we are looking at something 2^26 times larger than Faceb=
ook's data storage.
tion storage facility,
Any (reliable) estimates on how big?
