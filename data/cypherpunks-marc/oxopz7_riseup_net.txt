No results about the last two books Peter! :'(
What about these books:
SSL TLS Essentials  Securing the Web
SSL and TLS Theory and Practice
Implementing SSL TLS Using Cryptography and PKI
Actually; I want to focus on the algorithms that are used on it.
Not just know or implement and doing things with these protocols!
Cheers to all,
Best Regards,

Hello everybody!
I hope all are fine, and doing well!
I'm good member :) I hope you will accept me!
I like to ask about GNU PG, if is more safe than other kind of software!
that talks about Crypto ?
I like to ask also about good resources in Crypto, specially about SSL/TLS?
Have a nice day,
