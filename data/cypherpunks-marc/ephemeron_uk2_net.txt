============================== START ==============================
Since OpenOffice aims to be a complete office forms solution, I
was wondering if it would be possible to incoporate support for
the printing of business cards.
I know business cards can be produced by copying, pasting and
aligning one rectangular group of objects repeatedly on a page,
but this seems laborious. I was thinking of a system where you
design just one card and have Writer or Draw produce ten of those
for printing on one sheet of card stock.
Such a system could also be used to produced labels, sticker,
post cards and other forms that require multiple impressions per
printed sheet.

It is. I made the mistake of wresting with File->New->Business
Cards. I had trouble making the hard-coded approach of the biz
cards wizard work. Thanks for the pointer.
