Dunno, maybe you're right, I couldn't get it to happen in the lab
with phenols when I was a chem student without actually burning it. I
tried. (wasn't supposed to but I was curious). Biphenols, yes. Or
something close enough to TCDD that I didn't care. Actually burning
245T, and 24D for that matter will indeed produce TCDD. As to whether
or not overcooking these phenols produces it, well, I wouldn't doubt it. But overcooking would still be a faulty process. BTW, burning just about ANYTHING with chlorine in it will produce
I don't know there brother nobody, I just keep reading over and over
again, folks using 245T, 24D and TCDD practically interchangably. They are not the same chemicals, not at all. I read things like
"245T, a form of dioxin" and "Agent Orange, a strong dioxin".
You say TCDD is a breakdown product of 245T, others say it is a
manufacturing byproduct, others say it is the same thing.
Well, most farmers in the world still don't have nearly the output that
the "chemically dependant brainwashed, braindead amerikan farmer" does,
except perhaps those other hi output ag industries from Germany, the
netherlands and such. All of which are of course, heavily chem dependent. Herbicides have existed a hell of a lot longer than 50 years, even
so-called modern chlorinated herbicides have been around since the late 1800s. The reasons the "chemically dependant brainwashed, braindead amerikan farmer" is becomming exinct has a lot more to do with international corporate farming and economics of multinational monopolies like
Archer Daniels Midland, the darling of the NPR crowd, than it
does the use of herbicides, pesticides and fertilzers.   Perhaps you are right on all cases, that agent orange
and all phenoxyl herbicides are the devils spawn and the true root of all evil. My imagination balks at it, perhaps because
I don't share your clarity of vision. However, I do know some
of the chemists at Dow Midland who were directly involved in
Dows work with 245T, and to follow your line of thinking is
to say that these folks are the fine agents of the great
satan himself, heirs to those nice folks who stirred the pot
so vigorously in europe back in the 40s.
My imagination balks at it, perhaps because these
folks simply are not like that, and I have read a lot of
the papers, I have done some of the chemistry and have learned
in an empirical way that these questions are all a great deal more complicated than these flat statements
like "Agent Orange is the blame for all the ''bad
things''" suggest. This is all real touchy stuff, I have been around
pretty much half a century and have been litterally
up to my neck in this stuff. (Yes, this *STUFF*). I don't take it lightly, and I don't buy into any
corporate line, as a corporation is almost by
definition incapable of telling any truth when there is
any bad news. But little snippits that say ag/chem
is evil, and we are good because we say it is evil
are pretty much a waste of everyones time.

Agent Orange is a 1-124-1 mixture of n-butyl esters,
245T 2-4-5-trichlorophenoxacetic acid (C8,H5,Cl3,O3), and 24D
2-4-dichloro-phenoxacetic acid (C8,H6,Cl2,O3).
TCDD or, 2-3-7-8-tetrachlorodibenzo-P-dioxin (C12,H4,Cl4,O2), is a
CONTAMINATE artifact of the heat exchangers used in the reaction process not a constituent as so often stated. None of this stuff is what any of us want in our dinner salad, however
the differences between 245T,24D the most researched herbicides in the
world and TCDD are huge. Currently, aside from dioxin like pcbs (which are no longer
manufactured in the US, and wouldn't be around at all hardly
if it weren't for the americans and computer users love
of electricity and plastic lawn furniture) the only real use of dioxin is
in bleaching paper pulp. The understanding of dioxin is still incomplete
and with all the new studies in gene research on, folks are learning
some pretty interesting stuff about some theoretical benificial
capabilities of dioxin. In the short term, it's abilities to bind
up lipophilic chemicals so they can be pissed out as urine, and in the
long run, as a vector for non intrusive reprogramming of cells.
Chlorinated herbicides have been around since the late 1800s, and have
litterally made all the difference in the abilities to produce food
in the last century. While the ability to produce food in the 20th century has produced all kinds of new global problems, and food
is still used as a political tool, the problems of world wide
starvation are problems of politics, not agriculture. The techology
exists, and chemicals like 24D and 245T are among the reasons why.
Bad shit happened in the land of bad things to a lot of people. I've lost friends, close friends, to health proplems resulting from
exposure to agent orange, so I don't take this lightly. If the herbicide
had been manufactured with a priority on quality instead of the usual gov focus on low bid and quantity, it is at least conceivable
that this horror wouldn't be facing those folks now. As far as I know the only controlled studies done on agent orange were
done by the principle contractor Dow chemical, and the studies
were done in Midland Michigan. Those studies pointed heavily at TCDD contamination. As far as I know, those studies have not
been refuted. I am not a biochemist, and I don't even play one on TV, but I do
know how to read, and I wish that if folks wanted to report on this
stuff, they would get their facts straight.

How is this legal? How is it legal to outlaw reception of radio transmissions under the FCC act of 1934? I have never understood this. I keep expecting at
some point, someone will somehow come up with a good reason to take a monitoring claim to the
US supreme court and get all these laws tossed
aside. But I guess I am expecting too much.
For all of it's faults, the fcc act of '34 established in law that the air waves are
public property, that broadcasters operate
under license and don't own jack shit, and
that broadcasters must act in "the public interest, convenience, and necessity."
Even during war time in the 40's it was
established that anyone could "monitor" as the air waves are public property. However,
it was further established that one could
not act upon reception of certain broadcasts
with malicious intent and blah blah blah.
How in the hell have all these anti-monitoring
laws gotten passed? Do any of our lawmakers have any clue how the law works at all? This is sickening. *WE THE PEOPLE* own the airwaves. PERIOD.

Let me restate for clarity, "no one can get access to the data
outside the limitations, et al."
Simply put, (aside from the usual caveat of "with infinite time and resources") it can't be done in the sense of you and I sharing a document or some such model.
Way too many variables/paths/unknowns.
"it" I suppose means the "distributed network application". Using the
term "no one" makes this whole idea pretty much impossible. "No one"
exludes the sufficiently motivated who are willing to go to any lengths.
Brute force in its actual sense pretty much always works. Also, when you state that your given scenario is "clearly the real
goal" you have already discarded a whopping number of variables, all
of which may bear on the challenge.
*I* don't know that "this is clearly the real goal of TCPA and Palladium" at all. I accept your opinion as your opinion. I believe you are sincere
in interest of discussion. However, it certainly is not my opinion at all.
I am not at all clear on what exactly the problem is that TCPA and Palladium are supposed to solve. I presume, until I can be shown otherwise that "it" is a tool to further expand the power of patent and copywrite holders (or more to the point, their barristers) to impose their will on my freedom of speech. Since I don't want to play the part of the fellow who won't be convinced, all I ask is to be shown in clear terms EXACTLY what the problem is, and
how EXACTLY this problem is solved by this technology. When I mean exactly, I mean in simple go/no-go logic. I don't need nor particularly
want to see the technical specs. There are those out there, and here as well, who are much more qualified to review all that.
