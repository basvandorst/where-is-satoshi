I wanted to announce a preview version (0.0) of my fully free (libre)
and open source operating system loosely based on concepts from the
Tails Linux distribution...
It is called "heads", and more can be seen at heads takes it's basic workflow concepts from Tails, but with a few
quirks of its own. It provides a grsecurity patched kernel, and more
security features, along with elegant, de-poetterized minimalism.
The base system used for heads is Devuan ( which was
made as an answer to Debian switching to systemd, and the same way heads
was made - as an answer to Tails switching to systemd.

I'll try to enable lurker tomorrow.
Perhaps a poor choice of wording. I had the torification in mind...
sudo is not enabled for luther except in the case of tomb(1). Use 'su'
Also see this screencast: (note on how to change the root password to something easier)
MATE is not included in this 0.0 release. And I'm even contemplating
whether not to include it all in future releases. AwesomeWM is doing its
job well and if I add a few more features it will be quite usable for
everyone. Also helps me to avoid policykit and consolekit crap.
Let me know :)
