provided to Dmitry after Dmitry's arrest by FBI agents at last year's

Bill -
Can you forward this to the cypherpunks list? I think there's a lot of
people out there who will make great speakers.
Well folks, it's about that time.
I hope to see several list members either speak at, or attend the show:
Papers and presentations are now being accepted for the Black Hat Briefings
2002 conference. The conference is held from July 31-August 1, 2002 at the
Caesars Palace Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas, NV, USA. Papers and requests
to speak will be received and reviewed until May 1, 2002.
Please read the full announcement at:
