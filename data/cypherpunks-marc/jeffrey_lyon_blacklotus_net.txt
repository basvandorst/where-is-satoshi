I wouldn't have thought that PRQ would have any significant protection in place.

I'm surprised it took this long for the DDoS train to pull into the station.

For the record, I would never remove a customer because a congressman
or senator asked for it, however, I would deny service to persons with
outstanding felony warrant(s).

The largest attacks we have solid proof on are 20+ Gbps. The only
larger ones that i've seen were in company's marketing collateral vs.
real life.

I'm certain there are thresholds to that. Carrier grade mitigation
solutions will start low and ramp up to 5, 6, 7, etc. figures
depending on the attack and amount of bandwidth to be filtered among
other variables.

< 1 Gbps attacks used to be standard issue but as of the past 90 days
we have been seeing 2 - 8 Gbps a lot more frequently.

We see a lot of the UDP dest 0. Depending on what you're
hosting/protecting you can ACL a lot of the unneeded ports and
protocols (easy) then focus on using appliances (commercially
available or home grown if you're so inclined) to identify and scrub
out the ambiguous traffic (a lot more difficult).

We have seen a recent trend of attackers "legitimately" purchasing
servers to use for attacks. They'll setup a front company, attempt to
make the traffic look legitimate, and then launch attacks from their
"legitimate" botnet.
