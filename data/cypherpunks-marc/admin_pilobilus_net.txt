In my mind the sudden appearance of that momentarily almost-famous
"pole dancer girlfriend" of Snowden's is of a piece with the rest
of The Snowden Affair:  It raises more questions than it answers,
and adds more reasons to suspect a double game.
Did the "pole dancer girlfriend" ever exist, and is that really
her?  I will assume so, for the sake of a fun story.  What are the
odds that she has travelled more than one mile in any direction
since Ed went walkabout, without that motion being logged for
analysis by a consortium of TLAs?  Other than "she has always
worked for us and is still passing polygraph exams," how could her
bona fides as a person of no interest be so confidently endorsed
by the public servants who let her walk away?  If on the other
hand Russia worked some hocus pocus on her behalf, why have public
officials and partisan propaganda mills that already call Snowden
a Russian agent remained silent on that subject?
Painting the young lady in question as a Russian agent who used
her pole dancing skills to steal U.S. secrets would not be hard:
The story sells itself.  Part two of the story would be how she
fluttered away free as a bird to the waiting welcome of her
Russian paymasters:  First Benghazi, now Boris and Natasha in a
Moscow love nest?  It's an outrageous story that would suit many
of our partisan political propagandists very nicely right about...
now.  But all I hear so far is crickets.

This, for starters:
Questions raised by anomalies and inconsistencies present in the
original reports of The Snowden Affair and the PRISM documents
have not been resolved.
We have not physically met any of the players in this game; all we
have to go on is propaganda, that is, stories created for the
purpose of persuading us to adopt certain beliefs and
perspectives.  Propaganda is not necessarily a bad thing, nor does
it always indicate deception:  But to take the story presented at
face value and proceed as if one has positive knowledge of the
events depicted is at best a hazardous approach:  Particularly
when a story originates inside agencies whose stock in trade
includes deception and manipulation of friend and foe as routine
daily missions.
My take on The Snowden Affair is deliberately contrarian.  Every
press outlet in the world takes the story at face value and
questions nothing about its basic premises; the only permissible
disagreement is whether one should be "for or against" Ed Snowden.
Jumping on either bandwagon contributes nothing.  In this
situation, the more inconvenient a question is to the basic
premise of the story, the more valuable it may be to our
understanding of the substance and meaning of the story.
I never insinuated that Snowden "could not have had a girlfriend."
 What I have said is that the absence of any indications of a
particular girlfriend other than three words spoken by Ed Snowden,
raised the question of whether that particular person did exist.
Now we do have fairly persuasive evidence of her existence, to
integrate into our interpretation of The Snowden Saga - if we
remain interested enough to bother.
In The Snowden Saga, Lindsay initially existed only as three words
spoken by Ed Snowden when describing the way of life he sacrificed
to undertake his heroic quest:  "Pole dancer girlfriend."  The
appearance of a person named Lindsay in the new film, along with
the story that he met her in a bar in Japan and that she followed
him to Hawaii, is the first corroborating evidence that this
person ever existed.  Now she appears as the most influential
person in Ed's life during the time frame when he decided to
abandon his entire way of life and become a fugitive facing life
in prison for the sake of a Holy Quest.
Questioning whether Ed Snowden was really a free agent, vs. an
unwitting agent exploited by a U.S. (or other) intelligence
operation, is obviously out of bounds.  So that's what I do.
To date, nothing that well informed members of the public did not
already know or confidently guess about the capabilities and
activities of the NSA has been revealed by any of the releases
attributed to Snowden.  I also see that every supposedly
controversial legal or policy issue raised by The Snowden Affair
was already settled in the intelligence community's favor, in
Courts and Congress, years earlier:  The most genuinely
controversial document released was the first one, an order
demanding Verizon's call records; that was a fight the
intelligence community was well prepared to win and they did so
Anyone who studies the history and current activities of the
intelligence community learns early on that final answers are very
elusive.  Insiders describe the intelligence world as a
"wilderness of mirrors."  Elaborate and long-running deceptions
are business as usual:  Familiar examples include the complete
British control of German intelligence networks in England during
World War II, Soviet placement and maintenance of high level
double agents inside the CIA during the first Cold War, and
numerous false flag operations by everybody, such as Israel's
failed Lavon Affair.  Observers inside the intelligence services
are little better off than those on the outside when it comes to
getting the straight story:  Histories created for internal
consumption by outfits like the CIA routinely gloss over
controversies and endorse falsehoods.
In today's world it is not possible to stop leakers from leaking.
But it is very possible to create controlled leakers of one's
own, and use them to pull public attention away from the genuine
article, saturate relevant press resources, and keep legal and
legislative overseers busy chasing after one's own chosen
allegations and indiscretions.  If Ed Snowden did not exist, it
would be necessary to create him.
I have no reason to believe that Ed Snowden is anything other than
what he appears to be:  An idealist who has been used as a means
to an end.  This leaves the question, used by whom and for what
ends?  One can choose a side to take and adjust one's beliefs
accordingly, or leave questions that do not yet have answers open.
That is why I thought the LeGuin quote was very appropriate in
the present context:
"Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven. They do not
learn this by learning. They do not work it by working. They do
not reason it by using reason. To let understanding stop at what
cannot be understood is a high attainment. Those who cannot do it

Other tracking vectors available to State level actors include:
* Owning and operating a large fraction of the routers in the
network.  This can be concealed very effectively by using a cloud
server to host all the routers in one place, with exits all over the
world via transparent proxies.  "All in one place" means, monitored
and manipulated in realtime to shape traffic and identify users.
* Monitoring exit node traffic to record browser fingerprints,
cleartext of any data transmitted between the TOR user and any
server on the Internet, and associating these with behavior patterns
indicating a personal interests profile, likely time zones, etc.
* Diverting exit node traffic through a hostile router equipped with
"real" Certificate Authority signing keys negates SSL completely -
connecting to a server via SSH over TOR is the same as connecting to
the server without SSH, if your adversary is NSA.
* Injecting exploits and implants into the TOR user's inbound
traffic from sites on the "normal" Internet, custom tailored to
"climb out of" the TOR browser and take over the user's system.
All of the above are within known capabilities at NSA and, most
likely, Israeli, Chinese and Russian security services.  It is
possible that their biggest problem is tripping over each other's
feet while interfering with TOR users.
Any contact with NSA owned (Facebook) or NSA partner (Google)
services creates big, greasy fingerprints that make tracking anyone
anywhere much easier.
A VPN does not even attempt to conceal the identities of users from
any actor who can watch both ends of the connection.  A VPN will
stop low tech adversaries like MPAA/RIAA goons who go after people
sharing files; NSA and its peers, not so much.  Not to mention that

One-off use of TOR via the TAILS operating system on a "clean"
laptop at an open WiFi router might be enough to prevent you and
your traffic from being logged.
SSH in general and VPN providers in particular are transparent to
outfits like NSA.  Using them with TOR only becomes part of a
profile that eventually narrows down to one user - you.
Maybe not.  Needle vs. haystack and all that.  But again, if you use
the same physical Internet connection to repeatedly do "anonymous"
things, it would be very good if these things were of no real
interest to our Security Services.
I have run TOR relays from time to time.  As long as you are not
running an exit node, nothing bad will happen.  And at least you
know you are adding one "honest" router to the network - unless your
box has been rooted and you don't know who really controls it.
There's mine, for what it's worth.  Te anonymity provided by TOR
(and i2p, Mixmaster, Freenet, etc.) is very limited even in best
case scenarios.  These tools simply can't work when a hostile actor
effectively sees all, knows all, and can fuck with any connection on
demand.  On the brighter side most private, corporate and criminal
attackers would be completely unable to penetrate the security
provided by TOR (or etc.), unless they are in a position to ask the
NSA or a comparable Security Service to do it for them.

place where all the angles are "wrong," and watching the most
merciful thing in the world - the inability of hostile actors to

Couple of things I can see to work on:
* Publicize this as a quantum leap in network security threats,
requiring new trust models and comms protocols across the board,
to every audience that is likely to understand the problem and
respond proactively.
* Review RFC 6973, Privacy Considerations For Internet Protocols,
and work to amplify/expand sections relevant to what we are
learning about large scale threat actors and their behavior as
observed in the wild.  This RFC is only two years old, so changes
now may have a large impact on results later.
* Think about building an ecosystem of repositories for hashes and
signatures, and protocols for monitoring consensus and assigning
relative trust values to reduce reliance on repo signing keys as
guarantors of software integrity.  Developing comms protocols for
this network would also contribute to general solutions for
hardening networks against the capabilities of our new overlords.
* Think hard about open projects to reverse engineer IC chips with
attention to manufacturer sabotage.  It seems to me that the
likely venue for this would be non-aligned nations (so-called)
with a vested interest in pooling their resources to push back
against universal surveillance & sabotage capabilities of the
Superpowers and their special pets.
*  Keep pressure on all fronts already being worked, i.e.
replacing the HTTPS protocol with something that actually works in
the sense of costing a lot more to defeat.  Make the opposition
spend more money when and wherever possible.
Considering the choice of an apparently competent security

The end of "privacy as we know it" is only a dystopian scenario if
the institutions of authoritarian governance survive in the
post-privacy world.  I don't believe they can survive, because the
same network infrastructure that has already made so much formerly
"private" information public also shifts the balance of power away
from established institutions in fundamental ways.
Keeping State and Corporate secrets out of public view is becoming
progressively more difficult, while the mechanism of ad-hoc self
organizing "smart mob" actions arising from the public at large is
an emergent challenge to established power centers.  If and as
these trends continue to accelerate, the nature of political power
will eventually be transformed.
The opposition takes this prospect very seriously, and is fighting
back through automation of intelligence analysis, adaptive enemies
lists, strategic deployment of reputation management,
astroturfing, censorship, adaptive signal boosting and
degradation, spoofing and disinformation, coordination of
conventional propaganda across formerly isolated domains, etc. etc.

continued concentration of power in the hands of a ruling elite.

on the way out.  One way is the continued development of
established trends in information technology's impact on large
scale social behavior.  The other way is the pending collapse of

production and commerce.  Together, these environmental pressures
drive adaptive responses that are /very/ unfavorable to the

That was my first reaction as well:  But on close inspection he

given, while the ability to correlate the collected information
into actionable intelligence can and should be restricted to large
organizations:  "Most privacy laws exist to block government
actions. A few exist to block private institutional actions. But
none exist to block individuals' actions."
I interpret this as a response to the accelerating progress of
open source collection and analysis into contexts formerly
monopolized by State and Corporate actors.  A war of sorts is
already underway on this front; else why is Barrett Brown doing

archives may be weighing heavily on the minds of State and
Corporate strategists.  What good is owning a Panopticon if the
prisoners have data terminals where they can watch the guards and
their employers as they go about their daily lives?
Secrecy as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent of
networked everything, the secrecy tax Julian Assange wrote about
years ago keeps growing and may reach a tipping point where State
and Corporate secrecy no longer pays.
Propaganda as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent
of networked everybody, identity groups and market segments
created and manipulated by broadcast propaganda are running on
inertia.  The 'ego casting' and 'echo chamber' effects that
segregate the Internet today are at best leaky containers whose

to information is the key to controlling whole societies; both
secrecy and propaganda are essential to the operation of any
repressive regime.  Could authoritarian State and Corporate

through deception, bribery and terrorism to the industrialized
mass murder we call warfare.  Try to stop them; if you show signs

govern use a very different definition than the ones the governed
are taught:  State sovereignty is the power to rob, kidnap and
kill withing a given territorial boundary, and to defend these
powers as one's exclusive prerogative.
Anarchists are consistently depicted as violent lunatics opposed
to any form of social order.  The idea that government is based on
the consent of the governed is all well and good in a civics
class, but God forbid someone should try to actually implement
that fine theory by withdrawing their consent from particular
incarnations and/or functions of government.
I would not say so, but broadly speaking, they are directed by

a market is willing to pay enough to support and grow the
project, it can be done.  Are there potential partners and large
scale consumers for "top security through total transparency" to
make an open hardware project viable today?
One potential route would be to broker a deal to pool the
resources of specialty hardware integrators who already have a
market base for high security "solutions."  The Open Office
project pulled off something similar years ago, obtaining major
funding and support from IBM and others who wanted Microsoft out
of their hair.  So, who wants a shot at defending some of their
digital assets from outfits like NSA and GHCQ, badly enough to pay
for it?
The first place I would start shopping this "crypto anarchist"
project around would be State security services - pretty much any
small to mid-sized outfit not in BRICS or FVEYE could be a
potential market for auditable scrambler phones for military
commanders, senior elected officials, diplomatic corps and
double-nought spies.  From there to high performance servers and
workstations would be a natural progression.
I haven't looked at how the Black Phone folks are doing lately,
but that looks like the kind of product line where open hardware
might find its first viable home.
Another consideration:  One needs not necessarily own the facility
where the chips are made:  ISO quality assurance programs already
in place support client access for audit and validation.  A
contract that specifies the client's intrusive presence during
every phase of production and handling would cost extra, but a QA
process that assumes the presence of hostile actors on the shop
floor is definitely possible.  Such a process would also be needed
at a dedicated facility:  One must assume the presence of hostile
actors there, too.

That's not what I have in mind at all.  Everything that touches
the production process would have to be isolated and audited.  In
practical terms, that would mean bringing the computers in
question in from offsite, with relevant software already installed
and validated.
In the context at hand, watching the whole thing play out would
consist of directing the whole process one step at a time, per a
procedure created in collaboration with the contractor's
engineering and QA departments.  Optical masks and/or equivalent
data files would be handled by client personnel and retained for
validation.  The chips that pop out would be under very stringent
property control, and quite a lot of them would be torn down and
thoroughly analyzed "at home" to validate the run.
Just like doing it at an existing commercial facility, with the
added advantage of much better control of physical access,
hardware, etc. at the dedicated facility. Whether that advantage
would be worth the extra costs, vs. real security improvements,
depends on how reliable the post-production tear down and analysis
of end product components is considered.  "A difference that makes
no difference is no difference."
If it really is impossible to build a trusted CPU with an
untrusted CPU, then it is not possible to build a trusted CPU.
Fortunately, trust is not an absolute and there are ways to build
relatively trustworthy systems from relatively untrustworthy
components.  A quote to the effect of "I do not care who votes, I
only care who counts the votes" comes to mind but I'm too lazy to
look it up right now.
I think that in the engineering and business worlds, trust is
always a point on a cost curve.
When Trust and Security are considered as absolutes, the costs of
maintaining them rise exponentially until the protected assets die
of resource starvation.  Civilization as we know it is presently
following the path of demanding absolute security, provided by
rulers vested with absolute trust, to early termination.  Getting
more on the practical business of making IC chips into the public
domain and widely distributed, enabling faster and decentralized
recovery of today's industrial capabilities, is one of the
benefits of open hardware development projects.
The objectives of an open IC project include providing protections
against institutional sabotage, but also the creation of
protocols, documents and data that can be re-used and improved
over time.  Policies and protocols necessary to assure adequate
transparency, including repeatability, would amount to enlarging
the GPL ecosystem to encompass computer hardware as well as
software.  If such a project can't produce products that are cost
effective for end users, it will remain at most a theme park ride
for misguided investors.  The "high security" angle looks like a
place where potential customers and nearly off-the-shelf
capabilities meet.

To convince router manufacturers that they must transition to
TOR-by-default routers is a tall order:  That's a big commercial
market with a small number of dominant players, inherently aligned
with conservative a.k.a. Fascist interests.
Global many-to-many communications is correctly perceived as a
threat to the political and economic dominance of State and
Corporate institutions, formerly assured by central control of
mass scale communications for censorship and propaganda purposes.
 In this context, mass surveillance is an adaptive response that
seeks to counter-balance the "liberating" impact of the Internet
by enabling early identification and effective manipulation of
emergent mass movements and ad hoc leadership cadres.
TOR is a weapon; the U.S. State Department funds it to support the
destabilizing impact of counter-censorship and
counter-surveillance technology on other, more overtly repressive
regimes.  However, high profile busts of Hidden Service users
indicate that TOR is not quite effective enough to defeat U.S.
network surveillance assets, at least not where fixed high-value
targets are concerned.  This is consistent with U.S. policy
objectives with regard to the strength of all cryptographic
We are told that the TOR Project favors convenience and speed over
security, because this is necessary to build a large enough user
base to make the system effective.  That does not entirely make
sense, as favoring security over speed and convenience would make
the system effective regardless of the size of its user base.  It
makes more sense to imagine that the TOR Project would lose its
Federal funding and become a target for effective harassment and
manipulation by Federal security services, if TOR's security was
upgraded to be resistant to U.S. surveillance capabilities.
"Everybody knows" that effective resistance to traffic analysis of
an encrypted low-latency anonymizing network requires a constant
flow of traffic, padded as necessary with dummy packets to
maintain a constant through-put when an endpoint is idle.  This
deprives observers of the ability to match the endpoints of any
given session by analyzing the timing and number of packets at
entry and exit nodes.
But nobody implements effective cover traffic:  The reasons given
for this deficiency include concerns about bandwidth limitations
and processor overhead. 20 years ago these barriers were real,
today not so much.  I2P users have the option of hosting enough
torrents to keep cover traffic unrelated to their other uses of
that network going; this is not as effective as padding traffic to
maintain a uniform flow, but way better than no cover traffic.
TOR actively discourages file sharing, "because" this would cause
bandwidth and processor overhead problems.
I believe it would be much easier to persuade the TOR Project to
implement cover traffic, or to create a next generation TOR
network that does, than to persuade router makers to support
today's other than best practices TOR network by default.  But I'm
not sure that this can be done by any project based in a U.S.
controlled jurisdiction, as it would be contrary to the National

Ah yup.
Project scopes, code names, and functional descriptions give one a
high level but fairly definitive picture of the systems described.
 Once one knows what they are doing, the how is largely self
explanatory.  The only surprise in the whole Snowden dump is the
scope and depth of U.S. engagement in cyber-spying:  Going from
well founded suspicion to detailed documentary evidence is a
quantum leap, converting knowledge into intelligence.
The extent of Greenwald & Co. cooperation with State authorities,

It may be a coincidence that the first two Big Stories of the
Snowden Saga broke on the same days as the last two major events
in the Manning trial.  Greenwald knocked Chelsea's story right off
the public's radar.  I do believe in coincidences, but I try not

Omidyar also seems a little creepy to me:
One content gap that I find puzzling is the absence of references
in published Snowden docs to what was formerly called Romas/COIN
then Odyssey, a system revealed by the H.B. Gary e-mail dump.

have not been reading everything that comes down the pipe.
Romas/COIN was the name of Uncle Sam's cellular network, smart
phone and social media surveillance and exploitation toolkit from
Hell (see echelon2.org). As a rich source of high quality
collection in regions vital to the National Interest, I am sure
that the NSA taps into this kit's databases and/or work products,
even if it "belongs to" another Service.  Maybe somebody here
recognizes Romas/COIN as somthing appearing under another name in

downloaded anonymously, without employing extraordinary OpSec
procedures that would incidentally render javascript useless for

include any official agency of any of the FVEYE countries, or any

The network itself is the trap, with or without javascript, with

Good ideas in this thread so far.  What I would add is, get the F
away from population centers; they are very hungry machines that
will start to fail in very bad ways whenever any of their major
inputs are substantially reduced for more than a few weeks - even
without panic and martial law factored in.
On moving way out of town:  Sooner is better, because as the
industrial economy crumbles everyone will get the same bright idea
and that land ain't empty.  It's occupied by communities where it
takes time to learn the human landscape and build trust
relationships.  On arrival start working to establish oneself in
an economic role that will continue to pay off in the form of
mutual aid and bartering of labor and commodities, as the value of
Federal Reserve Notes spirals down.
As for cash money, I like silver way more than gold:  People will
kill you much sooner for gold than silver, and the value of silver
has been steadily rising due to industrial applications drawing
down the world supply faster than mining is able to replace it.
Another thing to think about is identifying technology that will
stay relevant to the practical concerns of feeding and housing
people in your local economy when international supply chains go
sideways for months or years at a time.  Learn what is and isn't
important by getting involved in the actual work, and get on top
of how to run and fix that stuff, /then/ stockpile spare parts and
In short, start building the world of 2100 today.  It's going to

In the English language, every meaning of the word "fuck," except
one, references violence or damage.  I'm gonna fuck you up, he
really got fucked over, they fucked us out of it, this fucking
shit sucks.  "Fuck you" is an expression of anger or challenge.
Conversational use of the word "fuck" is commonplace in the
military services and among economically and otherwise repressed
minority populations, but much less so in "polite" society where
all forms of routine violence are kept out of sight or at least
have lace doilies on top of them.
I have long held that the true meaning of "fuck" reflects a
profound social psychosis, normalized through centuries of common
usage and elaborate rationalizations, where sex IS violence.  When
the word "violence" is understood in the context of Anarchist or
Libertarian ideology as "violation" of the personal integrity of
another by force, deception or strategic subterfuge, numerous
everyday examples of sexual assault, sexual repression and sexual
exploitation come to mind.  (Voice over, Eric Idle:  "Now we see
the violence inherent in the system!")
I got no time for "Liberal Feminism" 'cause that word Liberal
denotes a "loyal opposition" to Establishment institutions based
on violence.  Liberals complain politely to their rulers, and are
kind to people they personally know, so it's not their fault if
their path to personal comfort and security is paved with the
bones of murdered children.
The Women's Lib faction of the New Left complained rudely, and set

The word "collectivism" carries a lot of baggage, as it has been
flown as a banner over many authoritarian, violent dictatorships
"of the proletariat."  But the base concept of concern for the
well being of one's community as integral to one's own well being
has also been called compassion, honor and common sense.
Darwinian evolution does not favor the me-first individualist,
however strong, dominant, awesome, etc. that individual may be.
Humans have a genetic predisposition to form families, villages
and tribes, to identify with them and hold the interests of the
group at co-equal to self interest.  Purely self centered motives
are socially pathological, and Darwinian evolution selects against
this trait:  Because the awesome dominance of the "fittest" has
negative long term survival value, compared to those who work at
maintaining a strong, resilient community that provides a
favorable environment for the whole community's progeny out to the
Nth generation.  When the smartest guys in the room tell us
otherwise, they are not mistaken:  They are lying.  The more power
is afforded to purely self-interested socioeconomic "winners," the
more their actions damage the long term viability of the community.
Big problems arise when unnaturally large "communities," i.e.
States exist, because they can not exist without the services of
an elite group of political and economic power brokers who provide
millions (!) of subjects with a convincing illusion of "community"
with people they will never meet in real life.  Deception alone
won't do the job, so armed guards must also be employed to enforce
the orders of these facilitators.  Viola:  Rent-seeking absentee
landlords, serving their own interests at the expense of the
ersatz "communities" they rule.  It's all downhill from there.
"Democracy" so-called, an attempt at community self regulation
among strangers who will never meet, does not scale well.  My
favorite historical example is the response of Iceland and the
United States to the "financial crisis" of 2008.  Iceland,
population 1/3 million, responded as a human community, "regulated
the regulators" and has since jailed corrupt bankers who failed to
flee the country in time.  The United States, population 360+
million, responded as directed by the perpetrators of a massive
fraud, and rewarded them handsomely for their efforts.
Any -ism that is proposed to replace the policies of an existing
large State without eliminating that State, promising Utopian
outcomes, is at best a shockingly ignorant error in judgement.
But it is more likely a deliberate swindle backed by socially
pathological "individuals" and interest groups.  If the -ism
involves a large State with a putative monopoly on violence (as
violation: robbery, kidnapping, murder), it's just one more brand
label and PR campaign for Fascism.
Any -ism that proposes breaking up large States into small,
independent communities governed without delegating decision
making authority to "representatives" is difficult to implement
anywhere the modern State has taken root.  Intellectual types
rarely approve of any such scheme, because it would mean trusting
people to "do the right thing" of their own accord, without
morally and mentally superior guidance from On High.  But I am
confident that people who implement such schemes where and as
possible stand the best chance of producing societies worth living
in.  We are heading into a global industrial and human population
crash that will produce numerous local opportunities to do just that
And that's why I look forward to the End Of The World with
considerable optimism.  By definition the real "collectivists"
will be the long term winners, and I don't think that will be a
Bad Thing.

Collaborative actions based on a sane balance between individual
and community interests are possible, history provides numerous
examples at scales ranging from the family and village to tribe
and nation.  With the exception of defective individuals, human
beings are naturally inclined to form communities, to identify
with those communities, and to work in the common interests of
those communities.  I call the people who lack this natural
inclination "defective" as their actions tend toward negative
impacts on group survival in the long term.
Today we have a really big problem in the form of really big
countries:  Human communities do not scale to that size.  Compare
the "community values" performance of Iceland, population 1/3
million, to the performance of the good ole U.S.A., population
360+ million.
Attempts to scale community values to the size of a large country
always involve creating administrative classes, insular
communities of professionals in commercial and political
governance who facilitate artificial "bonds of community" between
massive numbers of strangers who will never meet.  Viola, rent
seeking absentee landlords who employ armed guards to enforce
their orders.  If communities regulated by these institutions are
small enough, it is possible for the people to regulate their
regulators; but somewhere between 1/3 and 300 million population,
the balance of power shifts disastrously toward the managerial
class, which becomes a ruling class.
Expositions of political theory are supposed to end with a formula
for creating Utopian outcomes, and a call to action.  Sorry, I'm
out of stock on those items and the shop down the street was
busted for selling toxic imitations.  But I do think that those
who occupy themselves with building, maintaining and defending
sane communities, where and as opportunities to do so arise, will

that only the vendor in question can qualify.  The competitive

Indeed they do.  In a context where the test subjects are
self-selected (volunteers) from a population and culture deeply
committed to elaborate, labor intensive submission to authority
(college students), with "the boss" hovering over them demanding
compliance (politely of course), most will continue "only
following orders" to the point of endangering the lives of
anonymous strangers.
I'm not sure this generalizes to describe the behavior of whole
populations in the wild, though.  Certainly, every country of any
size has more than enough pathological "followers" to field
military forces, run concentration camps, etc.  But I think "60%
to 90%" of any population is a very high estimate.
Nope:  I was expressly talking about "Those who comply most
eagerly", not the much larger number whose compliance is marginal,
grudging, or largely pretended.
You'll get no arguments from me on that point:  If I could find a
way to put that on a paying basis, I would probably not be flat
broke today.
Major clue:  The most persistent and effective populist resistance
movements have emerged from religious communities.  Our
adversaries understand this well, and spare no expense promoting
atheism to the demographic groups most likely to engage in
political activism.
Terminally corrupt, easily bought clergy - a minority among that
occupation - are kept front and center in public view by mass
media outlets, for the dual purpose of alienating as many 'natural
born rebels' as possible from religion in general, and recruiting
as many 'natural born killers' as possible into a "God and
Country" eg. God IS Country cult paradigm.
More obvious to the general public:  As an example consider the
unprecedented mass media coverage of violent crimes by police
officers, and social network propaganda campaigns like those run
by Black Lives Matter, Cop Watch, etc.
Likewise, Liberals and Conservatives are acutely aware of mass
scale economic crimes by our rulers:  The Liberals are taught to
blame Capitalism and the Conservatives to blame Socialism.  The
real perpetrators are billionaires who use Capitalist or Socialist
models where and as they provide maximum advantage; as long as the
general public fails to recognize this the game can continue - but
no matter what, the looting of national economies and attendant
reductions in the rewards of obedience continues.
I have not proposed violent excesses, I have observed them.  Big
History:  Satyagraha, Civil Rights, People Power and the Zapatista
movement never happened?  The Dutch did not bring Nazification of
their country to a grinding halt, and Iceland is still controlled
by a gang of criminal bankers?
As rationalizations go, imagining State and Corporate actors to be
all-powerful and civil society weak and helpless, is a GREAT
excuse for personal non-action.  That's why State aligned actors
consistently present these Big Lies as Eternal Truths.
An angry fighter is a losing fighter.  Things that are not "OK"
are in fact explainable, and if your explanations accurately model
the causes of Bad Things, they will enable you to develop
effective strategies for reducing or eliminating those Bad Things.
We have all been taught that Bad Things are done by Bad People,
and that the universal solution is to identify, hate, and destroy
those Bad People.  We are taught this by propagandists employed by
Bad People, so that our responses to the bad things they do will
be self defeating.  The same naive beliefs are essential for
promoting wars of economic conquest, where people must be
persuaded that certain foreign leaders are Bad People who must be
hated and destroyed.
As for removing the promised rewards of full compliance with
illegitimate authority, that is a self-solving problem if one
waits long enough.  Right now in the former Western Democracies,
those rewards are being removed by the ruling class, via wholesale
looting of national economies at the fastest pace that will not
cause them to immediately collapse.
This looting is necessary to sustain the exponential growth of
corporate enterprise, which is necessary to its own survival and
to the financial ambitions of our billionaires:  The exponential
growth of the global industrial economy has reached hard limits
imposed by geophysics; the only way to keep our billionaires'
portfolios growing is redistribution of wealth from the poor and
middle classes to the very rich.
What I mean by "this" requires the context of the paragraph the
sentence above has been removed from:  "This" is the growing gap
between rewards promised and rewards delivered, in return for
committed compliance with the demands of illegitimate authority.

"Kafkatrapping" a.k.a. guilt tripping by advocates of various
social and economic reform agendas is a losing strategy.  Among
naive followers attracted to activist causes, it encourages
contempt and hostility toward audiences they must reach and
influence in order to achieve their movement's goals.  Guilt
tripping may persuade some weak minded outsiders to submissively
fall in line with the movement's agenda, but reliably alienates
opinion leaders and non-aligned activists whose support is
necessary for the movement's growth and success.  Effective
activist leaders focus on building mutually supportive
relationships with their audiences; paid infiltrators, careerists
and volunteer egomaniacs focus on dividing their audiences into
mutually hostile armed camps.
Guilt tripping is elitism.  It makes the ignorant conformist
follower feel superior, at the cost of alienating key audiences
whose support is essential for the movement's success.
The grievances of reform movements are always objections to the
abuse of power by those who have it.  Those who have power want to
keep it, and they are well positioned to employ political warfare
assets including helpful State Security services and the Public
Relations industry.  Their clandestine operators work to degrade
reform movement messaging, divide reform movement supporters, and
turn as much of the general public as possible against reform
movements.  Broadcast media outlets work to assure that the most
divisive messaging from a "movement" reaches the general public
first and loudest.  Consistent, persistent guilt trip messaging
from a reform movement reliably indicates the presence and
influence of actors inside the movement who are opposed to the
movement's stated objectives.
Effective political activists do not use or tolerate guilt
tripping, simply because it is counter productive.  Blanket
personal condemnation of one's fellow humans can and should be
called out whenever seen, on the basis that it is both factually
wrong and strategically "less than useless."

I don't think network surveillance had much to do with it, but in
terms of political warfare 'on the field', I believe I have seen
examples recently.  Example:
When the grand jury verdict clearing the cop who shot Michael
Brown was announced, there was a very large but orderly
demonstration in downtown Ferguson.  We know this because people
who were present posted photos and videos as it happened.
According to realtime reports posted from the scene, crowd was
ordered to disperse then immediately tear gassed.  That wasn't the
"hot story" covered by the press corps, however.
Mass media news outlets reported rioting:  USA Today used the
headline "Ferguson Burning."  But that didn't happen.  The only
"civil disturbance" was the CW attack on the crowd downtown.
The material events referenced by the propaganda narrative were
consistent with one or two mobile teams armed with molotovs and
M-80 firecrackers leading the TV cameras on a merry chase away
from the crowd downtown by simulating gunfire and setting fires:
The isolated fires were not associated with disorderly crowds or
looting. There were numerous reports of gunfire but no injuries or
reports of people seen carrying guns or shooting.  The biggest
fires were at an auto parts store, and a used car dealership where
a row of cars were burned (the owner presumably got the full
insured value of some stock that wasn't moving).  One police car
apparently burned for over an hour, as if prepared in advance to
do so in case it took longer than expected for TV news crews to
In this instance, it is very possible that network surveillance
enabled our Security Services to determine in advance that there
would be a large crowd that night, at a well organized

have predicted the crowd, but its orderly behavior was not a

The power to give and withhold permission for others to see you

'privacy' are just that, historical.  But in the context of the

something that exists naturally and is violated when State actors
pry into the private affairs of individuals.  That's a narrow
viewpoint, distorted by an increasingly irrelevant context.
Today, State actors are only one group of "privacy violators,"

counterbalanced by significant advantages that are inherent in a

Not my field, but I do know that ham radio operators using /very/
directional high gain antennas followed the missions from Earth
orbit to the surface of the Moon, listening to and recording voice

Moon, and maintaining a constant stream of 100% believable signals
all the way there and back, would have been quite staggering.  The
odds of this unlikely mission failing would have approached 100%
over the course of six missions.
Cheaper to build and launch a series of Saturn V launch vehicles
with LEMs and command modules on top, than to just go ahead and
send them all the way?  At minimum it would cost the same as doing
the program for real.
Also consider that part of the price of simulating an Apollo
program would have been the cost of maintaining the illusion from
beginning to end, under the watchful eyes of thousands of
engineers who thoroughly understood the systems they were working
on, documented everything they did in minute detail, and
distributed  that documentation to other equally well informed
engineers working on related systems?  It would have cost much
more to fake the program than to actually do it.
Not to mention the 100% risk of exposure, since /one/ error in the
deception would have resulted in a chain reaction leaving the
whole deception exposed to dozens, then hundreds, then thousands
of very smart, very committed, very pissed off people.  Even the

How is it possible that the Soviet Union did not detect and expose
the moon landing hoaxes (there were six successful Apollo missions

doing them?
How is it possible that /no/ credible evidence that the Apollo
program was a hoax has surfaced by now?  All I have seen is
speculation, elevated to "evidence" in the eyes of some beholders
by confirmation bias.
Example:  No dust on the faceplate in a very famous photo of an
astronaut on the moon.  This widely distributed "proof" of a moon
landing hoax falls flat when placed in its native context:  The
propaganda extravaganza around the Apollo program produced and
published /lots/ of high quality graphics.  Time Magazine used all

and from time to time it seems to have been well received:  It's a
course in remedial politics, intended to fill basic gaps in
people's information about how populist a.k.a. anarchist politics
actually works:
The presumption that people who are notably compliant with
illegitimate  authority have a "conscience" and fixed notions of
right and wrong is questionable.  Those who comply most eagerly
include sociopathic personalities and people who are all to easily
led due to other disorders.
The "60% to 90%" cover a spectrum from grudging, minimal
compliance to elaborate and even competitive compliance, typically
related to the degree that their individual income and social
status benefit from a show of compliance.  But as the gap between
rewards promised and rewards delivered continues to widen, and the
violent excesses of our rulers become more and more obvious,
compliance will continue to decline.  This creates a growth market
for populist political agitators - a market that opponents and
supporters of authoritarian rule are already competing to capture.
Politics is about power:  Who has it, who doesn't, and how these
groups interact.  The object of political activity is to obtain
and exercise power, toward whatever ends one chooses.  Political
models and strategies that actually work in this context are
"correct" while those that do not work are "incorrect."  There is
a time and place for everything, but rarely a time when elitism,
or driving wedges between groups who have political enemies in
common with oneself, is "correct" in a functional sense.

"Everybody lies." - Greg House
First and foremost we lie to ourselves, continuously, as our
central nervous systems build models of the world based on
incomplete data and unexamined assumptions.  We usually believe
the result of this process is the "real world," because it is the
only world we can experience.  We have to believe, because the
processing overhead of questioning and testing everything, all the
time, would be crippling - and the results would be inconclusive.
But there is a limit to the advantage of taking our illusory
impressions of the real world at face value, and sometimes it does
pay to consciously examine how confident we are of a source of
information, why we have that confidence, and how these factors
should affect own conclusions about that information.  What
evidence do we really have, where did it come from and how can it
be tested?
When our available information is second hand, ambiguous and/or
self contradictory, and especially when it originates in a context
of human conflict, there may be no rational basis for confident
conclusions about what really happened:  Just a cluster of
possible interpretations which can be assigned higher or lower
probability on a basis of educated guesswork about the quality of
the sources and how the information itself fits - or does not fit
- - into what we already 'know' about its native context.
People who do this for a living are called intelligence analysts,
and their training includes all of the above.  When the going gets
spooky, the spooks his the books.  Highly recommended for anyone

represents "reality," so it pays to have a handle on how that

In any healthy and productive engineering shop, physical or

forgiven for seeing a "meritocracy" where none exists.  In a
healthy, productive engineering shop, anyone who contributes to
the practical objectives of the project is valued as a team member
and encouraged to continue doing so.  Those who are in a position
to make large and highly visible contributions may thereby become
"popular" but this does not confer authority on them, and is not
an obstacle to anyone else's contributions.
Of course there are dysfunctional engineering shops, commercial

Quite so. "Democracy" was an early casualty of the Industrial
Revolution, which concentrated unprecedented wealth and power in
the hands of industrialists.  In the United States, the issue of
collective rule by land owners vs. collective rule by factory
owners was decided by the Civil War.  Today "democracy" normally
means "deniable subversion and control by a ruling oligarchy."
Not to mention future shock.  Big decisions made today, if they
can not be implemented by next Tuesday, are likely to be
implemented in a world where their relevance is limited at best -
if they can be implemented at all.  The future itself is
recognized as an adversary by those whose interests are best
served by maintaining established power structures.
Wait, what?  I would question the possibility that 'elites' can
make any decisions in the direction of mass liberty.  If an elite
class exists, its collective interest lies in increasing the
liberties available to the elite class, at the expense of everyone
else's liberties.
Ideally the lower classes should have the 'liberty' to choose
options from a menu presented to them by their betters.  This
softens the blow of a policy regime where "everything that is not
mandatory is prohibited."  Should one faction of an elite class
appear to advocate for 'popular liberty,' they are doing so in an
effort to shift market dynamics to favor their own enterprises, at
the expense of other elite factions that will oppose any such
Of course they weighed the issues.  Doing so enables an elite
class to use its power today, to remain an elite class tomorrow.
At the outset of the Internet's exponential growth, America's
captains of corporate industry contracted their strategic advisers
- - think tanks, intelligence services, market researchers,
propaganda shops - to determine what policies and practices would
best serve their interests in the emerging Information Age.
Informed by the openly published analyses and strategic plans of
social and political activists on the early Internet (i.e. the
WELL community's 'electronic democracy' advocates), these advisers
reported that the Internet would destabilize social and political
power structures in unprecedented ways, shifting power away from
the few toward the many - much as the printing press had in an
earlier age, but on a larger scale with more immediate, agile and
adaptive impact.
Proposed solutions included mitigating the worst impacts of the
Internet on established power by making it a surveillance
platform, with unprecedented scope and depth of penetration into
the everyday lives of whole populations.  This would facilitate
faster, more effective tactical, policy and propaganda responses
to the emergence of populist power centers on the network,
partially mitigating the Internet's undesirable impacts.  So,
along with a major shift toward authoritarian governance,
consolidated broadcast propaganda platforms and accelerated
redistribution of wealth (= power) upward in the social hierarchy,
a comprehensive State and corporate surveillance regimen was
facilitated by the "open" and inherently insecure nature of its
protocols and implementations.
Early 'netizens' understood the potential of the Internet as a
force multiplier for populist political actors, and they knew that
established power blocks with a common vested interest in the
status quo would fight back.  They redoubled their efforts to
develop, refine and propagate strategies and tactics for Internet
enabled populist political action.  Technologists sympathetic to
these efforts started developing practical countermeasures to
Internet surveillance and censorship, and the rest is Cypherpunk
The meaning of "security" depends very much on context:  Whose
security, against what hostile actors?  Technologists with an
Anarchist, Libertarian or other populist political orientation
view "insecure" network protocols, software and hardware as
problems to be solved.  Political warfare assets employed by
military, law enforcement and corporate actors would call these
same features strategic and tactical assets, enabling them to
enhance the security of their employers against hostile and/or
destabilizing influences.
Occasionally, anti-security in the network infrastructure will
turn around and bite its authors in the ass - comprehensive
Chinese penetration of U.S. military contractors and the OMB
personnel records fiasco will probably stand as classic examples
for quite a while.  But occasional victories by one's adversaries
is a cost of doing business in any war, including information
warfare against one's own restive and unruly populace.  Lessons
are learned, tactics are adjusted, and the information warriors
move on to the next battle front.
We shall have a "more secure Internet" going forward.  But as long
as we do have a ruling class, we shall not have a "secure
Internet" except at the scale of darknet operations that, as their
name implies, are as secure against wide public participation as
they are against State and corporate surveillance.
I do hope the IETF and IT industries proves me at least partially
wrong, by implementing the objectives outlined in RFC 6973.  But I
believe nothing of this sort can be implemented until or unless
sufficient technical countermeasures to enable State and corporate
actors to proceed with mass surveillance and censorship as usual
are available.
Another security issue overshadows all of the above:  The role of
disinformation operations that attack the network's end users via
weaponized social psychology.  But that's a whole 'nother topic.

Bingo.  How fast do you want web pages to load, vs. how much do
you want it to cost to de-anonymize your traffic?
In the case of TOR, it has long appeared to me that its leading
design objectives include competing on the speed front with
unprotected networking and VPN services.  The benefits of this
competition include a larger user base = larger anonymity set.
The drawbacks include "the government that pays for TOR also has
the capability to defeat TOR."
Last time I checked, the TOR Browser ships with NoScript turned
off by default, leaving it unprotected against a large family of
side channel attacks.  This choice also looks like a convenience
for technologically naive end users, again degrading the core
security mission for the sake of a larger user base.  In this case
we do know that hostile State actors have used the deficiency to
unmask users, via a honey pot attack exploiting javascript to
phone home and report the users' IP addresses.
Leaving fill traffic on the "to do list" forever, pending the
disappearance of vocal advocates who claim that cover traffic is
not practicable - either "impossible!" or due to a perceived
head-to-head performance contest with unprotected networking -
completes the picture of a State sponsored cryptographic tool
breakable by the State that funds it (but nobody else so far).
I personally consider TOR sufficiently decent to positively lock
out routine commercial surveillance of end users.  Sufficiently
decent to provide reliable protection against NSA assets when
combined with physical OpSec, i.e. covertly using open WiFi
routers and single use disposable computers for brief one-off
sessions.  Sufficiently valuable as an NSA collection asset to
discourage routine harassment or prosecution of TOR users for
petty offenses, which would reveal to more "valuable" targets that
TOR does not protect them.
So far we are only talking about passive attacks by an actor who
can observe both ends of most TOR network connections.  More
costly active attacks could defeat /any/ anonymizing network
protocol based on onion or garlic routing protocols.  So whether
or not to "fix" TOR at the cost of alienating the bulk of its user
base due to performance issues might merit some debate.
My preferred solution:  Defund the the agencies that can and
almost certainly do defeat all current network anonymity
protocols.  My program for accomplishing this objective:  Wait.
They are hell bend on self destruction and Nature will provide.

The bizarre propaganda narrative about a locked iPhone that
belonged to a dead criminal suspect just keeps growing.  Now the
Electronic Frontiers Foundation has boarded the disinformation
train, via its latest EFFEctor newsletter and an amicus brief.
EFF to Support Apple in Encryption Battle
I can maybe forgive EFF's casual assertion that Syed Rizwan Farook
was "one of the perpetrators of Decemberâs San Bernardino
shootings" - since they used three names he /must/ be an assassin;
the FBI says he is, what more proof could one ask?
But in the same press release, EFF endorses absurd non sequiturs
that demonstrate painful ignorance of the subject matter at hand.
 The EFF endorses the assertations that the only way to obtain
access to encrypted data stored on an iPhone is to manually key in
a password on the device itself, that removing a software function
that deletes a stored key hash after n. failed decryption attempts
voids the security of the encrypted data stored on that device,
and that doing this to one iPhone would affect the security of all
iPhone users.
Either people without the slightest understanding of how
cryptography works /or/ how computer forensics works are calling
the shots at EFF, or someone there has deliberately stood up
strawmen for the FBI'a attorneys to knock down, or... damn if I know

I have designed and implemented ISO 9001 quality programs for
engineering firms.  The paychecks were real, the external audits
were real, the reliability of deliverables was real.
In the real world, the QA game is about compromises:  No company
is ever fully compliant; success is measured in "failure to fail"
in the real world, despite documented and undocumented variances
in QA compliance.  And of course, the ability to pass external audit
So, since when does the ability of the QA department to verify
that stuff does not crash (often) on well formed input, mean that
the QA department is qualified to reverse engineer and "break"
cryptographic protocols on demand?  That was the origin of this
whole discussion, with me on the "not QA's job" side.

The division of labor relevant to QA breaks down like this:
Design work is a collaboration between sales/marketing,
engineering staff and (where applicable) customer representatives.
 QA participates by documenting the process and assuring that
relevant facts are clearly communicated between these parties.  QA
does not need to understand the technical details, rather it needs
to assure that people who do understand these details agree that
they are correct per an evidence based process.
Validation work is a collaboration between engineering staff, QA
and customer representatives where applicable, with the sole
objective of assuring that prototypes and first articles of a
product performs as intended.  Again, QA does not need to
understand how the product works, only what it is supposed to do
and whether or not it does that, per the report of other
participants in the process.
Inspection/verification work is a collaboration between
engineering, production and QA staff, with the sole purpose of
assuring that components and systems do not deviate from those
that passed the validation process and were approved for production.
QA is about process:  Communication, documentation, and
facilitating timely and effective remedial action when problems
arise.  QA personnel do not "do" any part of the engineering
process; their whole mission is to facilitate reliable and
effective work by others.

The QA department is not responsible to understand how the code
(or gadget) works, they are responsible to verify that it does
work, and that the "thing that worked" is the thing that ships in
the product it goes with.
Conversely, whoever designed and implemented the cryptographic
system baked into the Apple hardware in question had /better/ be
aware of how to attack it:  Otherwise, a 3rd party's job when
attempting to break the system is likely to be way too easy.
The same people who made it /do/ need to be able to inspect their
own work, especially during the initial development and
implementation process, and the tools to do so will be familiar to
them.  That makes them just the right folks to ask for advice and
assistance when it's time to develop a process for unwrapping the
package they made.
The ability to monitor the supply chain inbound to the machinist,
measure the parts the machinist makes and track them to their
final destination in a larger assembly external customer, does not
imply the ability to prescribe a specific manufacturing process,
make the part in question, or to evaluate its fitness for use for
a particular purpose.  Those latter functions, and creation of
specifications as acceptance criteria, are jobs for design and
production engineers.
Dozens who want to hire them, worldwide; hundreds who will never
hire them, in their local job market.  Generally speaking,
business owners, executives and managers regard "whistleblowers"
and "refusniks" as proven troublemakers.
A Judge can order just about anyone to do just about anything,
subject only to the approval of other Judges up the chain of
command /if/ their legal authority to issue the order is challenged.
Advantage:  The State.

Insubordination is always grounds for dismissal, unless an
employee is ordered to break the law or expose him or herself to
legally banned workplace hazards.  So Apple could handle
non-cooperation problems without involving the Feds:  If we was
Apple, would we want to piss off a client so big that it is a
lucrative market all its own, just to indulge some ungrateful
non-team-player's personal snit fit?  What would Apple board
member Ronald D. Sugar, former chairman and CEO of Northrop
Grumman, say about that?
If Apple receives a Court order or lands a contract that requires
re-purposing staff, they can just hire any skill sets they don't
already have on hand.  If special NDAs or even Federal security
clearances are required, no problem:  If it's a contract matter,
the additional costs are included in the bid; if it's a Court
order, Apple can ask for and most likely receive "reasonable"
compensation for following lawful orders.
"Self destruct?"  It is to laugh.  "Can't work around it?"
These propositions only work if we assume Apple does not have an
in-house capability to analyze, troubleshoot and re-program its
own hardware, does not have the technical capability to read from
the storage media in its own devices, and lacks the engineering
staff and/or data necessary to alter Apple brand software.  In the
case of any such deficiencies, Apple (or the FBI) can hire any
required reverse-engineering done, under NDA (or gag order).
If Apple did not already do whatever was asked of them with regard
to one iPhone formerly owned by one criminal suspect, the FBI can
bring in the NSA on the basis of mere "suspicion" that the case
may have a link to non-U.S. persons.
Instead we get a legal dispute and minor media sideshow based on a
pile of false assertions by /both/ parties, apparently in
collusion, with the apparent intent of creating a legal precedent
for mandatory back doors in U.S. personal electronics - and/or
public demand for legislation to that effect.

"The CIA Campaign To Steal Apple's Secrets"
By Jeremy Scahill and Josh Begley, published in The Intercept:
"These machines have two separate keys integrated into the silicon
of their Apple-designed processors at the point of manufacture.
The two, paired together, are used to encrypt data and software
stored on iPhones and iPads. One, the User ID, is unique to an
individualâs phone, and is not retained by Apple. That key is
vital to protecting an individualâs data and â particularly on
Appleâs latest devices â difficult to steal. A second key, the
Group ID, is known to Apple and is the same across multiple Apple
devices that use the same processor. The GID is used to encrypt
essential system software that runs on Appleâs mobile devices."

This article's title foreshadows its content:  Many complex words

Orwell's 'duckspeak' condenses language into short bursts of
stereotyped, reflexive utterances, meaningless outside the context
of simplistic, indoctrinated verities supplied by the State.  The

prose, the author piles high level abstractions one atop the other
until any possible meaning disappears, in an apparent attempt to
impress and confuse the reader.  I had to re-read several
paragraphs in the article to unravel their structure and assign
possible meanings to them.  On the whole it looks to me like a
verbal Rorschach inkblot; devoid of content, but the reader might
see his or her own latent beliefs peeking out here and there to
create an illusion of deeper meaning.

mainstream Western media actively distorts, obscures, or flat out

Hash: SHA1
An independent audit found a substantial deficiency in one of the
dependencies of the SecureDrop document submission / management
protocol.  SecureDrop gave the devs time to fix it before
publishing, but so far the issue remains unresolved:
Publishing the unredacted SecureDrop 0.3.4 audit report
vs. SecureDrop uses OSSEC, a popular open source host-based intrusion
detection system (HIDS). The OSSEC architecture consists of a
single central server, called the Manager, which monitors one or
more systems. The monitored systems have programs called Agents,
which collect a variety of information and forward it to the
Manager for analysis and correlation.
The Manager and the Agents may communicate with one of two
protocols: "syslog" or "secure". The "secure" protocol is a custom
crypto protocol based on shared secret keys that are set up during
OSSEC deployment. NCC Group reviewed the custom protocol and found
two serious issues in its cryptographic design:
    Protocol messages are encrypted with the shared secret key
using Blowfish in CBC mode. Unfortunately, the protocol uses a
static initialization vector (IV) to encrypt and decrypt all
messages. This essentially reduces CBC mode to ECB mode and fails
to achieve semantic security.
    Protocol messages are not authenticated. Each message includes
an MD5 hash of the plaintext payload with the encrypted content,
but this is not a strong authenticator. Among other things, it
violates Moxie Marlinspike's "Cryptographic Doom Principle".
For more detail, see the finding in the unredacted audit report.
NCC Group did not take the time to investigate a proof of concept
(PoC) attack based on this vulnerability, but that is not
surprising given the limited duration of their engagement and the
fact that their focus was on SecureDrop, not OSSEC. Nonetheless,
these are serious cryptographic design flaws that could lead to a
practical attack in the future. We encourage all OSSEC users to
examine their current deployments, consider the level of exposure
of any OSSEC "secure" protocol traffic to potential adversaries,
and make changes accordingly.

My take, just for the hell of it:
1)  At least the best known early vaccines, and today's flu
vaccines, are placebos.
This is based on British public health statistics, consistently
showing mortality attributed to contagious diseases in radical
collapse before the introduction of vaccines against same, with no
noticeable acceleration in that collapse after the introduction of
the vaccines.  Long story short:  The entire impact of sanitary
sewer systems, safer water supplies, public health policy, public
health education and improved medical treatments for contagious
illness have been attributed to vaccines.
The studies most often cited in support of the effectiveness of
flu vaccines share a methodological error which, when corrected,
eliminates the appearance that flu vaccines have any effect,
either way, on mortality stats.  Long article, well worth reading:
- -matter/307723/
or 2)  Vaccines probably do not "cause" autism.  The illusion that
they do would be present either way, as Autistim Spectrum
disorders normally become apparent as developmental delays and
atypical behaviors at about the same age children are given their
first multiple doses of vaccines.  I do think it is very likely
that vaccination triggers earlier appearance of these symptoms due
to the systemic stress of immune system overload, toxic
preservatives, etc. produced by the vaccines.
There are so many possible chemical drivers of subtle, complex,
not-understood neurological disorders like autism that singling
out one cause for an "epidemic" would require detailed studies of
comparable populations who, for instance, do and do not eat
manufactured foodlike product (anything not accurately labelled
"organic"), do and do not live in households that use novel
biochemicals daily (soaps and detergents with synthetic
components, anything "scented", etc.), do and do not live in
regions subject to major environmental toxicity, etc.  Lots of
luck getting that funded.
In summary:
Immunology is the science that tells us how vaccines should work.
 It is a very complex technical discipline, looking at massively
complex organic processes.  Any long term, motivated effort by
immunologists to produce arguments for or against the
effectiveness of vaccines should produce the desired "proofs."
Funding is only available for studies that /assume/ vaccines work.
Epidemiology is the science that can tell us whether or not
vaccines work.  It is a fairly simple and straightforward
discipline, easily understandable by any literate person who makes
the effort, and it tells us that vaccines do not work.
A possible exception:  Veterinary vaccines might actually work.
If so, only because in the process of developing them, massively
iterated "terminal experiments" are possible.  Not so with humans,
alas; all one has to go on there is "according to our PharmaChem
funded research, this /should/ work," and "hey, at least it does
not appear to kill people outright, so where's the harm?"
Personally, I don't use them.

National Security and Double Government, Michael J. Glennon,

presidency to a bifurcated  system â a structure of double
government â in which even the President now exercises little
substantive control over the overall direction of U.S. national
security policy. Whereas Britainâs dual institutions evolved
towards a concealed republic, Americaâs have evolved in the
opposite direction, toward  greater centralization, less
accountability, and emergent autocracy."

The SanBerdino* iPhone Massacre:  A Post Mortem
In a case involving "terrorism" and any "Middle Eastern person,"
the FBI has unlawful legal authority to hand a locked iPhone
containing material evidence to the NSA for cracking.  NSA hands
the phone back, locked up with timestamps undisturbed, along with
a pen drive holding the decrypted content of the device.  All of
this is done under "Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmentalized
Information" cover, as befits the work of a Double Nought Spy
service with a license to do whatever the fuck they want "to
protect and preserve America's Freedom."
Apple got a great publicity boost, Uncle got a shot at legalizing
all of the above and more, and that's the whole story of the big
public controversy.  As for the super-duper security sideshow
about how Apple uses unique hard coded keys to encrypt iPhone
contents, OK fine:  It's actually a decent system, and having the
details out there will result in a bump in sales to "security
conscious" consumers including Apple's /large/ consumer base in
the Federal sector.
Anybody who doubts that the NSA can routinely crack iPhone
encryption - when they have the physical device in hand - haven't
thought it through:  The problem is to read one number stored on
an IC chip.  We have the technology to do that, and the NSA has
the budget, facilities, mandate, and as many practice iPhones as
Apple will sell them.  They also have the resources to "borrow"
any technical documents they need from Apple, with or without
asking permission or telling Apple it happened.  iPhones are
common and reading out the contents of "locked" devices is one of
the reasons why the U.S. has a big budget technical intelligence
service.  It is more than safe to assume that reading out a locked
iPhone is a solved problem at NSA, a documented routine procedure.
 Processing the paperwork for an FBI request based on the word
"terrorism" probably took longer than cracking the iPhone.
The pretended "inability" of the FBI to obtain the contents of a
"Terrorist iPhone" was Security Theater, pure and simple.
Checking out the details of the narrative was necessary to
accurately assess the SanBerdino iPhone Massacre as Security
Theater, but that does not mean it was ever anything but that:  A

The "black box" in recently made motor vehicles is the Electronic

servos throughout the engine, and stores diagnostic error messages
about same.  Today's version of a "racing cam" is a custom chip
installed in the ECM.  A modern automotive engine can not run with its
ECM disconnected.
The ECM also accepts inputs from the driver's controls, runs the
anti-lock braking servos, and controls dashboard readouts.  Some can

In recent vehicles equipped with GPS, the receiver should normally be
integral to the ECM, as is the radio that makes push updates to ECM
software and/or hostile remote control of the vehicle possible.
Factory supported LoJack style security systems and RF door keys would
also be integral to the ECM.
Details will vary, but ECMs made by one manufacturer for all of its
vehicles are usually very similar to one another.  Maintenance manuals
relevant to the make, model and year of the vehicle in question will
"tell all" - or at least, tell enough - if you can access the right ones
Most paranoid motor vehicle end users (I almost said "owners," silly

were silenced.  Once the physical components of those radios have been
identified, "let me count the ways" to disable them without killing

Seems a simple question: The more data you are hiding, and the more

I think "code book" steganography, where pre-determined messages from
a list of messages known only to the sender and receiver are
transmitted via fully visible message timing, content, etc. is very
likely to work until or unless a copy of the code book falls into
hostile hands.
Example: "Any forum post from me, transmitted during an even numbered
hour, is an emergency distress call. Any forum post from you
transmitted during an even numbered hour means "help is on the way,"
odd numbered hour means "sorry, you're on your own."
Hiding arbitrary data inside media files by flipping bits is likely to

I wasn't able to find much detail on that case (in just a couple of
minutes), but it appears that the crew in question were reportedly
using a "custom" stego application to hide documents in photos.
Steganalysis tools that look for statistical and other anomalies in
photos (or audio, etc.) have been under development since ever, and
seem to work very well; presumably NSA et al have way better ones than
we do.  This suggests that the only way to make steganograhy work
against State actors is to "act normal" and hope for the best, i.e.
that your message traffic will not be inspected.  This may sound like
it would work, given the terabytes per millisecond of potential
carrier files crossing the networks - way more than can be stored and
analyzed fast enough for full coverage.
Only one little problem:  Everyone who has traveled to any "hostile
jurisdiction" and everyone who has ever used the word "steganography"
in a cleartext message, visited websites on the topic, participated in
any kind of online discussion about cryptography, etc. is a small
enough set that a large part of /their/ message traffic could be
routinely inspected for hidden content by State level actors.  So that
leaves most spies and all of /us/ out in the cold.
Not sure how Truecrypt volumes constitute steganography. Padded
ciphertext is still ciphertext, plain as day.
If state-level actors are /caught/ using these methods against the
NSA, that would tend to demonstrate that the methods in question do
not work against State actors.
Hiding files inside of files seems to be a bust, but that's not the
only vector for steganography.  Manipulating the timing of signal
traffic, the timing of "real" environmental noise in audio recordings,
the presence/absence/number/postion of certain objects in normal
photographs, the presence/location of specific words in text files
etc. could convey covert messages with little or no risk of detection
through automated analysis - but could not hide kilo- or megabytes of
information per carrier file.
Any practical stego detection protocol should include native analysis
of images embedded in PDF files, with no additional computational
overhead vs. analyzing plain old image files.  In the case of
analyzing the content of seized computer, the presence of stego tools
should assure full steganalysis of all relevant files - and stored
message traffic to and from the user.
Me neither, but I used to be very interested in stenography.  Reading
up on the subject led me to the conclusion that it should work /great/
against adversaries who "suspect nothing" and/or don't know that
stenography exists.  Other adversaries, not so much - unless, as noted
above, one is using a system more akin to a code than a cipher, which
hides a /few/ bits of information in plain sight via the presence,
absence or position of "normal" content in text or media files.

Anonymized routing protocols are designed to defeat passive
observation and limited traffic manipulation by hostile actors.  But
what if an effectively unlimited number of compromised routers,
subject to realtime observation and internal manipulation, were
available to hostile actors?  Game over, I think.
About 15 years ago I used online traceroute utilities and whois
lookups to determine (roughly) where all the high performing Mixmaster
remailers were physically located.  Over half of them, including most
with "exotic sounding" TLDs, were apparently in the state of Texas.
Then I used my data to construct "hard to compromise" chains, routing
Mixmaster messages through national jurisdictions not likely to have
comprehensive data sharing between their security services, and
started sending test messages.  None of these test messages ever made
it back to me.
So I concluded that, despite its major technical superiority to other
anonymized networking protocols, the Mixmaster network was most likely
compromised by passive observation (one owner for a majority of
reliable remailers) and active intervention (traffic between
uncontrolled remailers interrupted in transit).
Owning enough of the routers in an anonymizing network to negate its
security is largely a question of money:  How much budget to you have,
how certain do you want to be that nobody is really anonymous?
If I had to neutralize an anonymous routing network, my approach would
be to set up a cloud server running thousands of instances of the
router software in question, customized to facilitate monitoring by a
hypervisor.  Each of these routers would be connected via VPN to a
unique remote host, which would function as a transparent proxy.  The
proxy hosts could be machines owned by "friendly" actors, rooted
consumer grade routers, purpose built appliances, conventional Windows
botnets or some combination of these.
I have not seen this method of attack described and named; I call it a
"hydra" attack, because one body, many heads.  I think this mode of
attack deserves competent attention (i.e., not by me) because realtime
observation and manipulation of any desired quantity of routers would
provide solutions to any distributed anonymous routing protocol.
The only defence I can think of is to assure that message traffic
passes back and forth between mutually hostile national jurisdictions
before delivery.  This would be a bit of a hairball to implement, lots

It seems to me that high capacity routers would take a performance hit
from the number crunching and caching requirements of semi-anonymizing
all network traffic.  A proposal to redo the whole Internet in some
such protocol would be hard to sell.  People who "want" some measure
of privacy are willing to make cost and performance trade-offs
proportional to their motivation; but bulk data carriers and large
hosting providers are more interested in shaving fractional pennies
off data transactions than in end user privacy.
How much of the network can an adversary see, vs. how big a
performance hit do you need to take to reduce your profile?  Dummy
traffic makes matching the ends of a hidden path orders of magnitude
harder, so the numbers crunched and bandwidth consumed might be an
overall performance tradeoff win.

Since nobody asked, here's a description of why neither TOR nor any
other existing or presently planned anonymizing protocol I know of can
be relied on to conceal a user's identity from the Five Eyes or any of
several other hostile actors.  I surface this concept every year or
so, but so far nobody seems interested in discussing it.  Maybe it's
just too discouraging to think about.  No matter who created it or
why, TOR and similar mix networks are at best security theater,
relative to top tier State adversaries.
Quoting myself from an earlier post:
Anonymized routing protocols are designed to defeat passive
observation and limited traffic manipulation by hostile actors.  But
what if an effectively unlimited number of compromised routers,
subject to realtime observation and internal manipulation, were
available to hostile actors?  Game over, I think.
About 15 years ago I used online traceroute utilities and whois
lookups to determine (roughly) where all the high performing Mixmaster
remailers were physically located.  Over half of them, including most
with "exotic sounding" TLDs, were apparently in the state of Texas.
Then I used my data to construct "hard to compromise" chains, routing
Mixmaster messages through national jurisdictions not likely to have
comprehensive data sharing between their security services, and
started sending test messages.  None of these test messages ever made
it back to me.
So I concluded that, despite its major technical superiority to other
anonymized networking protocols, the Mixmaster network was most likely
compromised by passive observation (one owner for a majority of
reliable remailers) and active intervention (traffic between
uncontrolled remailers interrupted in transit).
Owning enough of the routers in an anonymizing network to negate its
security is largely a question of money:  How much budget to you have,
how certain do you want to be that nobody is really anonymous?
If I had to neutralize an anonymous routing network, my approach would
be to set up a cloud server running thousands of instances of the
router software in question, customized to facilitate monitoring by a
hypervisor.  Each of these routers would be connected via VPN to a
unique remote host, which would function as a transparent proxy.  The
proxy hosts could be machines owned by "friendly" actors, rooted
consumer grade routers, purpose built appliances, conventional Windows
botnets or some combination of these.
I have not seen this method of attack described and named; I call it a
"hydra" attack, because one body, many heads.  I think this mode of
attack deserves competent attention (i.e., not by me) because realtime
observation and manipulation of any desired quantity of routers would
provide solutions to any distributed anonymous routing protocol.
The only defense I can think of is to assure that message traffic
passes back and forth between mutually hostile national jurisdictions
before delivery.  This would be a bit of a hairball to implement, lots
of slippery variables and potential counter-actions by hostiles would
have to be taken into account.  But this approach could increase the
cost and reduce the reliability of Hydra attacks against anonymizing
protocols.  Somewhat.  Probably not enough for "life safety" application
Long story short:  If you want to be /really/ anonymous in the
presence of hostile State sponsored actors, do not rely on a
software-only approach:  Use physical security measures to conceal
your identity from the physical router that connects you to the
Internet, because most or all of the anonymizing routers your traffic

views are dead wrong.  Whether TOR is harmful or helpful depends
entirely on how well its users understand both what it does, and what
their potential adversaries can do about it.
Since the Five Eyes & aligned regimes can easily afford to literally
own and monitor a majority of nodes in any distributed anonymous
routing network (ask me about the Hydra protocol), neither TOR nor any
other planned or proposed anonymizing network provides more than fig
leaf security against that particular cluster of adversaries.  The
same goes for BRICS aligned adversaries.  But even against this
category of attack, TOR may be a useful component in a physical
security protocol for hit-and-run network access.  Against less
capable surveillance actors, TOR is "good enough" unless the operating
system it runs on has itself been compromised.
The largest proven security hazard with TOR is that end users will
disclose their identity in the content of cleartext at an exit node,
either literally or by engaging in stereotyped behavior matching a
profile developed from open public sources, i.e. textual analysis
attacks.  No "airtight" security protocol has ever survived contact

The big error I see is your apparent belief that TOR should be able to
do impossible things, and interpreting its failure to do so as
evidence of malicious intent by its sponsors and developers.
Overly enthusiastic fans of tools like TOR promise "airtight
security," because they believe that airtight security is possible.
Overly enthusiastic critics of TOR and similar tools demand the same
impossible performance, and consider anything less to be a betrayal of
public trust.
One of the most effective ways to defeat a grass roots political
adversary is to build and unleash opposing camps of True Believers to
fight for and against a simplistic, misrepresented version of whatever
the "unwelcome" advocates are trying to accomplish.  What makes this

many instances; guiding them to do it harder, faster and better is no
challenge at all if one has a budget for that.
I don't imagine that every outspoken critic of my little ideas is a

has a right to petition the Universe for redress of grievances against

to an improved understanding of those laws.

Something like that did cross my mind, and I'm glad you expanded on
the theme.  Here we see the difference between a "protocol" as defined
in software, and a "protocol" for face to face human interaction.  In
theory, the approach outlined above would make a network like TOR
orders of magnitude more effective.
But a problem remains:  Software based solutions are easy to deploy,
"just do it."  End users who know something happened (likely a small
minority, unless the changes degrade service) can keep using, drop
out, or fork the project.  Meatspace based solutions are hard:  They
require the informed participation of /numerous/ geographically
dispersed participants.  Compare the case of the PGP web of trust:  It
only works if a critical mass of well informed, proactive end users
make it work.
Getting enough TOR users to do real work in the real world to register
themselves as TOR users sounds like a non-starter to me.

Routing TOR traffic back and forth across mutually hostile borders
would indeed be easy to do.  It only requires, as Dr. Strangelove
would say, The WILL to do so!
However, this would lead to...
The State Department funds TOR to defeat national firewalls of
"repressive regimes", enabling communication favorable to the U.S.
National Interest. TOR is a two edged sword that can also be used
against the National Interest, so the NSA thinks TOR stinks.  But
apparently State, CIA etc. will not give TOR up, because of its role
in the development and management of dissident groups in countries
slated for destruction.
A really big bump in TOR traffic crossing the borders of "repressive
regimes" could create traffic jams that degrade TOR's performance
right where the State Department wants TOR to work best, and escalate
the arms race between TOR and the operators of national firewall
filters.  This would shift the cost/benefit ratio for TOR's sponsors
in the wrong direction.  Hence "hairball."
One possible solution would be to build privacy directly into Internet
protocols.  That could drive the costs associated with network
surveillance way up compared to today's rates, while making TOR and
etc. redundant.
Of course, every State and Corporate stakeholder will unite against
implementing any such scheme, even if practicable solutions are found.
 But someday, somewhere a window of opportunity might open up, and

Plus one on that.  Let me get out my Norton II hat & soap box for a
minute here.
Anarchism provides a frame of reference that enables us to understand
how systems of government actually work, and what we can do with and
to them in purely practical terms. Anarchism does not propose a
Utopian system of government to replace the ones already in place, nor
is it a call to "smash the State" and replace it with nothing.
Anarchism describes a group of people who work together for mutual
advantage as a syndicate.  Syndicates organize themselves to develop and
exploit resources for social and economic gain, often in competition
against rival syndicates and among their own membership.
In a stable going concern State, law and public policy are whatever
its dominant syndicates impose by force on the rest of the people in
the territory they control through the State.  In this context force
means applied power, not just physical violence:  Propaganda,
elaborate deceptions and economic incentives do all the heavy lifting.
 Competent State authorities only apply kidnapping and murder when
other methods of manipulation fail:  Violence "is wrong" in the sense
that, except in the context of terrorism (using the threat of violence
to enforce compliant behavior), violence destroys valuable resources
that "should" properly belong to the dominant syndicates.
Anarchists study politics as social power:  Who has it, who does not,
and how these groups interact.  As such, Anarchism provides a frame of
reference for analyzing and comparing various "systems of government"
and for modifying these systems where and as useful opportunities to
do so arise.  A State sanctioned discipline called Human Ecology seeks
to exploit anarchist theory for the exclusive benefit of dominant
Anarchy becomes a visible "force" when and as enough previously
unorganized people push back against State sanctioned syndicates to
forcibly modify those syndicates' behavior.  When dominant syndicates
controlling a State lose touch with reality and exceed the bounds of
their real social power, they may do enough physical and economic harm
to motivate active rebellion among formerly docile State subjects.  At
these times, Anarchists provide propaganda, educational resources, and
facilitation to enable formerly unorganized people to form effective
ad hoc syndicates of their own, and exercise the specific forms of
social and economic power accessible to them.
In the context of political warfare, Anarchism functions as a force
mltiplier:  By themselves, anarchists do not have the material
resource base needed to affect significant changes in the behavior of
State sanctioned syndicates.  But where and as substantial numbers of
disenfranchised people begin to demand social and economic power of
their own, anarchists can facilitate the rapid development of
effective organization, realistic goal setting, and effective action
by those motivated people.  Some call this process Direct Democracy.
As a countermeasure to the potential impact of Anarchist theory and
practice on the behavior of populations dominated by powerful minority
syndicates, State sanctioned propagandists present a fictional version
of Anarchism based on nihilism.  States spare no expense in promoting
and reinforcing a false definition of Anarchy as "violent opposition
to social order of any kind."  Naive self identifying anarchists who
rebel as they are told by State sponsored propagandists provide
"living proof" that the State's definition of Anarchy is correct.  The
well promoted presence of these pseudo-anarchists on mass
communication networks diverts and obstructs public access to
Anarchist resources - except where and as "real" anarchists
effectively weaponize their own understanding of propaganda and
information warfare techniques.
Well that's enough about that for now.

Over the years three people have told me the same curious story about
how their dog died:  Old and sick, about ready to go, the dog went out
and disappeared:  To be found later, having dug a fairly deep hole in
the ground some distance away from the house, backed into it, and died
there.  None of these animals was "in the habit" of digging holes and
camping there.
An animal that is about to die will not reproduce.  That beast has
already been dealt out of the game.  Yet somehow, the domesticated
canine has acquired a genetic program for a solitary funeral rite:  A
practical one, that inhibits the spread of disease and minimizes
attraction of scavengers etc. to the site.  How is that possible?
The all-conquering Dominant Individual may or may not contribute to
the survival of a community that includes his or her own offspring.
But the individual whose behavior actually does contribute to the
survival of that community increases the odds of his or her
descendants out-competing those of other local communities.  Add
massively iterated trial and error and viola:  Whatever neurophysical
mechanism inspires a dying dog to do that unlikely ritual became a
factory stock feature in the canine world.
The recently popular book Sex At Dawn includes a fatal critique of
"what we think we know" about those horrible killer apes whose example
supposedly explains and excuses human ultra-violence.  Among other
examples, it turns out that foraging apes, when presented with a
single super high value food source daily by anthropologists who want
to study them, do begin to fight over control of that pile of fruit.
The most dominant individuals "would rather let it rot" than allow
others to share it:  A massively iterated genetic trial and error
process prepared them to defend high value food items "as if" there
was only enough for one or two individuals - because that is usually
true of "rare goodies" found while foraging.  But meanwhile, when
observed foraging in the wild, members of the same species tend to
announce their finds to attract others to areas where more goodies are
likely to be found, by bragging on the way cool find /they/ own.
Among Homo Saps, the massive advantages of language and technology
have given a free ride to individuals who get top marks in
intelligence, strength and psychopathy.  They organize for mutual
advantage and spread their contra-survival social traits through the
population like a wildfire.  Thanks to abstract language, the capacity
to lie gives them a powerful arsenal of behavioral manipulation
techniques and they will seize on any opportunity to rationalize and
glorify their violent behavior.  Their cult of the "rugged individual"
and deification of those who accumulate the most wealth and power at
the expense of the community has yet to be bred out of the human
species by massively iterated trial and error.

I think that's a matter of perspective.  Some of "poorest of the poor"
have seen rising incomes, while the "middle class" in many
industrialized jurisdictions has been taking a beating.  But the
billionaires, "statistically insignificant" in terms of head count,
continue to dominate political activity due to the massive extent of
income and assets inequality that appears at the very top of the scale.
A couple of graphs based on U.S. statistics:
  (a real classic)
- - or -
  (less extreme-looking aggregate numbers)
This raises the issue of implementation.  In the case at hand,
counter-anonymity is a question of money:  How much money do you have,
how badly do you want to prevent anonymous transactions?  Remailers,
onion and garlic routing, etc. are at present only somewhat resistant
to an adversary who can observe much of the network, most of the time.
 I envision a briefing where a select group of U.S. billionaires and
telco CEOs learn about AP and are told, "We must spend x trillion
dollars over the next decade to keep this from happening."  Rinse and
repeat in other national and corporate jurisdictions.  Ouch.
I believe that this advantage should be sufficient, given prevailing
conditions as illustrated by the L-Curve graph mentioned above, and
the imperfect nature of anonymity technologies available or envisioned
today.  The absurd spike at the top of the income scale gives a
handful of individuals enormously disproportionate power, and they aim
to keep it.
I think that should be preceded with, "If successful."  Funding a
global, directly democratic freelance mercenary force targeting
"abusers of" power would not produce a post-AP world overnight.
Exhausting the defensive and counter-offensive resources of today's
ruling class would take time.  Assuring that assets pass intact from
deceased owners to their heirs and assignees is already a core
function of the State, so killing individual billionaires might
introduce turbulence but would not remove the problem of "minority
rule by violent means."  I think it would be likely to lead to wide
scale ultra-violent responses.
I have my doubts.  The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.  This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.  Conversely, public demand
for removing an unpopular President would also be proportionally
higher - a mitigating factor.  Conversely x2, that President's backers
might consider certain journalists worth paying over-market prices to
remove, as her efforts might eventually aim the AP process at them
It seems to me that replacing an unjust and inequitable system of
governance enforced by the threat of murder, with a more just and fair
system of governance enforced by murder would not produce results that
most would consider ethical.  Not to say that, if successfully
implemented as envisioned, it would necessarily be worse than what we
have today.
A "Court" is a forum governed by a sovereign authority, where
petitions and arguments are heard and decisions on the application of
sovereign authority are made.  A Court whose sole function is to
authorize murder could dispense revenge, but never justice:  Every
sovereign in every war throughout history has presented its casus
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble.
Ever since the appearance of hierarchical societies with capital
assets to defend, assassination markets of a sort, e.g. military and
police activities, have been the bedrock of political and economic
systems.  The anonymity element has traditionally been partial and
figurative - decisions to commit State sanctioned murder are "nothing
personal" in the sense that they are supported by consensus across
committees and syndicates, automated to the fullest extent possible
(law, policy, due process), and paid for by small payments from large
numbers of peasants who have been persuaded to tolerate murder for
hire "for the greater good."  Those who do the actual killing are
absolved of liability because they are "faceless cogs in the machne"
only following orders.  The AP model radically streamlines and
democratizes, but does not remove, today's process of controlling
people via murder "for the greater good of the greater number."
If the practical barriers to its implementation could be overcome, AP
might be an improvement over present methods.  Revenge is not justice,
but unlike justice it can at least be played as a formal game.  AP
markets would eventually provide great entertainment, in the form of
assassin vs. assassin contests triggered by contentious "hits."
Crowdfunding contract killers to identify and kill other contract
killers could evolve into a full replacement for today's professional
athletic amusements.
The seeds were everywhere.  Lots of twistid visionaries saw
assassination markets coming, though none worked out the details to
make it (nearly) practicable - that was waiting on applicable
- From Subvert Comix  by Spain Rodriguez, 1976:
But again, the devil is in the details:  Thus far it looks to me like
the twin problems of anonymity that is not reliably anonymous, and the
vast scale of financial resources presently controlled by the segments
of the population who are AP's likeliest targets, are outstanding
problems complicating AP's implementation.
Back in 1984 I was interviewed by a non-human intelligence, who
briefly explained why it was self evidently necessary to remove 90% of
the Earth's human population and asked for authorization to proceed.
I could not fault his case, but I did impose a condition on my
acceptance of his offer:  Proceed only if everyone faces an equal
chance of removal - no favoritism or exemptions of any kind allowed.
Apparently a compliant solution is taking quite a long time to
implement.  But as and when it is, many of the problems AP would
combat would be greatly reduced, as would the practical barriers to
AP's implementation.
Although a "better future" was not promised or even implied, I am
cautiously optimistic...

If that is the case with Our Mr. Applebaum, it would inevitably result
in at least /some/ hurt feelings, even if he was a perfect fucking

It is possible that he is a victim of spontaneous combustion comparable

better than the criminal model.
It is highly probable that IF a political warfare activity was asked to

reasonable price and deliver the goods on time.  The beauty part:  By
itself this observation proves nothing, as it is difficult or impossible

Hash: SHA1
The mission defined above is much more ambitious than it may initially
appear, because direct conflicts of interest are hard wired into it.
The "cybersecurity" buzzword embraces a spectrum of practical security
context from protecting consumer financial credentials through
shielding "secret" government databases from unauthorized access, to
preventing malicious alteration of the firmware that runs our civil
and industrial infrastructure.  Privacy is not encompassed by the term
"cybersecurity" as it is intended and understood by those who use
presently use it in a national policy context - but this can and
should change.
Network security addresses practical concerns of privacy, utility,
reliability and cost effectiveness as well as countermeasures to
stereotypical hacker threats.  The express inclusion of privacy
protection in its brief directs the Commission to deliver
recommendations directly counter to the interests of private
enterprises and government departments which presently collect,
analyze, and transfer or act on "private" information about
individuals and groups.  If economic security is taken to include
protecting the revenue streams of dominant U.S. IT vendors and their
associated armies of specialized workers in the field, either
"cybersecurity" or economic security must be sacrificed.  If national
security is taken to include protecting intelligence service access to
surveillance and sabotage targets via widely distributed security
defects in IT products and services, either "cybersecurity" or
national security must be sacrificed.
A security model can not be "just a little bit pregnant."  Every
variance or exception that permits violations of any system's
specified security protocol creates new vulnerabilities that
compromise the security of that system, usually in subtle as well as
obvious ways. Security threats are both external and internal to the
enterprise, and include hackers who want to break in for fun and/or
profit, but also:  Enterprise IT consumers who who make non-negotiable
demands for features and functions that create security
vulnerabilities; senior executives whose golfing buddies know more
about network security than the enterprise's entire IT staff; IT
vendors who are free to hide deficiencies and misrepresent their wares
under immunity from prosecution or civil liability; academics and
consultants whose personal fortunes rise and fall with the value of
vendor-specific credentials; and certified technical workforces whose
educational and occupational background is restricted to a vendor
specific context, and includes mandatory training as outside sales
reps for those same vendors.  Add to this the massive political
influence of dominant U.S. IT vendors' senior executives and major
shareholders, and our picture of an industry hard wired for security
failure is complete.  The expected end result of the complex of
counter-security factors outlined above would be smoking rubble, and
that is and apt description of prevailing network security conditions.
Pervasive "cybersecurity" failures have prompted the Executive branch
to prepare for intervention across both government and private sector
domains; in itself this is evidence that a deep systemic disorder
harmful to the National Interest has been recognized and acknowledged.
 Developing a functional model that explains why an emergency exists
is the first step toward reliably and durably ending it.  The
inclusive nature of the Commission's mandate requires it to address
"cybersecurity" in a holistic manner.  The systemic disorders listed
above are inherent in the present economic and political relationships
of parties whose inputs control IT security across all domains.
Effective solutions will be called "radical" and rightly so, as one
must change the underlying economic and political relationships that
drive the ongoing failure of "cybersecurity" to achieve meaningful
results.  Bolting layers of external reinforcement onto a broken
machine does not fix the machine, only prolongs its ability to produce
broken outputs.  Like an urban renewal project, implementing an
effective national "cybersecurity" strategy begins with a wrecking
ball.  If this is not an acceptable option, "enhanced cybersecurity"
is not a possible outcome.
In the present context, trust has two distinct and nearly opposite
definitions:  In a political context, trust means confidence
cultivated to further a collaborative and/or manipulative agenda.  In
a network security context, trust is a controlled asset whose role is
minimized on every front and excluded where and as possible:  A
trusted actor or system is one that can break your security model.
A competent IT security strategy compartmentalizes, simplifies and
hardens the handling of protected assets.  Tools must be selected and
protocols designed on a case by case basis to enable a given
enterprise or department's necessary functions while minimizing
exposure of its assets to hostile actors.  Trust is rationed, and
dispensed only where and as the benefits of trust outweigh the risks.
As a simple example illustrating the role of trust in "cybersecurity,"
all major web browsers automatically download and execute software as
directed by any website their users visit, without the user's
knowledge or express consent.  Large families of critical security
vulnerabilities grow from this promiscuous trust model.  Many botnets
propagate themselves via this vector, which has also enabled targeted
attacks compromising "secured" assets affecting major corporations and
government agencies.  Browser makers build automatic execution of 3rd
party software into their browsers because both end users and major
commercial website operators demand it.  Vendor efforts to mitigate
this critical security threat by 'sanitizing and sandboxing' incoming
executable code can reduce but not reliably prevent high impact
security incidents arising from a fundamentally insecure trust model.
Informed end users can install tools like NoScript which prevent the
browser from downloading and executing software without the user's
express consent.  Individual websites can be whitelisted by the user,
where and as the benefits of automatically executing arbitrary
software from a given site are believed to outweigh the risks of doing
so.  In practice this trivially simple trust based security measure
has proven itself orders of magnitude more effective than a
promiscuous trust model "mitigated" by complex, failure prone defenses
against hostile code.
Bridging the trust gap between the IT community and the US government
is already a done deal, because there has never been one.  The U.S.
government funded and directed the creation of the IT industry.  As
indicated above, the existing bridges enabling public/private
partnership in IT enterprises create promiscuous trust relationships
in the face of conflicts of interest, perverse incentives and
institutional inertia all working against the objectives of
"cybersecurity."  Rather than reinforcing them, these bridges must be
locked down or removed as the first step toward enhancing
The U.S. government has not alienated the IT community:  It has
shielded this community from liability for fraudulent performance
claims, fed it billions of dollars of annual revenue, and given
Fortune 500 IT corporations nearly full control of government policy
affecting those same corporations.  The intimate partnership of IT
vendors and government decision makers has, however, alienated a large
segment of the public at large.  With regard to privacy concerns, IT
vendors are correctly perceived as the government's partners in
domestic mass surveillance.  The interests of the IT community are
directly served by the government's nearly absolute tolerance for
commercial mass surveillance, inherently insecure products and
protocols, forced obsolescence strategies and abusive marketing
practices - all of which are routinely implemented by major IT vendors
to reduce costs and/or enhance revenues.
The current condition of gross insecurity across private and State
owned IT assets is a product of the dominant role of vendors who are
richly rewarded for exploiting the technological ignorance of private
and public sector decision makers.  The cumulative cost of unstable,
insecure IT infrastructure supplied and serviced by parasitic vendors
greatly exceeds the short term costs of replacement with stable,
security oriented infrastructure; but perverse incentives and
conflicts of interest assure that no such course can be taken absent
dynamic and determined public sector leadership.
Revoke software vendors' blanket immunity from prosecution for
consumer fraud and from liability for damage caused by failure to
control product defects.  Where there is no accountability, there is
no motivation to spend money on security and no rational basis for
consumer trust.  The infallible invisible hand of the Free Market can
not produce security, quality or innovation where the State grants
special immunity from prosecution and civil liability to privileged
Mandate security evaluations based on performance and design metrics
for all software (and firmware) purchased for use by government
agencies and departments.  These evaluations must include examination
of the specific product offerings under consideration, and the
bidder's historical security track record across all products.  Total
cost of ownership calculations for IT assets must include estimated
costs of potential security failures, and projected costs of recovery
from same, proportionally adjusted to reflect the relative security
performance of each competing bidder's products.  This could be
facilitated by the establishment of a transparent, accountable Federal
activity that collects relevant data and produces reports in a
standardized format consistent with government procurement process.
Mandate reporting of security incidents by every government activity,
and every commercial enterprise with a State or Federal tax ID, where
financial losses and costs of remediation and recovery from the
incident exceed $5,000.00.  Require reporting of the category of
failure, specific software tools that presented the vulnerabilities
exploited, direct losses incurred, and the costs of remedial and
recovery measures taken.  Specify that aggregate data from these
reports be made available to the public on at least a quarterly basis.
Direct the Federal Communication Commission to conduct and annually
review studies on the privacy impacts, positive and negative, of
deployed and proposed network communication protocols and Standards,
publicly report their findings, and solicit public comments in a
transparent process.  Mandate that all reports reference IETF RFC
6973, Privacy Considerations, as guidance in identifying, naming and
evaluating adverse and beneficial privacy impacts of deployed and
proposed network communication protocols and architectures.
See above.  A durable commitment of all necessary resources to assure
that the measures suggested in response to query 2 are effectively
implemented would create and sustain rational, constrained trust
relationships affecting all those aspects of "cybersecurity" which are
properly the government's business.
The requirement that recommendations be "realistic" is regrettable.
"Practicable" would have been better language.  A realistic proposal
might be considered as one that will not provoke a do-or-die defense
of the status quo from dominant IT vendors, U.S. intelligence
activities, and others whose bread and butter is "cyber insecurity."
A practicable proposal would be one that is within the scope of public
policy authorities and industry capabilities:  Vendors who assert that
requirements are "impossible" or simply refuse to comply will be
replaced by vendors who are ready to step forward and meet any
challenges presented.  Solutions to many of today's most serious and
widespread network security failures are already avaialbe as off the
shelf products from vendors with excellent security track records.
The proposals presented under query 3 above may not be considered
reasonable by dominant industry stakeholders, but they are
practicable, and these or materially similar policy initiatives are
necessary if the President is serious about getting the results he has
asked for.

I know of a couple of small businesses still running core missions on
Windows 98; in their use cases it "just works" and they see no need to
fix it.  There are still millions of XP installations grinding away
out there.  When a tool has successfully supported necessary business
process for years, rational managers don't replace it until it either
breaks or something comes along that offers a real improvement in the
performance of the enterprise as a whole.  Hence the key roles of
forced obsolescence, managed security failure, and product
misrepresentation in the wonderful world of proprietary software.
Post-apocalypse, Free Software will dominate because of its superior
performance in the context of salvaging and repurposing hardware, and
because it already has a distributed architecture in place for
developing and maintaining software.
The more Free Software we have in our large scale integrated

Nature take its course; after the State collapses, surviving resources
no longer under State control will be up for grabs.
BTW, money as we know it is a fiction created and maintained by the
State for the purpose of enriching the powerful at everyone else's
expense.  See how easy it is to fall into the trap of compliance with
State sponsored assumpitons?  :)
Note that this would only affect the State itself, and those who have
made a positive commitment to submit to State dominion.
This ain't a call for regulation; it's just a call for public
reporting by a State agency.  ;)

would be similar in effect.
For a start, if my (impossible) suggestions were implemented,
Microsoft would lose its most important State protections, all its
government contracts, and a large part of its market share in the
business and consumer markets.  Those product lines would be largely
replaced by UNIX model operating systems, Free software applications,
My first draft was an explicit Microsoft death sentence, I worked
backward from there to create generic, vendor agnostic conditions that
would assure the same result.

Can't say that I see much value in toys created for the purpose of
reinforcing the brand loyalty of Sheeple 2.0 with regard to whatever
Identity Politics trap they have fallen into.  Of course if you /want/
to deploy a stupidity amplifier, anything that constantly reminds a
True Believer that he or she is better than other people will do the
trick.  Does your bright idea help mutually alienate people who might
otherwise band together to promote their common interests at the
expense of their rulers?  Apply for a grant!
Identity politics works by conditioning people to pin their self
esteem on the inherent superiority of their racial, language,
national, economic, social and/or political in-group.  Strict
compliance with the pseudo-gang's rigid stereotypical beliefs and
behaviors makes the faithful Somebodies, and prevents them from
associating with hated Others.
Like all effective propaganda platforms, identity politics formalizes
and exploits a pre-existing human weakness, in this case the so-called
herd instinct.  Identity politics is maintained and advanced through
strategy that consistently scapegoats and demonizes targeted Others
and, to a lesser extent, anyone else who fails to hear and obey the
correct Party Line.  Logic, reason and practicality are off the table,
although simulating these to provide "proofs" of what Believers
already believe is an important part of the complete and balanced
propaganda breakfast.  It's easy, because all issues are reduced to
binary us versus them issues.  The more valid an evidence based
criticism of any article of faith, the more desperately the true
believer clutches for straws:  It doesn't take much to "rescue" them
from wrong thinking.
Otherwise sane and rational people become easily led animals when they
fall under the spell of identity politics; a high IQ only means
superior internal resources for rationalizing ignorant beliefs.
That's where Knee Jerk Reactionary Republicans, Yellow Dog Democrats
and other packaged personlike Product comes from, and how segmented
markets are herded into battles that assure a populace so divided
against itself that its rulers have a free hand to do whatever they
want unopposed, except by easily marginalized outliers and minorities.
Funny thing:  Lots of readers will agree with the above assessment,
because it applies to ignorant easily led Other People, proving that
their own identity group is better.

I would differ /somewhat/ with that position.  There was an antiwar
movement - it brainwashed me, for instance.  But I would not deny that
this movement became a large scale popular 'issue' only because of the
draft:  What does not personally threaten comfortable middle class
people does not get them up on their feet and down to the street.
That's why I support compulsory military service:  It is, in effect,
the conscience of a nation.
I also observed the State's political warfare response to the anti-war
movement as it gained traction:  Sponsorship of the New Left and its
expressly Marxist, pro-war, anti-American message, promoted by
spokespuppets "Hanoi" Jane Fonda et al.
The New Left was repulsive to the vast majority of the U.S. public.
All reasonable efforts were made by network TV to exclude pacifist
messaging from the airwaves, but the New Left was presented and
promoted as a political freak show.  As it "just happened to" take
place at the same time COINTELPRO-sponsored bombings were in progress,
and provided living proof of J. Edna Hoover's assertion that anti-war
organizers were working for the Vast International Communist
Conspiracy, and received nearly unlimited free promotion via mass
media, I am confident that the New Left originated as a State
sponsored black propaganda campaign.
After the fall of Saigon, a coalition of anti-war organizations
headlined by Joan Baez took out a full page ad in the New York Times
condemning Hanoi for the purge (mass murder) in progress against
"reactionaries" in the South - anyone who had worked with the U.S. in
any capacity was subject to summary execution.  In response, a
coalition of pro-war New Left celebrities headlined by Jane Fonda took
out a full page ad congratulating Hanoi on its victory and condemning
the pacifists who dared to criticize proper revolutionary justice.
Once promoted via a full saturation propaganda campaign, the New Left
attracted ideological adherents and "grew legs" of its own.  Although
it was not viable without external support and has since declined to a
historical footnote, the New Left's influence on U.S. political
discourse neatly countered the inherently Populist a.k.a. Anarchist
influence of the anti-war movement, and helped lay the foundation for
the crypto-fascist NeoLiberal ideology and agenda that is so prominent
in U.S. politics today.
And that's all I have to say about that.

The point of failure for a mail order drugs market is the sender:
Receivers are scattered all over and at least "slightly" hard to

organization is small in number and, if suspected, easy to put a mail

The point of failure for a mailed in leaks is the receiver:  The
receiver's location(s) and personnel small in number, and easy to put
a mail cover on.  The receiver might counter this by providing mail
drops and couriers (hopefully) unknown to the opposition, which in
cases like Wikileaks would mean reliance on network security to
transmit a one-time destination address to the prospective leaker.
Again, if the network connection is "secure enough" why not just send

Numerous variations are possible, of course.  I would not consider
either option a categorically superior one in /all/ cases.  When

In what I call a "real" revolution, way more than 99% of the real work
is nonviolent by nature.  Organic changes in the actual process of
social and economic life precede and drive the pressure to change
political and economic institutions rendered obsolete by changes in
the way people actually live.  Efforts expressly targeting obsolete
governing institutions for radical change are also inherently
nonviolent at their inception; only violent counter-attack by
established institutions threatened by organic change motivates public
support for armed resistance.  In turn, homegrown armed insurgencies
depend on the committed support of large networks of non-combatants
for their survival and success.
But there is a limit to the power of strictly nonviolent force;
generally speaking, policy adjustments in commercial and State
institutions can be accomplished by non-violent means, while
successful efforts to affect the abolition or radical restructuring of
commercial and State institutions usually includes armed conflict
during the endgame.  Conversion of a Liberal Fascist State and its
dominant industries to some kind of "level playing field" would be a
very radical change affecting the entire power structure that defines
commercial and State roles and activities; this is MOST unlikely to be
accomplished without prying some people's "cold, dead fingers" off the
levers of power.
Semantics:  Applying "principles for principled ways for us to
interact" is exactly what I meant by "an informed critique of
governments and social orders."  :o)
Direct Democracy a.k.a. Mob Rule is one of my favorite political
concepts; I spread its gospel, and promote it by actually doing it
every chance I get.  But resistance to onerous economic and political
governance is not, in itself, a form of governance; it is a feedback
process which, when successful, governs the governors by
counterbalancing the economic and political power of dominant
syndicates.  My version of Anarchy is the study and practice of Direct
I'll say, and how!  What I was describing is governance as practiced
by many so-called "primitive" people.
Perhaps I should have said, "If you want to go from high level
abstractions to methods that can be implemented in the real world, you
might benefit from considering historical examples."
Consider the example of Iceland, a model democracy where 1/3 million
people have recently demonstrated that self governance is possible
electorate to observe its State and Corporate institutions in action.
Iceland is fortunate in that, at present, the United States sees no
major benefit in interfering with Iceland's internal affairs:  Because
Iceland is a de facto U.S. protectorate, functionally if not
politically part of NATO.  Geographical isolation is Iceland's saving
grace, but alas, it's not one that most of the human race can duplicate.
One thing I appreciate about Anarchists is that they can fight like
cats and dogs over political bullshit, without losing an inch of
respect and solidarity.  Liberals, for instance, often don't make that
cut - which I think is very unfortunate, since "their hearts are in
the right place."
To do that we "have to" explicitly define our terms, distinguish
historical data from abstract constructs, and clearly state material
objectives to assure that our language and data are relevant to the
work at hand.
I am careful to distinguish between a "revolution" that installs a
regime that is responsive to the social and economic demands of the
people as a whole, vs. a "revolution" that installs a regime that
forcibly dictates a social and economic order to the people.  Both are
called "revolutions" but most of the resemblance ends there.
Blatantly repressive Fascist dictatorships call their rise to power
"revolutions" and their autocratic rule "democracy."
A syndicate that has become a dominant force through commercial
competition, by fair means and foul, is already waging economic war
against whatever syndicates its rise to power may inconvenience, and
vice versa.  When an emergent syndicate's growing economic power
threatens to displace syndicates who control political institutions,
overt political conflicts follow.  When the structural roots of the
conflict are sufficiently broad, deep and irreconcilable, a
"revolution" that changes the form of government to accommodate new
industrial, economic and (therefore) political and social realities
may follow.
Although such revolutions often include "shooting wars" the presence
of politically motivated gunfire is not in itself a revolution, nor a
necessary indicator of one.
War takes many forms.  Publicly funded mass murder for private profit
is only one of them.  Shutting down an industry through boycotts,
strikes and blockades is an act of economic warfare.  Destroying the
perceived legitimacy of State institutions through propaganda is an
example of political warfare.
My version of anarchist theory is a study of the dynamics of power in
human social behavior.  The State acts as a referee and enforcer in
conflicts between individuals and between syndicates, in support of
the stability of the dominant syndicates in the territory governed by
the State.  (Example:  The U.S. Federal government defines the
National Interest as the growth of the GNP and profitability of U.S.
based corporate industries.  In many policy contexts and documents,
the National Interest has replaced National Defense as the stated
beneficiary of military actions.)
As changes in technology, population and environmental variables drive
the rise and fall of dominant syndicates, stagnant or declining
syndicates may use their established relationships with the State to
cheat and take advantage, in an effort to retain their dominant
positions.  (A routine example:  Eternal Copyright and DMCA etc. for
media syndicates, conteracting the collapse to near zero of the cost
of reproducing and distributing "creative works.")  Rising syndicates
must acquire enough economic and social power to successfully
challenge both the market dominance of declining syndicates /and/ the
power of the State as it is exercised on behalf of the declining
When changes in real large scale power relationships happen, and the
State fails to adapt itself to these changes due to institutional
commitments to declining syndicates, revolution follows.
This model is exactly contrary to our cradle to grave indoctrination
in the Great Men and Great Ideas model of historical progress, where
revolutions /cause/ radical changes in the world of human affairs.  In
that context, the model I describe makes no sense at all.  But in the
context of the history of technology, it makes almost TOO much sense:
I view anarchist theory and practice as a discipline enabling the
peasant classes of society to form ad hoc syndicates that develop and
exercise social and economic power of their own.  Our rulers seem to
agree with me on this; anarchy has been suppressed by all means
available to ruling class interests since its first appearance in the
Enlightenment era.
Representative Democracy, the "authorized version" of Enlightenment
political organization, attempts to deliver power to the governed via
the electoral process.  I think we can agree that, at best, this
method does not scale well.  But as the old IWW slogan says, "Direct
action gets the goods."
Maybe I'm not expressing myself very well:  All these examples of
things I seem to "deny" are central to my view of how the world
actually works.  Cognitive dissonance may also be at work here:  I
look back at my personal struggles with political concepts and
constantly ask, "Why the hell did it take so long to figure this shit
In the world of human imagination, anything is possible because
wishing makes all things so.  In the physical world, inflexible laws
are self-enforced and can not be wished away.  In the geophysical
world, global warming is just one driver of industrial civilization's
pending collapse:
The slowing but still exponential growth of the human population is
another; the flattening curve of food production capacity and rising
curve of food demand are crossing now.  Topsoil, water, phosphates,
fuel and other essential inputs to agriculture are now approaching
peak extraction / exploitation rates.  This is in addition to, not
because of, the problems inherent in global warming.
Under these conditions the collapse of State and corporate power,
relative to their present massive extent, seems inevitable.
Opportunities for anarchists will be /very/ abundant, and Nature
itself will decide which courses of action are "right."
Back in the 1970s there was a bit of an "appropriate technology"
movement in the same geographic/cultural locus that eventually
produced those strange Cypherpunk critters.  That same gaggle of crazy

I like the generic term "syndicate" for any association of persons,
including meta-associations of groups, seeking common goals in support
of common interests.  Its vaguely ominous connotations tend to
counteract the spin doctored implications of other terminology.
The first corporate charters were in effect for a limited time, with
assigned missions to benefit the interests of the Crown or, in nominal
democracies, the public interest.  Today, corporate persons are
immortal, mutable in form and function, and "the public interest" is
broadly interpreted as economic activity of any kind.
In present usage, a corporation is a fictitious person created by
private fiat per a State-delegated "legal right," and itself has full
civil rights in matters pertaining to commerce.  Today's standard
boiler plate corporate charters specify a corporation's mission as
"all lawful purposes."
So in modern usage, a corporation is a commercial syndicate with
special privileges granted by the State.
How can one "peacefully" tear the dominant syndicates ruling an entire
civilization to pieces?  Those who own and administer those syndicates
have devoted their lives to the acquisition and retention of power, at
the expense of others and in competition against a broad spectrum of
rivals and adversaries.  The modern Democratic State exists for the
sole purpose of protecting and advancing the interests of dominant
economic syndicates and their owners by any means necessary, with
deadly force topping the go-to list.
A whole art and science of nonviolent strategic conflict addresses
methods of applying coercive social and economic measures to modify
the behavior of dominant syndicates including their State
sponsor/clients.  But an existential threat to these syndicates will
ultimately result in their application of deadly force, and a response
in kind.
Anarchy is not a proposed form of government or social order; it is an
informed critique of governments and social orders.  Or it is a
delusional belief system indoctrinated by propaganda.  Or it is
violent opposition to social order of any kind.  Depends who you ask.
If you want an anarchistic society, you will need to keep units of
sovereign governance small enough that everyone can observe and play
an active role in their governance.  You need to govern that State in
a manner that never delegates decision making power; decision making
by consensus assures that very few non-emergency decisions will be
made at all; thus, State interference in private affairs will be very
In short, you need to model your State as Bands, Tribes and Nations
governed by open Councils acting on consensus only.  And you need to
site it on a world where no other kind of State exists or can arise,
because hierarchal governance in a caste system includes efficiencies
that will enable other States to take yours over shortly after they
see advantages in doing so.  At best your Anarchistic State may
survive by imitating the organizational methods of antagonistic States
- - but then, you will no longer have an Anarchistic State.
The problem with "revolution" is semantic:  We are taught that a
revolution is an armed conflict that replaces one gang of rulers with
another gang of rulers, who may or may not bring plans for a new
social and economic structure with them.
My favorite definition of "revolution" equates it to "the world turned
upside down."
We are taught that revolutions initiate radical changes in social and
economic systems, but I maintain that revolutions are the end result
of radical changes in social and economic behavior.  We are taught
that Great Leaders with Great Ideas change the world, but I maintain
that changes in technology, population and environmental conditions
change the world:  Those Great Leaders with their Great Ideas show up
taken place.  They represent new dominant syndicates, seeking to
displace institutions of governance created by and for the exclusive
benefit of earlier dominant syndicates.  Their role is to modify the
institutions of State power to codify, control and exploit the new
order, for the sole benefit of the new dominant syndicates.
According to this model, the "shooting war" phase of a real revolution
serves the sole purpose of removing dead-end resistance to rule by new
dominant syndicates that have already eclipsed the power of previously
dominant syndicates.
The French and American Revolutions removed the institutions of
Monarchy to make way for a New World Order where insurgent Mercantile
and Industrialist factions share power with the older "landed"
Aristocracy.  That New World Order developed under Monarchy; its
revolutions only restructured political power to reflect a new
arrangement of economic powers already in place, and establish the new
dominant syndicates as its "legitimate" rulers.
No evolution, no revolution.  Unless by "revolution" one means
overthrowing the State to replace it with a new State administering
the same social and economic systems the old State evolved to control
and exploit.  In this case, revolutionaries are those who seek power
for its own sake through violent means; that is not likely to end well.
The real future includes the collapse of industrial economies,
accelerated looting of under-defended territories, and a major human
population crash.  This is the picture presented by current and
historical geophysical data.  Any plan or strategy that does not work
in this context does not work.
Absent a paradigm shift that replaces "progress" with "disaster
mitigation, management and recovery," application of political theory
and practice can only produce worse outcomes, not better ones.
My proposed solution is radical decentralization of industry and
agriculture; adaptation of "low technology" not dependent on
centralized heavy industry to replace "high technology" where and as
it has real survival value; moving as many people as far away from
population centers as possible; and distributing field tested
strategies and technologies for the above as widely as possible while
the networks and economies to do so are still up and running.
Large scale industrial processes that systematically destroy the
essential survival resources of future generations have to be halted
as soon as possible.  Hydraulic fracturing to harvest petrochemicals
permanently destroys water tables.  It is now decades too late to
"stop" global warming, but not too late to limit the rate of onset,
severity, and duration of large scale climactic disruptions on the way
to a "new normal."  Genetically engineered 'food' crops destroy
topsoil ecologies, poison water supplies and threaten the genetic
integrity of plant species necessary to large scale human survival.
The longer these and other grossly destructive industrial activities
continue, the lower the resulting long term carrying capacity for
human population in affected regions.
Preparation for and mitigation of the "end of the world as we know it"
provides more than a lifetime of challenging, satisfying, useful work.
 Any real progress in these areas will produce a better future,
sooner, for more people.

leading to the illusion that it means extinction, it is not
unsurvivable.  Humans are the toughest weeds Nature ever made, capable
of living on pack ice or dry rock desert for half the year armed only
with Neolithic technology ... and loving it.  What will the first
couple of Post Apocalyptic generations make out of the mangled
landscapes and derelict infrastructure of Civilization?  A new kind of
civilization, of course.
That thing that happened in Europe after the Black Death?  Homo Sap
ain't seen nothing yet:  This time it's global, and post-scarcity is
among the possible outcomes.
We don't see interstellar "civilizations" very often, because those
who did not get over making everything bigger and more powerful for
sake of bigness and power didn't make it.  For reals.  Some of those
gamma bursts may be industrial accidents, or Bad Outcomes to MAD based
defense strategies (an especially stupid kind of industrial accident).
If the absence of torrents of long range EM message traffic is
surprising, that's only because we presume aliens talk with strings
and tin cans "just like us."  If the absence of star drive signatures
is surprising, it's more likely that our assumptions about what those
signatures would be are faulty, than that there are no interstellar
voyagers riding the starwinds.  If the absence of physical visitors is
surprising, that just means a lot of people have not taken a hard
critical look at UFO investigations:  Failure to invade and loot or
otherwise dominate a technologically weaker species' cradle planet may
be evidence of the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence, rather
than its absence.
In my view practical anarchism is much more about developing
adaptations for conditions after the fall of Civilization, than with
making Civilization fall.  The latter task has already been done for
us gratis [not], by the Powers and Principalities of the world.
Building the best future possible for kids born in 2150 is gonna be a

When dredging the Internet for information, I am sure you won't have
much trouble picking out the State sponsored anarchist literature and
pseudo-radical propaganda fronts:  Rebel As You Are Told is one of the
oldest and most powerful political warfare strategies in the
opposition's playbook.
Anarchists don't worry much about labeling sources and concepts as,
for instance, Left or Right.  The relevant question is, Useful or Not?
 In addition to State directed wannabe anarchists who rebel as they
are told, we also have a bumper crop of people who believe that adding
the prefix an- or anarcho- to the name of any archaic, failed or
outright delusional "political philosophy" makes it hip and relevant.
A lot of anarchist literature does not appear to be political.
Anarchists also make a point of reading and exploiting the
opposition's textbooks; there are such things as laws of physics,
natural processes, principles of strategy, etc. that hold constant no
matter who studies them.  "It's a piss poor pitiful Anarchist, who
refuses to use the State's resources against the State's interests."
Just now I am reading this:
It's an in depth survey of political warfare theory and practice in
the context of politically motivated popular uprisings.  There's not a
bit of Anarchy in it, except that everything in it is of potential use
to anarchists.  While reading just substitute self rule or autonomy
for "Democracy," and anarchist or radical for "democrat," and viola:
Radical literature fit to be suppressed by any self respecting
sovereign State.  (The U.S. Federal government tolerates and even
funds this kind of literature, because it is intended for distribution
in "unfriendly regimes" overseas.)
All of these titles are relevant to practical anarchy:
The Tao Te Ching can rightly be called an anarchist classic.  I quote
it more often than any other source, both in correspondence and to
myself.  I like the D.C. Lau translation:
Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication is very popular with the
anarchist crowd.  Handle with care, this is highly refined weapons
grade pacifist material:

Here's a fun movie:  It's a biography of Emma Goldman, one of the most
famous Anarchists of the 20th century.  She was a Russian Jew who moved
to America as soon as she was old enough and raised hell non-stop from
then on.  At the height of her career she was the most popular political
speaker in the U.S. of A.

The 'collateral murder' video hit Iraq during negotiations with the
3rd (?) post-conquest iteration of an allegedly sovereign Iraqi
government for continued U.S. occupation and control of Iraq.  It
pissed the Iraqi public off so badly that continued 100% immunity from
local prosecution of U.S. persons for any and all crimes including
murder was taken off the table.  In consequence of this, the U.S.
occupation force was pulled out of Iraq.  This was more than a little
inconvenient, it was bloody expensive.
The U.S. proxy force "formerly known as" ISIS have a dual mission:
West of the Syria/Iraq border, the ongoing destabilization of Syria to
prevent construction of oil & gas pipelines from Iran to a
BRICS-friendly Mediterranean seaport.  East of the border, to force
the Iraqis to allow U.S. occupation forces back in to "protect" Iraq
from an invading armed force and assure continued US/NATO control of
Iraqi oil.
The Cablegate and War Diaries releases both stirred diplomatic
anthills, complicating or terminating numerous U.S. foreign policy
operations in progress, causing direct losses on numerous fronts and
imposing global scale damage control tasks.  All of the above cost
money - a damn lot of it - and tied up human resources that would have
otherwise been very productively engaged in business as usual, i.e.
looting the planet.
Compare and contrast this impact to that of the well controlled
Snowden leak, which has caused a bit of embarrassment while serving
the practical purpose of putting the U.S. civilian population on
notice that Big Brother really is watching their every move.  On the
domestic political warfare front, State and Corporate actors would not
necessarily view this as a Bad Thing, as cultivating paranoia is one
of their long term self-defense missions.
Somebody probably located in Germany has since handed the world NSA
docs with more practical impact on U.S. espionage operations than the
whole Snowden Affair to date, and the U.S. public at large has no idea
it even happened.  Propaganda costs money and nobody on this side of
the Atlantic seems to be interested in paying for play in this case.
I would not call that a 'fact' without considering that physically
mailing storage media has its own inherent risks.  IIRC, Wikileaks'
advertised postal addresses are in "Five Eyes" territory, so nothing
will be delivered via post without e-z and unavoidable State
inspection and approval.  Arranging any physical delivery method that
might be more secure would require two-way communication in advance
with Wikileaks, so why not simplicate matters by using the same
"secure" comms channel to transmit the docs and have done with it?

According to an article in Forbes a couple of years ago, 400
billionaires own 1/2 the capital assets in the United States
(population 370+ million).  I find it ridiculous to credit that
"democratic self rule" could exert any substantial influence on the
political destiny of that nation.
In an economically and industrially developed nation with mature
democratic institutions, the function of the State is to convert money
into power, and power back into money, in an accelerating feedback
cycle - for the benefit of the rich, at the expense of the poor.
Details of how this process is administered vary from venue to venue
but no large going-concern State fails to evolve into a form that
serves this simple functional purpose.
Conspiracy Theory is a propaganda meme created by the CIA and
promulgated through a memo circulated to its agents in mass media
outlets (print and broadcast), advising them on how to stomp down
independent investigations of the JFK murder.
When a narrative is labeled Conspiracy Theory, that means it's
considered harmful to State and Corporate interests, regardless of
whether it is factual or fanciful, and is targeted for disposal by
State and Corporate propaganda assets.
The Big Lie is a three phase process:  First, a manufactured spectacle
is created to grab the public's attention; second, the shocking event
is explained through a full saturation propaganda campaign prepared in
advance and launched on the same day; finally, a long term political
warfare campaign counters factual reporting that contradicts the Big
Lie narrative.  The Big Lie works through mechanisms of imprinted
emotional memory and cognitive dissonance; the more "intelligent" and
"morally responsible" the victim, the more resources he or she will
effortlessly and automatically deploy to defend the Big Lie, a.k.a.
"what I know in a factual and moral sense to be true," from the
corrosive influence of mere facts.
Example:  The 911 Truth Movement includes competent investigators who
have published highly defensible conclusions, as exemplified by the
Architects & Engineers For 911 Truth organization.  It also includes
black propaganda assets who very successfully promote "proofs" of
prima facie delusional and irrational assertions about the 911 mass
murder via social network campaigns, staining factual narratives as
delusional and irrational by association.
Proof that no planes hit the WTC towers is presently making the
rounds.  Proofs that silent invisible nuclear bombs, ray guns fired
from orbit, and that missiles strapped to the airliners were used to
collapse three buildings at WTC are also in the rotation.  This is an
example of service after the sale for a Big Lie, providing True
Believers converted by the initial propaganda effort with handy
excuses for dismissing factual narratives as "something those ignorant
lunaticks believe."  Because the State sanctioned delusional beliefs
about the 911 mass murder are sustained by emotional imprints and
support a larger delusional complex ("the State protects the lives and
interests of the people") reasoned arguments are not required to keep
the believers on track; depicting critics of the State narrative as
fools is sufficient.
Conspiracy studies, which range in quality from excellent to fucking
ridiculous, have made a very successful transition from pulp magazines
and mimeographed newsletters to the Internet, where both fact and
fantasy flourish thanks to the near-zero costs of publication and
distribution.  Unfortunately for the human race, the fictional
narratives spread much faster than factual ones and become rigid
beliefs affecting millions of people.
The right name for "serious conspiracy theory" is intelligence
analysis.  This is an inherently complex and demanding field offering
no certainties, only weighted estimates of what is probably going on
in the real world.  It should come as no surprise that bullshit
narratives written at the 6th grade level, offering instant easy
answers to every mystery and implicit cure-all solutions to all the
world's problems, outsell and overshadow evidence based research.
Unwinding this problem is easy, if you have the necessary skills and
attitudes.  Exposing it in a meaningful way is impossible, unless we
can somehow make people smarter, better educated, and motivated to
question their own assumptions from time to time.

As a student of propaganda, I see two-value reasoning like this as
either a cognitive error by a naive writer, or an attempt by a
sophisticated writer to encourage and exploit two-value reasoning in
others.  Either way, the appropriate response is the same:  Call the
respondent's emotionally driven irrational snap judgment what it is,
and put the focus back on practical realities.
Two value judgments of security tools and protocols are assertions
that they are either "secure" or "insecure."  But in real life, there
are no absolutes - least of all in the sphere of network security.  If
one insists on a guarantee that any particular tool or technique will
always work, the answer is always "impossible, so why bother - you're
screwed anyway."  That is why propagandists employed by State and
Corporate actors do promote this attitude.
Those who can be pulled into two-value reasoning will either be
defeated by the false assumption that their chosen "unbreakable"
methods provide 100% security against all adversaries, or refuse to
deploy /any/ security measures because "we're all screwed anyway."
That latter position is easier to sell, because it provides a
rationalization for ignorance and laziness.  But either way, the bad
guys gain major advantages because their targets are following bad advic
I do not make an argument that "we're all screwed anyway."  I do
present (what I think is) a novel and seldom if ever discussed general
technique for defeating anonymizing mix networks that rely on
distributed routing protocols, where the routers operators are
effectively "anonymous" and any number of routers can be stood up by
one adversary.  I only point out that this can be done by using VPN
connections from a cloud server running modified router instances, to
a large number of physical endpoints masquerading as legitimate routers.
This method is very similar in terms of physical deployment to a known
NSA program called "More Cowbells" and could, in principle, be
deployed via the same "Packaged Goods" boxes which per report are
already widely distributed around the world to implement the said NSA
If the attack I describe is practical - and there seems to be a
consensus that it is - the points, plural, are:
1)  Users who have been encouraged to believe that their comms can be
hidden from a well funded adversary just by using the anonymizing
network overlays available today, need to know about practicable
attacks available against the tools in question, so they can make
informed judgment calls and adjust their tactics accordingly.
2)  Developers of anonymizing network overlay technology need to know,
so they can evaluate the threats presented, work toward creating
countermeasures, and adjust the performance claims made for their
products accordingly.
3)  Advocates of anonymizing network overlay technology need to know,
in order to adjust their expectations and representations accordingly,
and contribute to mitigations or solutions as best they are able.
One practical counter-attack to the threat model I call a Hydra (one
body, many heads) is stupidly simple:  Create more traffic than the
Hydra can handle, by transitioning the whole network infrastructure -
or a significant fraction of it - to anonymized mix networking.
This response is not practicable today, but one may be permitted to
hope for the best in the long term:  The See IETF RFC 6973, Privacy
Considerations, which recognizes privacy as a fundamental network
security and quality of service issue and provides a rational
framework for addressing the specific issues relevant to privacy in
Until or unless anonymized routing becomes as much a part of routine
network comms as, for instance, SSH/SSL, we will just have to make do
with existing conditions, mitigating threats against available tools
by adjusting our trust models to reflect the real world, and applying
physical security methods to enhance network security where and as
this is considered desirable.

The great unwashed publick actually believes that "free speech" means
privately owned publishers have to let them say whatever they want, on
the given publishers' dime.  Isn't that cute?  Meanwhile, playing the
game of publishing arbitrary propaganda "for free" through social
media outlets is a whole 'nother thing.  Weasels ride for free, but
others may need to launch Big Stories (ahem) that would trigger the
Streisand Effect if they were taken down.  As illustrated in the
thread above.
Meanwhile, this seems to provide an excuse to get out my soap box.
The Facebook, as any good CPunk should know, is one of the twin crown
jewels of U.S. domestic mass surveillance, the other being Google.
The Facebook's national infrastructure was capitalized by DARPA's
financiers, and soon afterward propagandized with front page
placements in "student" newspapers throughout the U.S. (local sports
hero asserts The Facebook is life vs. death in campus social scene,
same template from coast to coast).  That worked brilliantly.  As soon
as its infrastructure was built out to accommodate really explosive
growth, The Facebook started accepting subscribers without .edu e-mail
accounts.  Given the identity of its de facto owners, this makes The
Facebook a classic study in large scale covert political warfare.
Then someone read The Facebook's terms of service and privacy policy,
and started talking.  In summary, by signing up one agreed to be
placed under ongoing surveillance through every vector available to
The Facebook; to allow The Facebook to integrate all intel collected
against the user and offer it for sale to all comers; and of course
granting The Facebook a non-exclusive but unlimited license to publish
any and everything submitted by the user, in a wrapper (c) The
Facebook, forever and ever amen.
The great unwashed publick was shocked - shocked, I tell ya! - and The
Facebook's terms and conditions were promptly amended to obfuscate the
surprisingly honest (insider sabotage?) original, and mitigate
whatever damage it did.  Meanwhile, under the radar, The Facebook
enabled NSA to outsource tons of collection and pre-processing for its
Rumsfeld-given Total (er, I mean, Terrorist) Information Awareness
program, /and/ made that service pay for itself.
Since then, widely publicized and briefly influential articles and
videos documenting the U.S. intelligence community's controlling
interest in The Facebook have gone down the memory hole.  So have the
early Facebook TOS docs:  I went digging for both a few days ago and
abracadabra, no trace of either turned up.  I am sure that a more
determined effort would find hot leads in old list archives & etc;
"Big Brother, Big Facebook," "Orwellian Social Network," and similar
strings might be productive.
I have an account on The Facebook.  I was a very late adopter; my only
initial interest was in testing promotional tools integrating websites
with The Facebook:  The "liek" buttons scattered like JS land mines
across millions of seemingly harmless websites; my own versions of
same that do not phone home to Zuckerberg unless deliberately
activated by the visitor; the uses and abuses of company Facebook
pages; and etc.  "The customer gets what the customer wants."
But eventually I decided to start using The Facebook to distribute
propaganda; it's not like this tells Big Brother anything about me
that's not already being collected.  Depending the propaganda you pump
out and the audience you cultivate, The Facebook can give productive
results - especially if you are interested in engaging IRL with
political activists, organizers and radicals.  The Other Side has
already spotted you; might as well let Our Team do so as well.
The Facebook is an environmental condition; a pervasive fungus on the
networks that is only as toxic to the user as the user's ignorance
enables it to be.
And that's all I have to say about that.

If the latter, that's a perilous course.  One sees a lot of "twin"

gradually overwhelmed.
When the means to eliminate a public voice by direct force are not
practicable, death by a thousand paper cuts may get the job done.
Splitting an online forum may be a decisive move in that direction, or
harmless and productive, depending the situation.  As someone already

provide more or less what any advocates for moderation could ask for.

Technologists are likely to assume that political problems are
products of stupidity, and that putting their own kind of intelligence
in the driver's seat would automatically create optimum solutions to
all those problems.  Maybe so, but only if that intelligence is given
relevant and accurate data to work from:  Context is everything, and
in a world dominated by indoctrinated ideologies nothing is more
subversive than the facts.
The article cited in the original post is a commentary on this essay:
Wherein Brzezinski says:
"While no state is likely in the near future to match Americaâs
economic-financial superiority, new weapons systems could suddenly
endow some countries with the means to commit suicide in a joint
tit-for-tat embrace with the United States, or even to prevail.
Without going into speculative detail, the sudden acquisition by some
state of the capacity to render America militarily inferior would
spell the end of Americaâs global role. The result would most probably
be global chaos. And that is why it behooves the United States to
fashion a policy in which at least one of the two potentially
threatening states becomes a partner in the quest for regional and
then wider global stability, and thus in containing the least
predictable but potentially the most likely rival to overreach.
Currently, the more likely to overreach is Russia, but in the longer
run it could be China.
"Since the next twenty years may well be the last phase of the more
traditional and familiar political alignments with which we have grown
comfortable, the response needs to be shaped now. During the rest of
this century, humanity will also have to be increasingly preoccupied
with survival as such on account of a confluence of environmental
challenges. Those challenges can only be addressed responsibly and
effectively in a setting of increased international accommodation. And
that accommodation has to be based on a strategic vision that
recognizes the urgent need for a new geopolitical framework.
... and that's a paradigm shift, coming as it does from the man who
created Al Qaida and laid the foundation for today's business as usual
methods for regime change a.k.a. NeoColonial conquest.
We now return to our regularly scheduled Cypherpunks, a world of pure
imagination where smart people like us would rise to the top of the
social hierarchy on merit alone and fix the world, if only those
damned [scapegoat name here] would get the hell out of our way.

That seems to equate nonviolent political warfare with martyrdom.
Along with "pacifism means passive-ism", that's a supporting script
for Rebel As You Are Told, a widespread, long running Statist
propaganda mission.  The message that "nonviolence equals helplessness
and can not work" is primarily intended to help prevent anti-war
movements, but is equally applicable to helping prevent successful
populist uprisings on any domestic front.  Per case histories,
successful revolutionary wars are won before the first (openly
acknowledged) shot is fired.  And even in "doomed" situations,
nonviolent political warfare methods can directly save lives, and keep
underground movements alive as well.
Some case histories:  Disregarded History by Gene Sharp, 14 pages.
Everybody from the Albert Einstein Institute to U.S. Army counter
insurgency training programs agrees:  To succeed, a home-grown armed
insurgent force needs a much larger base of committed non-combatant
supporters to succeed.  Without this base the insurgent force must
rely on support from wealthy patrons or foreign States, which moves
the context from "liberation" to "regime change," with a big quid pro
quo due and payable on the success of efforts to displace existing
State institutions.
Right on.  Fuck Anarchism - as a label or worse, an identity.  But
anarchism does provide a frame of reference for political analysis and

include posting links to live HTML-borne exploits against browsers or

One normally thinks of sabotage as attacks against physical or digital
COINTELPRO was a Hoover-era FBI political warfare program, grounded in
the proposition that U.S. Civil Rights, Anti-War and radical political
activities in general were 5th column operations sponsored and
controlled by communist States.  Calling today's U.S. domestic
political warfare programs COINTELPRO is reminiscent of Conspiracy

mind control operations MKULTRA (and spell it wrong).
I seem to be missing the real fun.  Lemme see the sabotage and

Also, grammar nazi time:  "misdirection and control of a internet

Proofs only exist in formal systems like maths and geometry, and then
only because those systems expressly define what constitutes a proof
within the given system.  In the real world, one may collect evidence
based on observation, analysis and experiment, leading to varying
degrees of confidence in various conclusions:  A massive weight of
evidence supports the first law of thermodynamics, but no one will
ever prove it "true."
In purely practical terms, demonstrating that one economic and social
system works better than another economic and social system depends on
two things:  The definition of "better" and observation of full scale
practical implementations.  The massive number of variables, feedbacks
and turbulence in economic and social systems rule out accurately
predicting outcomes based on thought experiments or simulations.
"Proof" invokes two value reasoning, which strongly appeals to human
cognitive and emotional biases but can not accurately model any but
the very simplest of systems in the material world.  Propagandists
love to exploit two value reasoning:  I have found that the presence
of the word "proof" in the title of a story circulated on the Internet

print the names of two reported undercover CIA officers whom you claim
have been involved in the hunt against al Qa'ida." They had used this
approach successfully several times in the past to persuade some of

Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, among others --
to withhold her name from the public. Seeking advice from the ACLU's

aware that she had become something of an open secret in his world.
They had stumbled onto a hornet's nest. Bikowsky, as it turned out,
was the person credited internally with the greatest PR coup of the
Obama White House, the successful assassination earlier that year of
Osama bin Laden. As chief of the Global Jihad Unit, she reportedly
runs the nation's drone strikes program. She is a through-line running
from the failure to prevent 9/11 to the push for war in Iraq to the
development of the CIA's renditions, black sites, and torture program
and continuing to today's targeted assassinations in countries around
the world. Through her story, we can see the details of a devolution
in the rule of law and the justice system in America, as well as the
impetus for and birth of what some call the "war on whistleblowers and
journalists." For 20 years, she has been at the center of history, yet

fighting among themselves; and cut-throat competition within and

the military that has benefited the most in its enhanced power, although
the corporate circles have also become more explicitly entrenched in the

in which even the President now exercises little substantive control
over the overall direction of U.S. national security policy. Whereas
Britainâs dual institutions evolved towards a concealed republic,
Americaâs have evolved in the opposite direction, toward greater

In my view, Religion is about ideology and Politics is about power.
Since Greed is about power, a political revolution has little if
anything to do with ideology, except in that ideological propaganda
(emotionally charged fact-free bullshit) is always employed to
persuade people to support and participate in revolutions - or to
violently oppose them, as the propagandists' employers may direct.
Well duh.  Before the American Revolution, holders of Crown land
grants were the most wealthy and powerful people in the Colonies.
After the American Revolution, former holders of Crown land grants
were the most wealthy and powerful people in the States.  The U.S.
Constitution was written for the purpose of creating a Federal
authority capable of stomping down popular uprisings against abuses of
power by these same de facto rulers.
American racism was invented by the same fine folks, as a response to
slave uprisings earlier in Colonial history:  By granting White
"indentured" slaves special privileges, they successfully divided the
conquered.  That process has continued uninterrupted, with adaptations
to accommodate changing conditions, until the present day: In Obama's
Amerika, any black person with a Master's Degree or above is as good
as any white person - all others pay in blood.
Which is why we need more revolutions, beginning with establishing
alternative ways of life that reduce or eliminate the role of today's
rulers and the passionately held, completely false Truths they dictate
to our own communities.  Big job?  The biggest.  If not for the

Collusion between Legislators, Judges, Prosecutors and other attorneys
make it so.  Software code is interpreted by machines without
conflicts of interest or hands out for bribes.  Legal code is
interpreted by semi-humans who chose "power over others" as their
career path and invested a lot of energy and money in gaining that power
A reasonable time to demonstrate the painful ignorance and delusional
beliefs our rulers have given us, to assure that we stay ruled.  Armed
insurrection, before the revolution process has even started, is a
gesture of suicide/surrender we have been taught to perform.  Think of
it as the ultimate act of obedience to established authority.
A revolution is won or lost before the first publicly acknowledged
shot is fired.  The shooting war is the last phase, its purpose to pry
the fingers of a stubborn ruling class off the levers of power /after/
their rule has already been rendered obsolete and irrelevant by
changes in the actual economic and social behavior of their subjects.
 Otherwise it's a coup, not a revolution.  A revolution is "the world
turned upside down."  A coup just changes out the old bastards for a
new set of bastards, usually worse ones.
The people in those Crown Colonies that became United States started
refusing to pay taxes and surcharges, ignoring the orders of Crown
authorities, and constructing their own systems of commerce and
governance long before that "shot heard 'round the world."  The
Revolutionary War was more a response to a campaign by the Crown to
take the Colonies back over, than a struggle to kick established
rulers out.  That is why the Revolutionary War had the necessary
organization and mass public support to succeed.
I found the bits of this essay addressing the Revolutionary War very

PGP, Scramdisk, etc., and the teams working on them have their own

In the context of the Cold War, now arriving at the boiling point due
to the Bush/Obama Administration's belligerent posture toward Russia,
the U.S. annexation of Ukraine via a (literally) Nazi proxy force
makes strategic sense:  It was a destabilizing military and economic
provocation against the Russian Federation, and has been followed by a
massive conventional force buildup on Europe's eastern borders, adding
pressure to the weight of U.S. controlled strategic nuclear assets
that were /already/ present on that border.  These deployments must be
countered, which ties up Russian military assets and reduces that
country's force projection capabilities in North Africa and the Middle
Russia's continuing support of the ethnic Russian enclave on Ukraine's
eastern border also makes strategic sense:  It prevents full
consolidation of power by the U.S. installed government, prevents
routine deployment of East-facing U.S. controlled forces on the
Ukraine/Russian border, and provides a potential haven for Ukrainian
insurgents working against the government in Kiev.
Crimea's value to Russia is self explanatory, and I do not recall
hearing anything about the populace turning out to protest the orderly
handover of power to Russia in preference to a U.S. sponsored gang of
(literal) Nazis.  Rather the opposite, and I saw no evidence that the
U.S. even /tried/ to retain Crimea.
The "USA Number One!" mentality of comfortable Middle Class Amerikans
makes sense of a kind: Their continued material prosperity relative to
the former Working Class /does/ depend on global terrorism, enforced
poverty, mass murder, cities reduced to rubble and refugee columns,
etc. as the U.S. war of global economic conquest continues.  They
deserve to see the same things happen to their own children and
families, and if they continue to get their own way they WILL see that
- - unless they happen to be closer to ground zero "on the day."
Unfortunately, this cheerful little scenario involves dragging those
bodies down into the same hell.
The real conflict here is not West vs. East or even USA vs. The Rest
Of The World.  It is the human race, vs. its own parasitic ruling
class and their faithful servants.  The parasites have already lost;
if they do not surrender their power voluntarily (impossible),
environmental limits enforced by the laws of physics will destroy that
power (inevitable).  Now the only game in town is about reducing the
final body count, which no rational scenario places at less than a
couple of billion, and preserving essential long term survival
resources for the survivors.  And that's where radical populist

Tim Berners-Lee just gave us an opening to stop DRM in Web standards
Submitted by Zak Rogoff on October 6, 2016 - 12:27pm
This week, the chief arbiter of Web standards, Tim Berners-Lee,
decided not to exercise his power to extend the development timeline
for the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) Web technology standard. The
EME standardization effort, sponsored by streaming giants like Google
and Netflix, aims to make it cheaper and more efficient to impose
Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) systems on Web users. The
streaming companies' representatives within the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) were unable to finish EME within the time allotted by
the W3C, and had asked Berners-Lee for an extension through next year.
Berners-Lee made his surprising decision on Tuesday, as explained in
an email announcement by W3C representative Philippe Le HÃ©garet.
Instead of granting a time extension â as he has already done once â
Berners-Lee delegated the decision to the W3C's general
decision-making body, the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee
includes diverse entities from universities to companies to
nonprofits, and it is divided as to whether EME should be part of Web
standards. It is entirely possible that the Advisory Committee will
reject the time extension and terminate EME development, marking an
important victory for the free Web.

from two of the most powerful industries in the world:  Petrochemicals

again:  A delaying action that only costs a few million dollars, while
enabling its sponsoring industries to harvest tens of billions of
dollars while a fabricated "debate" drags on, is a net winning strategy.
"Unique viewpoints" in the physical sciences /rarely/ turn out to be
useful.  When they are not products of simple error or crackpot

Ain't no "if" about that collapse; "when" would be more accurate.  To
condense the behavior and design-mandated outcomes of industrial
civiliation into one sentence:  Unchecked exponential growth inside a
closed container does not end well.  That applies to the global
material economy, which has already exceeded hard limits and /will/
produce mass casualty events.
And the wonderful achievements of Progressive Liberalism only cost us:
 Ongoing wars of economic conquest, enforced poverty and de facto
slavery in the NeoColonies, refugee columns headed north from North
Africa and the Middle East, massive environmental degradation at home
and abroad, and upcoming mass casualty events on a scale never before
Here in the USA we have epidemics of non-communicable diseases (due to
"necessary economies" in industrial food production), a positively

between the ruling class and peasants than was present in feudal
societies.  And, oh joy, the U.S. domestic economy is being looted by
military interests while State Security forces are being rolled in to
"contain and control" a projected large scale popular uprising.
But our "homeless people" can have a shiny toy to compensate them for
their lack of basic security and so-called necessities.  Yes, they are
marginally better off than (for instance) the residents of cities
bombed out by U.S. proxy forces to protect and serve the U.S. National

better off; all boats rise on the tide of blood.

participate in rationalizations supported by a propaganda regimen that

happen are absolutely someone else's fault.  That propaganda is paid
for, along with everything else supporting Middle and Ruling Class
lifestyles, by the ongoing war of global economic conquest that keeps
the engines of Western Civilization running at full throttle.  That
engine is fueled by the blood of innocents.
Today's "comfortable" lifestyles are capitalized by borrowing against
a future that will not happen, and every passing year of business as
usual makes the upcoming crash worse.  We are not in hock to human
creditors who can be bribed or bullied to forgive the debt; we are up
against cold equations imposed by the laws of physics.
Blame the victims, and anyone who disagrees with you about how fucking
wonderful Industrial Age civilization is.  That's the Party line.
Meanwhile, the "mature, responsible citizens" who parrot that
propaganda line do not WISH for their relatives to be raped and
killed:  They support the rape and murder of whole cities, which pays
for their comfortable, upwardly mobile lifestyle.  They also pointedly
ignore the fact that their own families WILL face that kind of
deprivation and violence as an unavoidable natural consequence of
living in a purely self-serving fantasy world.

In a real fight, the winners are those who walked away intact - and
ideally that includes the aggressor.  I have only been assaulted three
times; and three times, both myself and my assailant walked away
physically unharmed.  Just lucky I guess.
In a game there are agreed rules, and participation is voluntary.  In
an assault, there will be one or more assailants, and one or more
intended victims who did not agree to participate.  In a game, the
object is to win.  In a fight, the object is to stop the assault.
Game theory is a branch of mathematics that attempts to model natural
processes; it has numerous applications in combat, but combat is not a
game:  At any scale, combat is the process of an assault in progress.  "
I prefer terms like "systems dynamics" rather than "games" in this
context, because the word "games" has way too many loaded connotations.
In the political organizations I participate in, decisions are made by
consensus and specific tasks necessary to carry out those decisions
are delegated to volunteers.  A trusted facilitator has some influence
but no real power.
The 10/90 rule states that in voluntary organizations, 10% of the
participants do 90% of the work; it's a fairly accurate estimator.  If
enough of that 10% gets pissed off and walks out, the organization
falls over; that is the real power structure I have seen in the field,
and it is a reasonably healthy one.
If the neighborhood committee should happen to turn predatory, oh
well, at least the other locals will have a fresh historical example
of how to deal with the problem.
I can't remember an example of a flash mob that accomplished a
political political objective.  Flash mobs garnered some publicity
when the fad was still going on, but publicity is a tool, not an
objective.  All wishful thinking aside, knowing better does not make
things better - just "getting the word out" accomplishes nothing in
politics unless followed up immediately with organized action.  Maybe
that's why the "flash mob" thing came, saw, and left.
An organization is an instance of "organic" cooperation toward shared
goals, with coordinated division of functions among the participants.
 The definition as a system where dictates flow from leaders to
subordinates seems pathological to me.  Homey don't play that.
When an organization's power is established and maintained by violent
means that organization is already terminally corrupt.  It may grow
larger and more powerful, it may deploy more overt and larger scale
forms of violence, but it will not become more corrupt.
When an organization's power is established and maintained by mutual
aid in unified resistance to violence, that organization will be
inherently resistant to corruption, more so if it proves itself
competent by acquiring real power by using nonviolent force successfully
Humans are, collectively, a major pain in the ass.  If you insist that
any organization with humans in it must be foolproof, you must insist
that there BE no organizations - as apparently stated above.
But no organization means no power.  No power means no results, and no
push-back from violent institutions protecting their turf from
competitors.  And it seems to me that the potential push-back is what
keeps people glued to their sofas watching stage managed political
events on TV, rather than turning out to create political events of
their own in real life.

I'm not quite that stupid.
Only a sucker deliberately engages in "eyeball-to-eyeball combat on
equal terms" in real life.  There is no such thing as a fair fight,
because the only reason to fight is to shut a violent aggressor down.
 If it's a fight, fairness is already off the table.  Teaching people
to confuse fighting with a game or contest is a psychological weapon
used by ruthless, vicious "winners" to create weak minded, self
defeating losers and keep them in their place.  Bullies and losers
demand that people "fight fair."  I can't afford to care very much
about people who insist on proving themselves by "fighting fair."
In a real fight the only rule is to end it by the fastest, safest
means available.  Those who insist on proving themselves the better
man have a name, we call them cannon fodder.  Winners create and
exploit every possible advantage:  They lie, cheat, take every
advantage and the fewest risks possible while giving their adversaries
no chance at all.  Fighting is an ugly business, a grim necessity to
be avoided when possible.  There is nothing glamorous or heroic about
it and nothing to brag about afterward.
On the subject of "people working towards individual goals; each taking
a small chip out of the establishment," I understand that's a popular
idea.  I believe that "chip" is usually a paycheck.  But in politics
loners are by definition losers.  Popular fiction in the Rebel As You
Are Told genre would, of course, disagree with this assessment - did
someone mention media conspiracies earlier?
A plan to destroy the Leviathans of society the same way krill destroy
whales is no plan at all - because krill can't destroy whales, except
by dying off en masse and starving the whales.  Check your geophysics
- - that plan is already underway, literally /and/ figuratively,
courtesy of the Industrial Revolution.  The whole point of radical
politics is to change that plan as fast as possible.
Individual, uncoordinated acts of sabotage and non-cooperation can not
defeat a criminal gang that owns and controls a neighborhood.  It can
only weaken the gang, which results in a stronger, more predatory gang
moving in.  Kicking a gang to the curb takes an organized, united
front of uncompromising resistance:  In short, the regular folks in
that neighborhood need a gang of their own.
In today's domestic political warfare battle space, the effectiveness
of organizations opposing State and Corporate agendas are determined
by four factors:
Relevance - how much do how many people already WANT to obtain the
result the organization aims for?
Agility - how fast can you stand up an organization, and capitalize on
rapidly shifting opportunities?
Cohesion - resistance to division, sabotage and hijacking in the
organizational and network battle space.
Scalability - how fast can your organization propagate clones of
itself across existing communities?
When these four factors are present, Shit Happens.  They all require
voluntary cooperation, a.k.a. organization, and the relevant skill
sets and base of experience don't just happen by themselves.
Propagating the tools and experience necessary for political action is
a unifying theme and larger purpose of issue-oriented activism.  To
paraphrase George Carlin, "It's a big club and they want you in it."

Maybe we can start with the "Ark Angel" part:  Did the original

meaning of the word "ark" and did they use that word to designate the
functional role of certain angels?
In early modern English, an "archagel" would be a senior angel in
command of an entire class of angels, including armies of angels
("angelic hosts") and vast angelic choirs whose primary mission was to
sing hymns of praise to the IHVH.
Calling Gabriel or any other angel an "Ark Angel" and spinning a

of childish ignorance, compounded by the authors' failure to take the
slightest interest in the sources of the mythology they are ripping
off.  So the "Ark Angel" narrative identifies itself on contact as
ignorant bullshit targeting and illiterate and/or mentally impaired
The truth, if you can handle it:  The Earth is hollow, inhabited by
abandoned robots left behind by its former owners, the "Abandondero"
or "Deros" for short.  The Deros were instrumental in the rise of the
Third Reich through their malevolent use of remote mind control
technology.  Nazi expeditions to Antarctica, prompted by the Deros
themselves, made contact with these malevolent creatures and an
alliance followed.  Since the war, a subsurface colony established by
the Nazis has been working with the Deros to build an industrial base
sufficient to conquer the surface.  Recent spikes in reported
"paranormal" and "unexplained" phenomena worldwide indicate deployment
and testing of advanced Dero technology at a scale never before seen,
indicating that this invasion is imminent.
So-called flying saucers were an early product of the Nazi/Dero
alliance, merging human and alien technologies.  According to numerous
declassified military UFO reports from around the world, the Deros'
expertise in manipulating projected energy gave them the ability to
selectively neutralize selected electronic systems in aircraft in
flight, and to shut down ICBM launch facilities on demand, by the
mid-1960s.  Today, their technology has advanced far beyond that early
stage, giving the Nazi/Dero alliance the power to take control of
"our" world more or less at will; the most significant unanswered
question is, what are they waiting for?
An executive summary of what is known about the Deros, and a survey of

Hash: SHA1
Individuals can be honest, in a context where a mutual trust
relationship based on common material interests enables them to be
honest.  The weaker this bond of trust motivated by practical self
interest is, the less honesty is rewarded, and the more it is actively
punished when the information presented is unfavorable to the
interests of individual respondents.  Of course, there will be
exceptions to any rule:  Some idealists habitually tell the truth as
they see it with little regard for the consequences; some neurotics
will only tell the truth when they can't think of a better lie.
Organizations and institutions can not be honest, at least not for
long, because the persons who receive the most material compensation
through their participation in the organization or institution have a
personal interest in maintaining their dominant positions, inevitably
at the expense of other participants in the enterprise.  Growing the
power and influence of particular departments and the organization as
a whole, at the expense of other departments and organizations,
increases the personal compensation of members of those departments
and organizations.  So, both internal and external conflicts of
interest erode or negate trust relationships and the value of honesty
within and between formally organized enterprises.
Honesty's cousin, factual accuracy, is degraded or eliminated within
hierarchal organizations.  Hagbard's Law states that "communication is
only possible between equals."  When information is reported up a
chain of command, it is altered at every step by the reporters'
efforts to curry favor and/or avoid punishment.  A recent de facto
revolt by 50 intelligence analysts at CENTCOM, complaining that their
work product was being altered in transit to comply with the political
agendas, indicates that this mechanism is at work even in
organizations whose sole function is "accurately reporting information."
Mechanisms for transparency, accountability to third parties, and
flattening chains of command can to some extent mitigate the inherent
problems degrading honesty and information in organizations, but the
same mechanisms these strategies seek to correct are also present in
the mitigation processes themselves:
* Transparency requires reporting, and reporting requirements always
prompt the reporters to twist or discard information as necessary to
advance their interests, curry favor and/or avoid punishment.
* Third party monitors have their own agendas and organizational
drivers; as a classic example, the Internal Affairs activities of
police departments normally work to shield corrupt officers and
activities from accountability, except when taking sides in factional
power struggles affecting the whole organization.
* Organizations with horizontal command structures develop informal
cliques working off the record when and as necessary to influence the
organization's decision making and operational processes for their own
advantage.  This is done "for the good of the organization" as defined
by its ability to reward them for their participation.
Pontius Pilate famously asked, "What is truth?"  That was not so much
a question as a ironic statement:  In the Imperial Governor's house,
truth is whatever he says, because he has said it.  This provides us
with a working definition of what it means to speak "with authority."
The New York Times and its organizational sponsors manufacture truth
by speaking with authority.  A long running propaganda meme calls the
NYT a "newspaper of record."  What they publish is true because they
have published it, on behalf of State and Corporate powers with the
authority to enforce their collective will by any means necessary to
assure their continued dominance.
When the Times formally commits to "report America to the world
honestly," that only reaffirms their mission of publishing effective
propaganda in the interest of the American ruling class and their
various State and Corporate administrative organizations.  Some
conflicts among the ruling class will be reflected in that reporting,
and some factual information will make it through the many layers of
filters.  "Flat fact" will occasionally be published as loss-leader
material to maintain an illusion of impartiality, and some accurate
information will be exposed because the same mechanisms that degrade
competency within any organization degrade the quality of the NYT's
propaganda efforts.
But as a source of politically relevant general information, the New
York Times can best be approached as a hostile witness, if not a
downright vicious one:  If you want to know what your rulers want you
to believe in and care about, subscribe the New York Times.

Meh.  I prefer Trump by a /small/ margin; better chaos and gridlock in
DC than a massive, well coordinated murder machine IMO.  I'm
sentimental:  I hate to see millions of people slaughtered so a
handful of billionaires can keep growing their wealth & power right up
to the collapse of our present civilization.  In the case of Trump vs.
Clinton, better to roll the dice than accept a status quo that assures
the highest obtainable body count.
But I don't see a Yuge victory for the humans here, only a new set of
problems that /may/ be more tractable than those presented by Clinton.
I was rather shocked by the election results, because I have kept an
eye on developments in election rigging over the years.  Given the
aggregate power of entrenched interests sponsoring Clinton and the
scale of the cash flows that Trump's election have placed in jeopardy,
I did not expect a Trump win to be permitted.  Maybe someday we will
find out what happened behind the scenes - and whether the FBI
director's strange behavior had anything to do with it.

As with most elegant solutions to real world problems, the sticking
point with AP is implementation.  It requires anonymous payment
protocols that are themselves "bullet proof", and would have to
weather counter-attacks by a ruling class whose financial resources
and ability to affect major infrastructure changes are astronomically
higher than common sense would suggest.  Bounties for killing the
operators of an AP system, offered through more old fashioned means,
would be extraordinarily high - requiring bullet proof anonymity in
the presence of uber-motivated adversaries with global network

potential targets to take proportional defensive measures, which "at

Right you are:  Everyone from Mao Tse Tung to the authors of current
U.S. Army counter-insurgency manuals agrees, an armed uprising needs a
succeed.  That network has to be built, and it has to offer its
participants "real hope" of a better way of running things, before a
shooting war can succeed.
Gene Sharp's description of the American Revolution provides an
excellent example:  In brief, Sharp contends that the war was largely
a matter of the Crown attempting to take its colonies back over from
their residents, who had negated most Crown authority through large
scale non-cooperation and the development of parallel institutions
rendering the Crown's administration obsolete.
So-called revolutions that start with gunfire, end in Fascist police

"succeed" that's normally due to backing by hostile foreign powers.

It sounds like you believe critics of today's economic power structure
are opposed to anyone getting rich.  This belief is systematically
indoctrinated in Libertarian propaganda, borrowed from anti-Communist
propaganda from days gone by.  The meme in question is keyed to create
maximum animosity because after all, every Libertarian who's worth a
shit aspires to become "wealthy."  By some piss-ant peasant standard
of wealth, of course.  If you want to turn a few million  a year

Sorry, I wasn't talking about Government, I was talking about the
private sector, a.k.a. economic ruling class.  Deception and economic
coercion are their primary tools.  Courts and cops are necessary to
the survival of their enterprises, but may occasionally restrain some
of them from "irresponsible" abuses of power.
That's why total deregulation of everything and reduction of rule of
law to civil cases is a prime Libertarian platform plank:  The
government serves our rulers well, but under present conditions it
would serve them better if it was less protective of the health of the
workforce and more engaged in putting down civil uprisings caused by
those abuses of power.
The traditional Far Right shares the Libertarian deregulation agenda,
and is making slow but steady progress implementing it.  Libertarian
contributions to propaganda on this topic are more than welcome;
that's one of the reasons the Party exists.
Progress has been slow because a large faction within our ruling class
believes maintaining a stable, productive workforce, keeping up morale
in the managerial class, and preventing major civil uprisings is
better for business than a "reign of terror" approach.  Nonetheless,
the power players who like "stable" markets are aging out, a new
generation that thrives on chaos is rising, and the parable of the
boiling frog describes the present situation of "regular folks" who
just want to be left alone to tend their vinyards:  Jump out or die.
There's a significant trend among our Millinials toward jumping out,
and if they are not provided with a safety net by established economic
institutions they will do just that.  No such safety nets are visible
now, nor any signs that they are under construction.
When steam engine time comes, people railroad.  We are getting there

Nope.  Express and explicit.  Libertarian propagandists sell their
propositions with abstract arguments grounded in false assumptions
supported by cognitive biases.  This is consistent across their

Under the jurisdiction of State institutions created for the benefit
of the very rich, anything they agree among themselves to permit is
"perfectly legal."  That includes running a rigged house game
supported by massive deception and economic coercion, and assuring
that theirs are the only games in town.
Libertarian ideology relies heavily on false context.  When people
hear "personal property" the think "physical objects under my control,
and the fruits of my personal labors."  This context is not comparable
to possession and trading of legal instruments defining ownership over
geographically dispersed industries, vast tracts of land, anticipated
profits from as yet unexploited resources, etc., in locations occupied
and facilities operated by what the commies call "wage slaves."
In the U.S., most people's personal property is actually a collection
of legal instruments specifying the rent they pay on a finance
company's car, a mortage company's house, etc.  Low wages plus
expensive Real Estate creates forced dependency on land lords for the
majority of Americans.
How?  By litigating against offenders whose ability to pay attorneys,
expert witnesses, etc. exceeds one's own by five or more orders of
magnitude?  By lobbying for changes in the law, in competition with
these same offenders, their massive financial resources, and their
long standing alliances with dominant political and Deep State factions?
Ah so:  Taxation is payment for services rendered when that supports a
Libertarian argument, otherwise not.  :D
I blame full saturation propaganda operations paid for by the ruling
class who also happen to own the "mainstream media," working hand in
hand with State propaganda assets and of course, the organized efforts
of our DemoPublican Party which itself represents the interests of our
ruling class.  Political controversies in the mainstream occasionally
reflecting differences of opinion among dominant factions with regard
to whose commercial interests should be favored at the expense of
other commercial interests; but maintaining the integrity of ruling
class control and expanding same is a goal shared by the DemoPublican
Party as a whole, as is locking out participation by competing Parties.
Libertarian ideology relies heavily on cognitive bias and false
assumptions.  The argument presented above is persuasive - as long as
a "normative" distribution of assets and incomes is assumed.  But in
reality, a fraction of 1% of the population dominates in both income
and assets.  The models presented above does not have sufficient
resolution to accurately describe the subject matter addressed.
Check this high resolution model out:
Note also that "income tax" applies to personal income, not capital
gains.  Personal income as understood by John and Jane Q. Public is
only a small fraction of what members of our ruling class "make" in
the course of a successful year.
Libertarians see absolutely nothing wrong with the very rich "gaming
the system" for personal advantage in every way that having a lot of
money to spend makes possible.  This leaves everyone else on the
losing end of every deal that was supposed to be "fair and honest"
under rule of law.  Perhaps this explains why the Libertarian Party
was co-opted by well funded right wing extremists around the turn of
the century and has been working under their direction ever since.
What may have been a disruptive influence on national politics is now
only a propaganda platform, pushing political discourse to the Right
as far as it is able.  If you are too smart for the RNC, the
Libertarians have a better idea - and the same domestic economic
agenda, both functional and fictional.
I guess your definition of Libertarian embraces both NeoLiberal and
NeoConservative agendas and policies.  That makes sense, as the
synthesis of NeoLiberal and NeoConservative policy is Fascism - the
foundation of Libertarian economic ideology.
Europe and Japan became industrial powerhouses in the 1950s due to the
aging industrial infrastructure destroyed in WWII being replaced with
the latest and best facilities and equipment, with assistance from the
Marshall Plan.  Military and economic alliances including NATO and the
Trilateral Commission participants were firmed up at that time, as
were strong trans-national alliances among the ruling classes of the
nations involved.
The collapse of the manufacturing sector in the United States was
engineered by that alliance, by removing "protectionist" regulatory
and tax policies to permit dumping on U.S. markets.  The principal
objective was to break U.S. labor unions.  Exploitation of the
resulting political power vacuum to facilitate a hard "Right turn" in
U.S. domestic policy was also a major goal.  This program was
successful, and income inequality began growing exponentially as the
U.S. ruling class began looting the assets of the U.S. middle class, a
process that is still ongoing today.
The new manufacturing bases in Europe /created/ new middle class
income brackets in those nations.  Looting of the asset base this
post-WWII middle class started a couple of decades ago.  I hear it's
going really well, and Fascism is now on the rise in Europe.
The world has changed, not for the worse but for the worst:  The
enlightened stewardship of our economic ruling class, unchecked by any
meaningful feedback from those ruled over, has driven exponential
growth of toxic and resource-depleting industrialism worldwide.  We
are now well past the point of no return and a global economic and
population crash can not be avoided.  Our rulers are well aware of
this, and their response to date has not included any but token
efforts at mitigation, far more than counterbalanced by a mad dash to
make more money faster and concentrate it into fewer hands before the
game ends.  The rulers of today's world fully intend to rule the
post-collapse world unchallenged, and for all time.
If this means making the population crash happen sooner, massively
increasing the early body count and destroying the means for recovery
in presently habitable regions, so be it:  From a Libertarian
ideological stance, one might say that the world is their property and
they have a natural right to do with it as they please.  If you don't
like it, sue them.  In their Courts, before Judges who appointed by
their club.

Taxes are payment for services rendered.  In the United States, 500
billionaires presently own about 1/2 of the capital assets; to retain
control of those assets they need a legal system that defines their
rights of ownership and enforces them, civil Courts to arbitrate their
internal disputes and legitimize abuses of power against outsiders,
civil infrastructure built and maintained at public expense to support
the productivity of their capital assets, and a propaganda regimen to
persuade the rest of us that this is all for the best.  The sovereign
State is /their/ collectivist system, taxing the poor to subsidize the
rich with all of the above services.  Taxes even support cash payments
and no-interest loans to the very rich, where and as bailing out one
corporation benefits enough of the others to create a consensus to do
that - at public expense.
I was wondering when someone would mention this.  Rich people pay a
very small fraction of the taxes they whine about and want to see
abolished; instead they pay accountants and attorneys to advise them
on how to avoid taxation.  Some few billionaires do pay enough taxes
that the numbers look impressive to illiterate peasants, for
propaganda purposes.  I recall there was a bit of a flap in the press
at the turn of the century when some ungrateful assholes publicized
the fact that Microsoft Inc. paid no corporate income tax; I believe
this was "fixed" by arranging for token payments thereafter.
Currency inflation is also a tax on the poor for the benefit of the
rich.  The lower classes store much of their wealth in the form of
dollars that diminish in value, while the ruling class stores its
wealth in instruments denoting ownership of physical assets whose
value is not affected by currency inflation.  Inflation also depresses
wages, as the same "dollar amount" progressively buys less and less.
The U.S. minimum wage from 1968, adjusted for inflation, would be
$24.00/hr today.
Political activists are presently running a "Fight For Fifteen"
campaign in the U.S., asking for a de facto 40% pay cut relative to
1968's more or less "living" minimum wage.  How fucked up is that?
Affluence requires collectivism, in the form of social and economic
class loyalty; join the united front in support of employment and wage
discrimination or you are out in the cold.  Getting a "really good
job" is a pay to play proposition.
It is possible for independent entrepreneurs to "work around" class
barriers; wildcat free enterprise works, for the tiny minority whose
bright ideas and hard work do pay off.  But when capitalist
enterprises notice something chewing on the edge of their markets they
crush it, as a matter of routine business practice.  Counter examples
can be found, but you will need a magnifying glass and tweezers.
Libertarian and other alt-Right propaganda teaches us that Capitalism
and Free Enterprise are the same thing, but in the real world they are
natural enemies and when they collide, Capitalism always wins.
Work will make you free?  Sure it will.  The spreading red stain on
the U.S. political map happens to exactly match maps showing the
geographic distribution of poverty, which brings with it both
ignorance and anger - a fertile field for Fascist indoctrination.  The
less intelligent in that audience self-select KKK flavored messaging,
the more intelligent gravitate toward Libertarian bullshit.  Both
flavors of alt-Right propaganda assert that their audiences are
inherently superior to other people, that that if certain scapegoats
were neutralized that audience would "regain all they have lost, and
more."  Just by coincidence, the ruling class - our billionaires - are
never named as scapegoats, but instead are portrayed as fellow victims
of an imaginary conspiracy of the weak and inferior.
Changing out "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fuhrer" for Ein Volk, Ein
Reich, Ayn Rand does not convert Fascism to Freedom, unless the
freedom in question is that of the very rich to do whatever they want,
restrained only by other factions within their same class, at everyone
else's expense.  In that case, a little rebranding to make Fascism
more palatable to a U.S. market might be all it takes to get 360+
million peasants "off the backs" of those 500 billionaires who own 1/2
the capital assets in the U.S.
By definition, organization and united action is political power.  If
you want the U.S. ruling class and its government off YOUR back, the
fact that your fellow peasants outnumber your aristocratic overlords
by more than a half million to one is the key to success:  Your rulers
have effectively unlimited financial assets and control of the State
on their side, you have - or  might be able to get - the power of
massive numbers of boots on the ground on your side.  Collectivism is
the key to power:  The very rich do it, cooperating to assure that
nothing threatens their established collective power.  Our rulers'
propaganda contractors have been busy for generations teaching the
rest of us that Collectivism is the Ultimate Evil; they are paid to
pump out this message because collectivism is the only thing that can
challenge the power of a well entrenched ruling class.
The cure for Libertarianism is Populism.  If you don't know what that
is, there are a few clues here, but be forewarned:  It requires
getting up off your ass and actually doing things, not just bitching
about how stupid those other people are.

Three missing elements in this (very useful) summary:
First, the rise of the Third Reich happened while Germany was in
economic ruins due to the Great Depression and Treaty of Versailles,
literally on the brink of mass starvation.  The people were desperate
and the NSDAP offered a simple explanation (Jews and Communists did
it) and a simple solution (get rid of the Jews and Communists).  Under
these conditions the Nazis were able to organize a national militia,
the SA (Sturmabteilung a.k.a. Brown Shirts) and employ terrorist
tactics to help the German people vote correctly.
Second, Germany had a very strong culture of obedience to authority, a
moral imperative synonymous with "honor."  This mind set was dominant
throughout the European sphere of influence in the 19th century, and
although it was in decline (i.e. the much lamented decadence of the
"yellow nineties" and outbreaks of anarchism in the early 20th
century) it remained firmly in place there:  The older Germans I met
as a child were very much "Old World" people, and even as a child I
could see that clearly.
Third, Herr Hitler & Co. kept their key campaign promises:  They did
in fact restore Germany's economy and turned the country (back) into
an industrial powerhouse.  This was accomplished by implementing many
reforms borrowed from Roosevelt's New Deal, and with the kindly
assistance of capital provided by U.S. industrialists who heartily
approved of the Nazis' political philosophy and economic policies.
The Nazis earned the gratitude - and compliance - of the German people.
Hitler was a passionate nationalist; Trump is a vulgar opportunist.
Once in power, Hitler united his nation and did, in fact, make it
great again - at least in terms of economic prosperity and industrial
production.  Trump has already mobilized the already divided American
people into warring factions:  Our natural born Fascists are out of
the closet, the political Left is snarling and screeching while its
leadership digs in for four years of mortal combat, and "moderates" of
all stripes - a sleeping demographic giant - are looking for something
they can actually DO about this train wreck for the first time in
generations.  The Internet has broken the monopoly of Big Capital over
the content mass communications, so the Nazi's famous full spectrum
domestic propaganda regimen can not be duplicated here and now.
Although I would much rather have seen Sanders in the White House,
attempting to implement an updated New Deal solution to the ongoing
collapse of the U.S. economy, a Democratic Party under the literal
control of Clinton and her network stopped Sanders by every means
necessary, and handed the White House to Donald Trump.  So now we get
to see a radical solution to the various crises presently facing the
United States and the world:  Four years of open warfare between the
American Right Fringe and Everyone Else.
Our economic power brokers are already lining up behind Trump, leaving
"boots on the ground" in the form of mass popular movements as his
opponents' only viable response.  We have been taught all our lives
that this means armed conflict, because that's an option our rulers
are very well prepared to control and use to their own advantage.  But
economic warfare through strikes, occupations and mass non-cooperation
are powerful weapons that hit a ruling class hard where it counts - in
their balance sheets and quarterly reports.  Mass movements using
nonviolent strategies and tactics can move political mountains - or
failing this, the struggle to move those mountains builds the
committed support networks that must exist for a last resort armed
insurgency to succeed.

Not me, and I think it's not likely that such a study will turn up any
time soon.  A study analyzing the impact of "fake news" would have to
present a defensible thesis based on begging the question, as "fake
news" is a buzzword promoted by a propaganda campaign.
As an example of actually fake news, I would cite the Big Lie that
Russia "interfered with" the election.  Numerous unsourced allegations
presented as straight news grew up around one press release from one
Department of Homeland Security dated October 7, 2016, asserting that
Russia interfered with the Presidential election.
Note that this was a press release, a.k.a. propaganda placement.  Its
content is attributed to the USIC (United States Intelligence
Community).  As there is no such agency or department, this
speculative assertion can not be attributed to any formal process or
responsible party, which confirms its status as fake news:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like
DCLeaks .com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with
the US election process."
No causal link is presented connecting Russian "methods and
motivations" with disclosures "intended to interfere with the US
election process."  The statement presents an example of transfer, a
widely recognized classic propaganda technique.
Subsequent stories asserting that the CIA has confirmed this
speculation follow this template:  A reporter says an anonymous source
claimed an unnamed senior intelligence official told them that
unspecified secret information confirms Russian involvement in
releasing incriminating DNC e-mails to Wikileaks.
The Obama Administration propaganda placement blaming the leak on
Russia was a component of a larger campaign to demonize Trump by
depicting his stated willingness to negotiate with Russia as proof of
collaboration with a foreign enemy.  Post-election, it became the
rarely-cited but always referenced cornerstone of a separate campaign
asserting that the election was stolen by Russia and Trump.
The content of the leaked documents this camapign references indicates
that Clinton's DNC conspired to steal the primary from Sanders.  News
stories about "Russia interfering" never deny that the leaked
documents are authentic, because drawing any attention to their
content would defeat the diversionary purpose of the entire Big Lie
campaign:  Blame Russia, not the DNC, for handing Trump the Presidency.
The original DHS propaganda placement is the best known and most often
repeated Big Lie of the election.  But, even after showing that it
presents an example of "fake news" - a very defensible proposition -
how can an academic develop persuasive evidence that this fake news
influenced the outcome of the Presidential election?

The primary source for claims that Russia "interfered with" the U.S.
Presidential race is a pre-election press release from the Obama
Administration's Department of Homeland Security.  Note that this was
a press release, a.k.a. propaganda placement, not an intelligence work
product created under an audited process by an accountable activity.
This is the sum total of "evidence" presented, and it is self
evidently pure speculation:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like
DCLeaks .com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with

All present claims that the CIA has confirmed this speculation follow
this template:  A reporter said an anonymous source claimed an unnamed
senior intelligence official told them that unspecified secret
information confirms Russian involvement in releasing incriminating
DNC e-mails to Wikileaks.
Before the general election, the claim of Russian State interference
with the Presidential election was only one of many talking points
used by the DNC:  A component of the effort to demonize Trump by
turning his statements expressing a willingness to negotiate with
Russia into a confession that he was collaborating with a foreign enemy.
Since the election, the assertion that Russia "rigged" the election
has been turned into a full scale Big Lie propaganda campaign led by
media outlets affiliated with the Democratic National Committee.  No
effort or expense has been spared in saturating U.S. mass media with
claims that Russia rigged the Presidential election, backed by no
evidence of any kind.  In social media venues frequented by Democratic
Party loyalists, something approaching lynch mob hysteria has emerged,
including calls to negate the election results by any means necessary
in order to protect "Democratic process."
As partisan misdirection from the Obama Administration this circus act
is brilliant:  Earlier I caught myself ignoring the fact that nobody
denies the content of the leaked documents is factual, which means
(among other things) that Hillary stole the nomination.
Meanwhile, back in the real world, investigative reporter Greg Palast
has published real evidence of good old fashioned American election
rigging.  Spoiler:  Exit polls in States under Republican
Administrations show results opposite the official counts, and follow
up indicates this was in at least some cases the result of
demographically targeted ballot rejection.
Funny thing:  Nobody with the necessary budget and influence is making
a propaganda effort to promote this factual election rigging narrative.

From the "fun facts" file:
To date, no evidence in support of the assertion that Russia
"interfered" in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election has been
presented:  Only unsupported claims - and, to date, the CIA has had
nothing to say about it.
The only source for this widespread belief is an October, 2016 press
release from the Department of Homeland Security press office.  Note
that this was not an intelligence work product or a communication with
any U.S. or State agency or other responsible party.  It was a
partisan Obama Administration propaganda placement intended to
influence public opinion:  A component of the effort to demonize Trump
by turning his statements expressing a willingness to negotiate with
Russia into a confession that he was collaborating with a foreign enemy.
All the stories blaming Russia for the release of "hacked" e-mail
content purporting to show criminal activities by Hillary Clinton and
her DNC associates are based on this single statement from the DHS
press release, which is self evidently pure speculation:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like
DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with
the US election process."
No claim of "secret evidence" in support of this speculation is made
in the press release, nor has any evidence supporting this speculation
appeared since that time.
Since the election, the assertion that Russia "rigged" the election
has been turned into a full scale Big Lie propaganda campaign by media
outlets affiliated with the Democratic National Committee.  Headline
stories across numerous media outlets agree, the CIA says Russia Did
It.  Every "new" story reports that an anonymous source says that an
unnamed senior intelligence official told them that secret information
proves Russian involvement.

That's not a hypothetical:  It's a misperception engineered by
propaganda.  Multi-million dollar budgets are devoted to lining up as
much support as possible for the West's economically motivated
conquest of territory that happens to have Musilims walking around on
it, and exploiting racism and xenophobia is a tried and true winning
The illusion that Christians hate Muslims is an example of the
Bandwagon approach:  Lists of classic propaganda techniques always
include Bandwagon, and describe it as messaging that proves
"everybody's doing it," the it being whatever the promoter was hired
to sell.  Brining people on board is the primary objective, but
Bandwagon's includes a secondary impact when the same messaging that
seeks to unite and motivate one audience serves to turn other
audiences against them.  This greatly enhances the insular group
identities of all affected demographics, and in a political context
prepares them for mobilization against each other.
In our example, the racist Islamophobia attributed to "almost every
christian in the industrialized world" is an artifact of Bandwagon
propaganda targeting the  minority of self identifying Christians who
happen to express strong xenophobic and racist traits as native
personality features, independent of their religious beliefs.  This
minority is large enough to be dangerous if united and mobilized -
which is why extensive, expensive efforts are underway to capture and
mobilize them.
As a veteran and member in good standing of Full Gospel, Catholic,
Gnostic and Quaker faith communities, I can assure one and all that
very few of the racist xenophobes mentioned above are observant
Christians, even by the most superficial standards of performance.
The Christian mainstream recognizes and opposes the systematic
exploitation and abuse of their brand, but contrary to indoctrinated
popular belief, does not have the financial and media resources to
successfully challenge that agenda in the public arena.
I would describe the problem Christians (a.k.a. target demograhic) as
people with very legitimate grievances against the real world they
live in from day to day.  They have been systematically denied
educational resources, locked out of living wage employment, and
politically disenfranchised.  Because of these realities, they are
also strongly affected by what Alvin Toffler called "future shock,"
exceptionally vulnerable to the Good Old Days propaganda technique.
The same people who imposed poverty on their communities exploit the
resulting vulnerabilities by presenting outsiders as scapegoats, and
mobilizing them to demand that their captors be given the power and
authority to "put the world to rights," a.k.a. Make America Great
Again on their behalf.
What can we do about the resulting mess?  I'm an advocate for
outreach; get the "real Christians" up on their feet and down to the
street, not to stand against but with their wounded co-religionists.
The sidewalk talk, soap box speeches and formal sermons practically
write themselves and win at an easy walk.  Where and as the necessary
effort is made, all the uncommitted are belong to us.

Optimum solutions to "the end of privacy" necessarily include
embracing the recording and archiving of our lives as the normal

The Grugq presents operational security tips for "hacktivists," much
of which is also very applicable to less illegal forms of dissident

talking points about the published DNC e-mail: "The releases were
highly damaging to Clinton, and US intelligence officials now believe
they were hacked by Russia and passed to WikiLeaks to boost Trumpâs
bid for the White House."  Said what accountable person, when, where
and to whom?

the USIC, an acronym for United States Intelligence Community.  No
such agency exists, so it is not possible for it to have an official
spokesperson, except maybe the President - their ultimate boss, at
least on paper.
That said, the Assange quotes in the article sound exactly like Mendax

strength force of veterans in defense of the Standing Rock action:

identified with emotional appeals wired into one or the other flavor

Standing Rock was a transformational battle in that, although the

everyone who was paying any real attention knows it morphed into an
act of economic warfare, backed by battalion strength mobile infantry.
By modern uber-mechanized warfare standards, that was four battalions

It seems to me that AP has not been implemented due to one deficit:
We have no means of implementing AP with adequate safeguards to
protect the operators and participants from the combined resources of
military and law enforcement agencies from numerous jurisdictions
AP may be "perfectly legal" for every participant except the prize
winners, but in the view of a targeted ruling class and its servants,
it is perfectly legal to kill the operators on discovery as long as
they do not get caught doing so.  If they do get caught, they can
simply change the laws.  Their propaganda capabilities would assure
broad public approval of any such changes.
AP is a novel means of waging class warfare, but if and when it gets
implemented the "enemies of the people" will not surrender or sit
quietly waiting to die, constrained by rule of law from striking back
with every means available to them.  As these means include already
established surveillance and manipulation capabilities spanning the
networks AP communications must hide in to be successful, early
implementations of AP would trigger an arms race.  Maybe the AP side
can win, but the lessons learned along the way to that victory would
be paid for in the blood of failed operators.  So far no one has shown
up with the necessary technical capabilities and confidence to take
the risk and pay the price.
A fully distributed network protocol for AP, with no single or
higher-value points of failure, clever enough to offer a credible (if
false) promise of security to early adopters, might someday get off
the ground.  But given that the global industrial economy will most
likely collapse first and take most of today's ruling class down with
it, I think it makes more sense to wait for the laws of physics to do
the job.
The more hard-headed anarchistic technologists we have when that
happens, the sooner a world (more) worth living in can replace the one
we have.  Since trying to make AP work in today's real would motivate
today's ruling class to thin that particular herd, I would not
encourage them to implement AP... just yet.

just saw (excuse me, "witnessed") but also why the instant global
mechanical failure of the towers happened, to the swift and complete

everything about the 911 narrative points to deception and

estimate of what happened leaves LOTS of room for uncertainties, and
the only map of the world affected is my very own.

@_subject: Schneier on Russian Hacking - deconstructed 
To date I have seen many assertions, but nothing resembling evidence, in
support of the allegation that Russia "hacked" the DNC and released
damaging (but never disclaimed) DNC documents in an effort to influence
the Presidential election.
I believe the Bruce must have meant to say something to the effect that
"The constellation of evidence attributing the attacks against the DNC,
if any, has not been disclosed to the public."
Or was he asserting that he has been read into the programs that
developed this evidence, and shown relevant documentation?
Excuse me?  Obama decided to make the accusation public in a press
release, a.k.a. propaganda placement dated October 7, 2016. Its content
was attributed to the "USIC" by the Department of Homeland Security.
This press release was distributed with clear intent to influence the
election.  Read it here:
The key allegation:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks
.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent
with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These
thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election
In keeping with propaganda best practices, this statement does not
actually accuse Russia of anything - not if you read it closely and
interpret it according to strict rules of grammar.  The source of the
statement is not identified:  There is no such agency as the United
States Intelligence Community (USIC per the press release), so it can
not be attributed to any responsible authority or formal reporting
process.  This is the safest way to tell a Big Lie.  The preceding
sentence is not a statement by me that it WAS a Big Lie - so if I get
dragged into Court for saying so, my hands are clean.
The inflammatory pre-election press release from the Obama
Administration's Department of Homeland Security was followed up by
numerous placements in the U.S. press, a constellation of assertions
consistent this template:
A reporter says an anonymous source claimed an unnamed senior
intelligence official told them that unspecified secret information
confirms Russian involvement in releasing incriminating DNC e-mails to
The timing, context and follow-on promotion of the DHS press release
blaming the leak on Russia indicate it was a component of a larger
campaign by the DNC on behalf of the Clinton campaign, intended to
demonize Trump by depicting his stated willingness to negotiate with
Russia as proof of collaboration with a foreign enemy.
Post-election, the DHS press release became the rarely-cited but always
referenced cornerstone of a separate campaign asserting that the
election was stolen by Russia and Trump.  This was the keynote of an
apparent attempt to persuade the Electors to install Hillary Clinton as
To the best of my knowledge - and I have been following this story
closely - no evidence of "Russian Hacking" has been presented to date.
We have been treated to a few code names of "hacking groups" allegedly
involved, and a couple of textbook diagrams of how hostile parties
penetrate network servers.  That is all.
If no evidence can be released due to legitimate concerns for protecting
sources and methods, and no substantial national security mission is
advanced by partisan accusations, it would be nice if the "USIC" would
stop exposing their super-secret capabilities to the world by asserting
what they knew and when they knew it.
Would these retaliations include, perhaps, the murder of the Russian
ambassador to Turkey, the downing of a Russian plane carrying an
irreplaceable cultural and diplomatic delegation to Syria, the rapid
deployment of a battalion strength U.S. armor force to the Russian
Federation border, and a missile attack on a Syrian airport by friendly
Israelis?  And if so, should we presume that all-around security expert
Bruce Schneier approve of these actions?
I could interpret the Obama Administration's 11th hour provocations
against Russia as an effort to create a massive foreign relations crisis
for the incoming Trump Administration, intended to overwhelm its
underqualified foreign policy contingent and deliver early control of
Trump Administration foreign policy to the U.S. intelligence
establishment and other Deep State actors.  Whether this might have been
a "wise" course to take, is a matter of opinion.  As would be the
legality of such a maneuver.
It may also be possible that the Obama Admninistration's pre-election
propaganda placement blaming the DNC leak on the Russian Federation
simply started a domino effect that ran out of control and nearly caused
World War III.
CNN?  I will not here repeat the propaganda slogan presently saturating
U.S. media, two words that malign the veracity of certain press outlets.
 But the shoe fits and Mr. Schneier will have a hard time taking it back
off.  That makes me sad.

Security regression paradox:  What's to prevent whoever might have
replaced the binary in the repo - or replaced it in transit to you -
from also rigging the source?  So you have to audit the source.  And
the compiler that makes the source useable might have already been
compromised, so audit its source and then... oops, compile the audited
compiler using a potentially compromised compiler on a potentially
compromised OS.
This problem is no reason to just give up, but it does transform the
security picture from a purely imaginary secure vs. insecure binary
state, to an ecosystem of context-dependent compromise solutions.
The costs of an "acceptable" security result depend on this question:
 What it is worth to an adversary to break your security model, vs.
how much is preventing compromise of that asset worth to you?  If an
adversary spends less to successfully attack an asset than they gain
by doing so, the adversary wins.  If you spend more to successfully
defend an asset than that asset is worth to you, you lose.
This context provides a rational basis for allocating resources to
security, but alas, it rules out absolute values or one size fits all
solutions:  Who are your potential adversaries, what motivates them,
what resources are available to them?  Who benefits from your security
strategy, and what are they willing / able to pay - in additional
work, constraints on their behavior, and cash money - to secure the
assets in question?  A security model that does not take these factors
into accounts is a snake oil security model, regardless of the quality
of the tools used.

@_subject: Re: Public Dissentiment 
Hash: SHA1
I do see a major problem with public perception of science, driven by
social trends in academia and the self-promotion interests of media
personalities presented to the public as the "voice of Science."  I
call it the Scientician faith:  Just change out a Bishop's crook and
mitre for a PhD and lab coat and viola, a High Priest.
In academia, a naive but paradoxically condescending brand of atheism
is the de facto State Religion.  At best, certain religions where
"liberal" political views hold sway may be tolerated as beneficial
exercises in applied social psychology (i.e. Unitarian, Quaker).  The
rest are lumped together as infantile, socially destructive delusions,
and disposed of with a handy set of strawman attacks against their
participants:  Sneering atheists always know /much/ more about the
motives and behavior of "religious" people than those people know
themselves, and never hesitate to fill them in.  In many instances it
is painfully obvious that atheism is a neurotic expression of a
repressed fear that God - the nasty one from fundamentalist fairy
tales - might exist.
The modern and correct replacement for naive religious belief is
Scientism, a faith whose adherents believe that science provides final
answers to all meaningful questions about life, the Universe "and
everything."  These believers would not know a falsifiable hypothesis
if it bit them in the ass, and can not distinguish a consensus model
from Holy Writ.  In their minds and lives, science is the final Voice
of Authority, completely and exactly filling the role the Church held
in the Dark and Middle Ages as final arbiter of Truth.  As a general
rule, only working scientists know that this is ridiculous - and I do
not include the "social sciences" in this grouping.
The Scientician faith has spread beyond academia, establishing itself
as a popular cult through media personalities presented as High
Priests of Scientism.  In the process, personalities who serve as the
public Voices of Science have become useful tools for propagandists
tasked to promote "scientific" industrial products and public policy.
 Astrophysicists are especially well suited to this role, as their job
is to explain "everything."  Carl Sagan, a brilliant entertainer but
3rd rate scientist whose only notable contribution to the literature
(signing off on a geophysical model of nuclear winter) lasted for just
a few months before being discarded by community consensus, set the
pattern.  Neil Tyson now fills his shoes, reaching an audience of tens
of millions with The Truth about various controversial issues in
geophysics, the life sciences and public health policy on behalf of
corporate sponsors.  In the public mind, an astrophysicist is an
expert on everything that exists.
This brings us to a real problem of much more than "academic" concern:
 The role of corporate sponsorship as a regulating factor in research,
publication and the evolution of consensus models in the sciences.
The propaganda activities of petrochemicals lobbies, for instance,
offer literal bounties for anyone with a PhD in any field related to
geophysics who will go on record with the opinion that global warming
is not real, and/or that human activity has nothing to do with it.
These same information warriors fund a cottage industry that creates
spurious "proofs" that the Earth is actually cooling, for use in media
campaigns.  This has so far been a losing battle, in that an
overwhelming consensus supports global warming - but creating "doubt
and dissent" is sufficient to defend de facto genocidal public policy.
On the immunology, toxicology and epidemiology fronts, however, we
have a very different outcome:  Any findings harmful to the commercial
interests of the multi-billion dollar PharmaChem research and
development industry are in the "publish and perish" category for
workers in these fields.  As an example, any layman who examines
public health statistics looking for the miracle working impact of
"life saving vaccines" over the last century will notice that there
was no such impact; but people who are paid to do so must pretend
otherwise.  A two year study falsifying the results of the most
frequently cited papers indicating that flu vaccines has a significant
impact on mortality was greeted by the Journal of the American Medical
Association with, âTo accept these results would be to say that the
Earth is flat!â  True story...
When genetic engineering first became possible in the early 1970s,
geneticists and microbiologists did not debate the safety of the
technology, so much as which containment technologies should be
mandated by law, to positively prevent the escape of its products from
the laboratory setting.  But when the first commercial products of
genetic engineering were developed, no less a can-do guy than Donald
Rumsfeld successfully lobbied the Bush I Administration to have
transgenics based factory farming declared to be in the National
Interest of the United States.  Today, studies indicating that key
components of this technology are endocrine disruptors, carcinogens,
and have acutely detrimental ecological side-effects are pointedly
ignored by academia.
Astrophysicists can assure us that transgenics based factory farming
is a "life saving" technology, but geneticists who talk about the
potential hazards of commercialized genetic engineering are not
welcome on the talk show circuit.
"Faith in science" is at best a grossly unreliable compass for those
who do not understand the methods and history of science, and the
impact of un- and anti-scientific influences on the practice of
science in the real world.  Those who do understand science know
better than to have "faith" in its methods and products, but do have
well justified confidence that the oldest and best established
consensus models in physics will "very very likely" continue to hold
up over time, in the physical contexts where they were originally
developed and tested.

On the domestic front, fascist States consolidate and expand the power
of a ruling elite through a propaganda regimen presenting an
existential conflict between the country's racial and ethnic "rightful

On the international front, fascist States wage aggressive wars to
further the commercial interests of their ruling elites, under the

to the State's racial and ethnic "rightful owners."

3/4 of the client nodes in the TOR network. Until proven otherwise -

Even if one makes the most pessimistic assumptions, TOR remains
useful. It will continue to punch through school, corporate and even
national network firewalls. TOR negates surveillance by network
service providers and makes users effectively invisible to
surveillance and profiling by corporate actors. TOR will continue to
reliably protect wireless connections at public venues from
eavesdropping or manipulation by J. Random Hacker. But TOR users who
have reason to believe that the NSA or another State actor would ever
actually do anything with information collected about their
TOR-cloaked activities, such as share it with a law enforcement agency

I recently watched Adam Curtis' latest documentary,
Hypernormalisation.  Being a long time fan of Curtis' work, I found
Hypernormalisation a little disconcerting.  Mainstream historians
often do very well at exposing the "important but neglected" details
of once-controversial political events.  But when their accounts
directly involve living persons in positions of power their standards
of evidence may take a holiday.  As an example, Overthrow:  America's
Century Of Regine Change by Stephen Kinzer stands out as a remarkably
complete and insightful work until it arrives at the first Bush
Administration.  From there, the author begins repeating the U.S.
propaganda line contradicting well documented, readily available
factual evidence.  It now appears that Adam Curtis has also found a
need to exercise discretion in truth-telling.
I may change my mind tomorrow.  Maybe there's something ironic or
Mobius-self-referential behind the narrative of Hypernormalisation
that I just don't get.  But right now I question the wisdom of Curtis
even starting this project, which accepts current propaganda
narratives, rejected by a consensus of independent journalists, as
plain facts.  This is largely accomplished by dancing around the
ground truth of key turning point events central to the narrative's
accounts of the present wars in Libya and Syria.
In a film whose message might be summed up as "civilization has gone
insane and no one knows what is real any more," gross misattribution
of the origins of the wars against Libya and Syria casts a long
shadow:  Had more factual views of the role of US/NATO powers in these
events been acknowledged, however briefly, that shadow would not be
quite so dark:  But as the presentation stands, it proves its own
point by hiding information essential to understanding reality,
depriving the audience of insights with regard to fact vs. fiction on
the world stage - a definition of insanity.
I don't expect Mr. Curtis to be a superhero or a martyr.  But I have
come to expect better work than Hypernormalisation from him.  Parts of
the show were really quite excellent.  But the more he built on the
central themes of the presentation, the more disjointed and dissonant
the narrative looked to me, until Curtis appeared to prove his own
point about the world going insane as the narrative itself went off
the rails and broke contact with reality.  I do not expect a Call To
Action at the end of a Curtis story, but an implicit statement that
our only option is to "just give up," reinforced by an object lesson
in same, is a call to action of its own sort.
I appreciate and recommend the whole Curtis canon of documentaries,
and my expectations for the future are not diminished:  I can easily
believe that in this case, the material Curtis was working with bit
back and he did the best he could to salvage a no-win situation.  So I
do suggest that readers who are not familiar with Adam Curtis check
out The Power Of Nightmares and/or The Century Of The Self before
viewing Hypernormalisation.

celebrity status as a political commentator?  Yeah right...
Not mentioned in the film, Mr. Greenwald's $250 million payout when he
sold rights to the documents he reportedly promised Snowden would all
be released to the public within ten days of breaking the first story.
To date, every result of the Snowden Saga has been beneficial to the
Security State.  The State has won every legal challenge resulting
from those releases, establishing its "right" to collect everything on
everyone, restrained only by its own technical capabilities.  As a
bonus, it has been established that the DCI can lie to Congress and
break into Congress members' computers with NO consequences of ANY
kind.  The great unwashed publick, already timid enough, is now on

The Snowden Saga looked hinky to me from the beginning.  My own guess
is that he was/is an unwitting agent, a malleable malcontent spotted
early by an Insider Threat program and picked from a field of
candidates to front for a limited hangout aimed at achieving all the

Hash: SHA1
I think that depends on the performance of the anonymous networking
tool in question.  Generally speaking, higher speed and capacity
equates to lower security.  High bandwidth, low latency connected
protocols present the worst case scenario; low bandwidth, high latency
unconnected protocols present the best case scenario.
As an example, providing "normal" http performance on an anonymous
overlay network (the TOR scenario) presents a huge attack surface.  An
adversary who can observe the majority of the physical network
infrastructure all at once can use traffic analysis to trace
connections from end to end; a lesser adversary could stand up enough
routing nodes to be the majority owner of the overlay network and both
passively observe and actively manipulate traffic to achieve the same
goals as a global observer at a tiny fraction of the cost. (VPN
connections from a cloud server farm to numerous remote hosts solves
the problem of running centrally controlling nodes that /appear/ to be
independently operated.)
At the opposite end of the scale, imagine a network of NNTP servers
that carry only PKI encrypted posts, distributing everything posted to
all users.  The users' local installations would try their owner's
keys against /all/ the messages, writing those that decrypt to an
inbox folder.  Here, traffic analysis and/or majority ownership of
nodes would be more or less useless; one good attack would be to
overwhelm the network with flood of bogus message traffic.
Countermeasures to this attack could include a web of trust
arrangement, and configuring the nodes to only store and forward
messages signed by "trusted" users; at least this would force an
adversary to do some work to flood the network with garbage.
I believe it is reasonable to expect better anonymity to /always/
involve performance hits in latency, bandwidth, and local resource
usage, relative to "normal" routing protocols.
In practical terms, today's anonymizing technology /probably/ imposes
sufficient delays on the identification of users and who is talking to
whom that physical anonymity - i.e. making only brief connections to
open wireless routers at locations where one is not seen coming and
going - should provide "really good" anonymity.  Of course one must
prevent the hardware from leaking identifiers via RF or TCP/IP vectors.
Conversely, repeatedly using anonymizing network protocols from one
location provides cover against low powered adversaries, while top
tier adversaries who by definition will know "who you are and who you
communicate with" may be restrained from hostile action by their
reluctance to disclose the existence of "sensitive sources and
methods."  That is, until or unless they find your activities /really/
annoying, and spend a little money / take a little risk setting you up

Alex get so many free promotional placements on national TV networks?
But wait, there's more:  Not only does Alex know what is /really/

instructs his audience to follow a two step plan.
1)  Expose the Conspiracy by promoting the Alex Jones message.
2)  Arm yourself and prepare to kill the Evil People.

killing the Conspirators and their puppets in political office will
automatically solve all the world's problems.  Don't laugh - the

Hash: SHA1
This news is nearly 40 years old and to me, not very interesting
because I already know way too much about it.  Suggested lines of
inquiry:  How much of the reported results and subsequent funding of
CIA sponsored psychic research was done with an eye to prompting
other, less well funded intelligence services overseas to expend
resources attempting to duplicate the reported results?  How much of
the publicity surrounding these projects was intended to support
influence operations targeting superstitious foreign leaders and
populations?  And how much was a straight up scam raiding Uncle Sam's
piggy bank to keep "scientists" more aligned with P.T. Barnum's world
view than Einstein's in business?
FTA:  "The letter goes on to say that the Committee hadnât made âany
determination to endorse the experimentation as valid or invalid,
[but] it does find that continued activity in this field may offer
promise in applications to intelligence problems.â Therefore,
Congressman Rose was scheduling a briefing from Doctors Puthoff and
Targ, who were involved in the project."
Puthoff and Targ were celebrities in the paranormal and pop psychology
press at the time, "almost as if" publicity was their principal
occupation.  In the area of psychic research, they endorsed Israeli
stage magician Uri Geller's effects, often accomplished through the
agency of Geller's assistant who was allowed free run of the facility
where the "tests" were conducted, as demonstrations of genuine
telekinesis and ESP.  The facility in question was the Stanford
Research Institute, a CIA front located in Menlo Park, California.
The Stanford Research Institute also produced a remarkably influential
document called A Course In Miracles, the de facto Bible of the New
Age movement in the 1980s and 90s.  ACIM presents as a giant circular
argument persuasively selling the proposition that the reader is alone
in an otherwise empty Universe, and that all of her experiences are
voluntarily projected illusions. (They typical devotee was a
successfully divorced upper middle class female in her 40s.)
But other people /do/ exist in that ACIM passes judgment on them:
Those who are healthy, wealthy and "believers" are morally and
spiritually superior to anyone who may be sick, poor or attached to
"rationality," so every victim of every misfortune or abuse has
volunteered for it.  The only way to really help them is to tell them
to stop doing that.
In the ACIM frame of reference, unconditional belief can solve
literally any problem by making it vanish, and the book includes a one
year cycle of mental exercises with an emphasis on making "bad things"
go away through denial.  Its target market was people with lots of
disposable income, mobility, and too much time on their hands, and
ACIM worked for them.
ACIM presents as a very successful psyops a.k.a. mind control
operation.  It created a durable and influential subculture, splitting
a demographic group that has historically supported and promoted
liberal and humanitarian political and social movements, taking most
of that market's social climbers (opinion leaders) all the way out of
the game.
But that was probably just a coincidence.

"Sealed documents" allegedly leaked by an anonymous source - but not

the only indication that Wikileaks failed to publish an important

Cryptography is a tool, not a magic cure-all.  There is a time and
place to lock adversaries out of your comms channels, and a time and
place to be very visible.  To tell the difference on a case by case
basis, ask yourself:  "Does my use of wide open public comms do more
harm to my interests or to those of my adversaries?"  It's a piss poor
pitiful Anarchist, who refuses to use an adversary's infrastructure to

Those who insist on trying to conceal their identities and/or

influence game.  If you have a protocol for broadcasting a persistent,
responsive, influential political message without being identified by
well funded surveillance actors, do please share it:  That would be a
fundamental and unexpected breakthrough.  Otherwise, such an effort
only starts a count-down timer - when will a well funded surveillance
actor take the trouble to find out who you are, and trace your

battle space where multiple factions compete to influence both
ephemeral swarms and more durable herd movements.  I have never seen

the physical world - economic, technological and geophysical - are now
rendering previously stable political systems obsolete and
unmaintainable.  New institutional templates adapted to new conditions
emerge because people adapt their social and economic behavior to new
conditions; not because Great Visionary Leaders issue a call to arms.
 The political agitation and violence we call a "revolution" is only
the last stage of the actual revolutionary process, terminating it and
establishing a new institutional stability for the benefit of a new
set of power players.
We all want to change the world.  But if you have a real solution, we
all need to see the plan.  Restricting its distribution to "secure and
anonymous" channels only guarantees it won't reach an audience that
can implement it.  Where and as surprise actions provide strategic
advantage, do use cryptographic technology - IF your co-conspirators
are also up to it, which almost never happens in real life.  When
physical meetings where all electronics are banned are practical, they
can facilitate useful goal setting, coordination and planning.  The
surveillance networks will follow most of your group to and from the
meeting place, but otherwise moles and unwitting informants will be
the only security risks affecting the meeting itself.

Good point:  I was mostly serious, though of course I would never
imagine that clandestine security services "obey the law" just because
it's the law - the reason they are "clandestine" is to enable them to
break the law at will.  The FBI and the military intelligence services
have traditionally been rivals, very protective of the boundaries
defining their respective turfs.  But now that the FBI enforces U.S.
law against foreign nationals on foreign soil - a rather bizarre
development - it is easy to imagine that mechanisms for routine
integration of FBI and NSA functions have developed.
The example above - NSA and DEA working hand in hand - may not be the
most relevant indicator though.  Back when Phil Agee went walkabout
and wrote Inside The Company, there was a firestorm of controversy and
Congress yanked the CIA's leash hard by slashing budgets for U.S.
terrorist operations in South and Central America.  At that time the
DEA stepped in and took up the slack, as it was well positioned to
bypass Congress and fund its own operations by dealing drugs.  Since
the 1970s the DEA has been ass deep in political warfare overseas, so
I think it is reasonable to presume that they have a long standing BFF
relationship with both CIA and NSA.
FBI?  Maybe, maybe not, but on reflection I do think it's likely that
barriers between that organization and NSA etc. are falling fast, if
not already completely gone.
All that said, I do think the method the FBI says it used to bust the
Playpen trash would have been both practical, more cost effective and
easier to sell as "legal" in Court than farming it out to the NSA.

So whatever they are hiding is probably not this:
"The FBI used a vulnerability in Firefox 17, on which the Tor browser
is based, to turn Freedom Hosting sites into malware spreading tracker
tools. It all works on the Firefox 17 JavaScript Zero Day Exploit;
this malicious script is a tiny Windows executable hidden variable
named Magneto which looks for victims MAC address and its hostname
and sends it back as a HTTP web request to the Virginia server to
expose the users real IP address. The FBI successfully gained access
to the Freedom Hosting server and injected malicious HTML code, which
checks whether the users browser is Firefox 17 or not."
Which raises the question, what ARE they hiding?  Some options, in no
particular order...
1)  An as-yet undetected and unpatched vulnerability affecting Firefox
and/or the TOR router was used - and the defense team knows it.
2)  The defendant may have traded some information or cooperation, or
may have an "insurance file" with enough evidence to convict someone
at FBI or DOJ of his same charges or worse.
3)  The FBI decided to pick one suspect to kick loose with a bogus
story indicating an as-yet undetected and unpatched vulnerability, for
propaganda purposes.

Hash: SHA1
Perhaps "no" was shorthand for, "The widely repeated assertion that
Russia penetrated the DNC's mail servers and gave their contents to
Wikileaks is an obvious lie."
Why obvious?
The Russian Hacking claim was first made in an October, 2016 press
release from DHS that attributes it to "the USIC."  No less an
Independent Security Authority than Bruce Schneier has asserted that
the public was not told about Russian Hacking until /after/ the
election, in support of his position that the story was not intended
to affect U.S. election results.  How deep does this bullshit go?
"All the way down" apparently.
Since there is no such agency or department as "the United States
Intelligence Community," that means the content of the initial press
release is not attributable to any auditable process or responsible
party.  Worse, it does not actually say "Russia did it."  Instead it
says that the leak was consistent with Russia's motives and methods.
That's all it actually says, but it says that in a context where an
uncritical reader can have no doubt that it said "Russia did it and we
have proof."  The rest of the press release is a lengthy statement
assuring us that Russia, despite its digital superpowers, can not
alter the actual election results.
A second, post-election press release makes more detailed assertions,
and presents graphics depicting information about "hacking groups,"
already available to the public, to support the belief that "we know
all the details about how Russia did it."  Nothing connects these
completely generic diagrams to the DNC servers - but "seeing is
believing" and plenty of people do believe.
A third and even more lengthy and elaborate press release falsely
calls itself a declassified intelligence report.  I say "falsely"
because it bears no classification or distribution markings, no
declassification notice, and no redaction markings.  This very
jargon-dense fake intelligence report reiterates previously made
assertions in Hollywood style spook-speak obviously calculated to
confuse and impress a naive audience.
We are consistently told that the red hot smoking gun evidence that
proves Russia Did It can not be released to the public because it is
Top Secret.  Presumably, releasing any evidence at all would
compromise sensitive methods and sources.  But...  News flash:  When
you tell the opposition what you know and when you knew it, you have
already compromised your sensitive sources and methods.  Meanwhile,
when an intelligence service creates a 100% convincing impression that
it is waging political warfare against its domestic audience through
Big Lie propaganda, the resulting loss of confidence and prestige does
more damage to The National Security than the release of /one/
fragment of evidence in support of the propaganda narrative could
possibly do.
There's an old political slogan used by resistance movements:  "The
whole world is watching."  We can update that today:  "The whole world
is laughing."  And not just at the illiterate buffon in the Oval
Office:  The NeoLiberal DNC and its partisans at CIA are equally
laughable thanks to their grim determination to keep pushing their
favorite Big Lie narrative, as if there was no other grounds to
demonize the illiterate buffoon's Administration.
That's dangerously close to the classic propaganda technique called
Argument From Ignorance:  "Your failure to prove me wrong, proves me
right."  Not quite that, but dangerously close.

Thunderbird works for me.  Every message from the CPunks list that

cause the folder name in the folders list to change color, and
increment the message count next to the folder name.  "Easy to spot"
becomes a non-issue; new messages are nearly impossible to miss, and
all the messages from the list are viewed in context with the rest of
the messages from the list when the folder is opened.
It is also very easy to create new filter rules to sort a given "from"
address into a CPunks Spam folder, which in my case is about 20% of
the messages from the list.  "One click" enables me to check these for
anything interesting or useful, although such is rarely found.
Adding the list name to every subject line means pushing every subject
line n. spaces to the right, with what I would call redundant visual
clutter.  Looking at the list messages display in Thunderbird I count
six presently visible subject lines that end in ... because they are
longer than the column they appear in, /without/ a redundant list name
in front of them.
That is GMail's semi-equivalent of filtering messages into folders,
but there's a way better method IMO:  Use Thunderbird.  GMail supports
the IMAP protocol, so a GMail account looks and works "the same as" a
real e-mail account when accessed via Thunderbird.  That also cuts the
attack surface for Google's friendly, harmless Javascript / AJAX right
out of the picture.
Also, Thunderbird + Enigmail = complete and user friendly GPG support
for webmail accounts, with no time consuming failure prone

What I call the Scientician faith is a very widespread popular
religion, maybe the first really successful atheist religious sect.
In the U.S. its followers number in the tens of millions and include
most self identifying "Liberals" as well as numerous "Libertarians"
and others who pin a large part of their self esteem on the notion
that they are "smarter" than other people.  The Scientician priesthood
- - everyone who claims the title "scientist" and is available through
speakers' bureaus and press agents - replaces the functions of the
Church as "explainer of everything" and "Voice of Divine Authority."
The apocalyptic prophesy I refer to is more or less the same scenario
I outlined earlier:  The impact of resource depletion, environmental
degradation, population pressure etc. on human affairs in the next
couple of decades.
There is a sharp divide between the scientists and Scienticians over
what the outcome will be:  A broad consensus among working scientists
in relevant fields says "life as we know it" will be ending shortly;
massive losses are inevitable; and immediate, radical remedial action
is warranted.
But our Scienticians are happy to promote the belief that by throwing
enough money at the symptoms when they become too severe to ignore,
all the problems arising from the Industrial Revolution can be solved
to everyone's satisfaction by Startling Miracles of Super Science.
The Scientician position has practical consequences:  It maximizes
Corporate executive compensation packages, Corporate shareholder
capital gains, and both poverty and human fatalities among the "lower

The State fully endorses the Scientician approach, as the State's sole
function is to transfer money and power from the poor to the rich at
the fastest practicable rate.  As always, symbolic "initiatives" and
strongly worded press releases are sufficient responses to public
pressure to "do something" about, for instance, global warming.
When our propaganda industries co-opted the image of science as a
marketing tool, this already complex and contentious field of human
activity became a /real/ hairball.  Almost nobody who lacks formal

much less evaluating, claims made In The Name Of Science today.

and very possibly an unwitting agent selected from a pool of
candidates provided by the Insider Threat Program.  Am I the only one
who has noticed that every real-world consequence of The Snowden
Affair has benefited his former employers?
Snowden's freedom of action ended when he handed Glen Greenwald a
collection of documents that brought in $250 million when Greenwald
shopped them around.  From that time forward Ed has been a prisoner in
a portable cage, because for reasons known only to himself he decided
to sign his name vs. concealing his identity.  Lest we forget, Chelsea
Manning was only busted because she said too much to a snitch - and Ed
certainly knew that.
The first thing the Snowden docs were used for was to open up NSA
domestic network surveillance as an issue for Congress to settle.
They did so by allowing it to continue, and in the process established
that lying to Congress under oath is not a crime if the DCI does it.
There are huge advantages in picking the time and place of a fight in
advance and preparing in depth before making "the other guy" start it.
The second thing the Snowden docs were used for was to keep the
Manning trial out of the news.  Greenwald reportedly fought with his
editors to move the publication date up to coincide with the first day
of Manning's trial.  They did so and the result was "Chelsea who?  Oh,
that's over and done with ages ago."
The only real damage the Snowden Docs did to State interests was not
done by them at all:  The popular press falsely attributes leaked NSA
docs originating in Germany, i.e. the one that revealed Merkel's

became their champion when he gave Hillary Clinton a free pass after
an FBI investigation determined that she had a habit of removing
classification markings from documents before forwarding them to
people who were not cleared to see them, and instructing her staff to
do likewise.  That's multiple felony counts with enhanced penalties
for "conspiracy," unless you're a Clinton.
Later, Comey was the Yellow Dog Democrats' last, best hope for
removing Trump from office, as they believed he was directing an
investigation that would end in prosecuting Trump as a Russian agent:
 The famous Russian Hacking story and its accessory sub-plots.
Hillarious, ain't it?

I thought he was talking about "the Internet," not the thingy that's
under development.  "...any individual with a network connection and a
bright idea may collaborate with any other any individual with a network
connection who likes that idea" would have been more accurate, but maybe
a little redundant.

Quite sure:  Taking measures to specifically deny the passphrase to
gnupg-agent fixed the problem at once.  Also, I was using KDE4 at the
time, on a system where Cinnamon is the default desktop.
I created gpg-agent.conf and put it in the right directory per the man
page, because it was not there... and it had no effect.
Especially disturbing because, although I never have a reason to type a
GPG pass phrase as an administrator, logging out of my user account did
not remove the pass phrase from memory.  Nothing short of powering off
did the job.

Beg to disagree:  As an example, the original Labor Movement forced the
Robber Barons to accept a settlement negotiated through State
institutions.  The New Deal worked, not just in the U.S. but also in
Germany where the Nazi party applied many features of that model and
pulled the country back from the brink of starvation.  Even given the
then-prevailing German tradition of unconditional obedience to
authority, they would most likely have rebelled against the excesses of
the Nazi agenda had the Party not earned their loyalty by literally
saving their country from total ruin.
Likewise, the U.S. Civil Rights movement obtained massive concessions
via economic and information warfare, again resulting in a negotiated
settlement between organized peasants and their rulers.
Conditions favorable for a massive popular uprising seem to be on the
way in the United States right now, as a consequence of geophysical and
geopolitical factors no amount of Super Science or etc. can wish away.
Now would be a good time to brush up on one's political warfare
techniques, and start looking for winning teams to join up with - or for
that matter, to start one's own.
Don't let the "nonviolent" thing put you off:  Everyone from Mao Tse
Tung to the authors of current U.S. Army counter-insurgency manuals
agrees, an armed uprising can not succeed without a /much/ larger base
of non-combatant supporters.  As a matter of historical fact,
revolutions are won or lost before the first shot is fired.

@_subject: Fwd: Stanford Liberationtech Needs Your Help 
from Yosem Companys  :
Hi All,
The Program on Liberation Technologies at Stanford University (LT) has
been going strong since circa 2006. Since then, LT has helped thousands
design, use, and research technologies that foster the public good.
Recently, the decision was made to spin off LT as an independent entity.
I'm one of the people tasked with doing so. Here are LT's major needs:
    Recruit people to develop a new website, logo, and graphics.
    Identify a legal jurisdiction with strong security and privacy laws
and regulations and a server provider with a stellar reputation at
protecting user security and privacy to host the site.
    Determine whether to maintain LT's mailing lists on Mailman or to
transition them to a content management system (e.g., Discourse.org).
    Assess the best legal structure for LT (e.g., digital cooperative).
Any ideas? Thanks for your help and advice.
P.S. I'm sending this email on behalf LT's co-founders and not Stanford

I could not help noticing the belligerent, authoritarian tone of that
Punk's commentary.  Indeed, I do not recall seeing a post under the
"Punk" signature that did not include plenty of same.
Authoritarian regimes agree:  Anarchism causes them nothing but trouble.
 Efforts to eradicate anarchism present as the longest running examples
of classic political warfare in modern times, continuously adapting to
changes in society and technology.
State sponsored propagandists work at scrubbing anarchism out of history
and popular culture, replacing it with their own alternative theory and
practice of infantile, narcissistic and completely self defeating
pseudo-anarchism.  This regimen of black propaganda continuously
recruits and develops enough unwitting State political warfare assets to
significantly degrade the performance of grass roots political
Radical organizers and facilitators develop strategies and skill sets to
contain and control the antics of weaponized pseudo-anarchists in public
meetings and on the street.  A mature, stable activist community does
spontaneous, organic triage on disruptive pseudo-anarchsits when they
show up, educating and assimilating as many as possible but eventually
ejecting those who present as pathological and non-recoverable.
Anarchism does not mean "Fuck you, I do what I want!"  That's across the
street, under the Fascism sign.
Then what DOES anarchism mean?  Get lots of major clues here:

My small contribution comes in at only 1400 words:
The Prisoner: An Introduction
The Prisoner is one of the most iconic and surrealistic, if not
psychedelic, products of the 1960s "golden age" of television.  An angry
secret agent returns home from hand delivering his letter of
resignation, when he is immediately gassed by an undertaker in top hat
and tails.  He regains consciousness in his own bed but when he looks
out his window he discovers that he is no longer home at all:  He is in
The Village, a deceptively idyllic holiday resort that is actually a
high tech prison for spies.  At once the games begin.
In The Village, people are known by numbers, not names.  Our abducted
protagonist is Number 6.  The commander in chief of The Village is
Number 2 - a post occupied by a series of individuals, most of whom have
one principal job:  To psychologically break Number 6, in order learn
all he knows beginning with why he resigned - and, if possible, to
recruit him into whatever service operates The Village.  Who, or in Cold
War parlance "which side," runs The Village?  What makes Number 6 so
important to them?  Among the residents of The Village, "Who are the
prisoners, and who the warders?"  Direct or final answers are rarely found.
Since its release in 1967/68 the Prisoner has been addressed in
documentaries, books and a large volume of fan literature, examining
every aspect of the series in detail.  International fan clubs are still
active today:  Six Of One ("The Prisoner Appreciation Society") hosts an
annual convention at Portmeirion, the Welsh resort where the series was
filmed.  Why do these 17 hours of enigmatic television have such durable
appeal?  Where does The Prisoner hook into our gut instincts and
cultural zeitgeist?
The Prisoner is a product of its times:  During the Cold War spies,
conspiracies and covert operations were among the principal weapons of
East and West.  Along with the deployment of large clandestine services
by the Superpowers, Western popular culture was inundated with spy
propaganda in the form of books, movies and TV shows glamorizing spies
as real-life superheroes.  Ian Fleming, a former OSS officer who worked
with the founders of MI-5 and the CIA, led the charge with his best
selling James Bond novels.  In short order spy fiction became a hugely
popular and profitable genre in television and motion pictures.
Prior to this media barrage, espionage was generally considered a
disreputable trade - a dishonest, dishonorable and even cowardly
approach to warfare.  The spy fiction of the Cold War era turned the
public image of the clandestine services all the way around - no expense
was spared in presenting espionage as a daring, heroic and altogether
admirable business, and the public responded enthusiastically.  This
glamorous image lasted into the 1970s, when public disclosure of
programs like COINTELPRO, the Phoenix Program and first hand accounts of
CIA field work by Phil Agee and others shattered the illusion.
The Prisoner has a lesser known back story:  In 1960, British TV
producer Ralph Smart created a spy series, Danger Man, starring Patrick
McGoohan as John Drake.  In each half hour episode Drake, a spy of
deliberately ambiguous nationality working for NATO, was dispatched on a
new international assignment.  Drake's doings were much more realistic
than Bond's - his assignments included counter-espionage, political
interventions in post-colonial nations, and some missions bordering on
international law enforcement.  He battled no super-villains, seduced no
glamorous women, and always preferred strategic deception to
ultra-violence:  "I never carry a gun.  They're noisy and they hurt
people.  Besides, I do very well without."
Only one season of the Danger Man series was produced for the British
domestic market.  The show did well in the UK and became very popular in
the U.S. where it was titled Secret Agent, with Johnny Rivers singing
the title theme Secret Agent Man,  on the U.S. pop charts.  McGoohan
became a hot media property:  In 1962, he turned down an offer from Eon
Productions to star in Dr. No, the first James Bond film; this was Sean
Connery's big break.
After a two year hiatus, two more seasons of Danger Man were produced
for international distribution.  The revived series clearly identified
Drake as a British intelligence officer working for M6, a fictional
British agency.  Its one hour format allowed more complex stories and
some development of the Drake character, including elements of moral
ambiguity and substantial friction and resentment between Drake and his
employers.  Critics and the public loved it.  A 4th series was abandoned
after only two episodes were produced, for reasons that remain unclear.
 McGoohan and Danger Man script editor George Markstein already had a
new project in mind: The Prisoner.
To avoid licensing issues - and promote the mystique of the new series -
McGoohan and the production staff for The Prisoner always pointedly
denied that Number 6 was John Drake.  But if our Number 6 was anyone
else, Drake must have had a twin with identical attitudes, personality
and occupational experience.  Why did Drake resign from M6, and why was
this question the constant theme of attempts by his captors to break him
down?  If I told you I would have to kill you.  We are advised that
"questions are a burden to others, answers a prison for oneself."
Many viewers were disappointed by The Prisoner's two-part series
conclusion, Once Upon A Time and Fall Out:  Even compared to the other
Prisoner episodes they are rather bizarre.  Those who know what the word
"allegory" means won't be disappointed, if they are in a mood for a
story told in a series of events that point toward psychological,
political and perhaps even autobiographical paths to the solution of
Drake's enigma.  At the end of the final episode, the closing credits
show that Number 6 was played by "The Prisoner" rather than Patrick
McGoohan.  I have my own suspicions about this final touch of quirky
humor, but "a still tongue makes a happy life."
Both The Prisoner and Danger Man are available as commercial DVD sets
and, of course, via covert channels on the usual networks.
Be seeing you!
A note from your Citizen's Advice Bureau:
Unsolved mysteries in The Prisoner include the correct sequence of the
episodes:  They were produced out of order for logistical reasons, and
delays in production interrupted the series' original broadcast run.
The first episode and the final two are obviously in their right places,
but the rest?  Detailed analysis of the content of the episodes
themselves provides some clues, and this order from a project published
by Six Of One is very satisfactory:
01 - Arrival
02 - Dance Of The Dead
03 - Free For All
04 - The Chimes Of Big Ben
05 - Checkmate
06 - The General
07 - A B & C
08 - The Schizoid Man
09 - Many Happy Returns
10 - Living In Harmony
11 - A Change Of Mind
12 - Hammer Into Anvil
13 - Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling
14 - It's Your Funeral
15 - The Girl Who Was Death
16 - Once Upon A Time
17 - Fallout - Series Finale
Prior acquaintance with John Drake enables us to view The Prisoner in
its native context.  These episodes of Danger Man provide a well rounded
introduction to the fictional man behind the famous number:
Episode 52 - That's Two Of Us Sorry:  Drake investigates a theft of
nuclear research secrets that leads him into morally hazardous human
Episode 54 - Whatever Happened to George Foster:  Drake catches a
respected NGO doing dirty politics in Latin America, leading to a
personal war against Establishment adversaries at home.
Episode 57 - The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove:  Foreshadowing the surrealism
of The Prisoner, Drake battles a hostile spy ring's recruitment front
while slightly out of his mind.
Episode 58 - It's Up To The Lady:  A realistic spy story about
retrieving a defector by using his wife for leverage, with a
too-realistic twist.
Episode 70 - The English Lady Takes Lodgers:  Sometimes a spy yarn is
only a spy yarn, and sometimes Drake's occupation permits him to play
the perfect knight.
Episode 74, To Our Best Friend:  McGoohan directs this episode which
pits Drake against his employers from beginning to end.
Episode 84 - The Not-So-Jolly Roger:  A conventional period spy story in
a most unconventional period setting:  Filmed on location at Pirate
Radio 390, Red Sands Fort.
