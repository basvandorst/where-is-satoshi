Sounds like a "human rights worm". Some people thought about that before [1].
Aside from the obvious ethical difficulties, I would consider such a worm as
highly problematic because it works in the "interest" of an independent project
and would eventually damage its reputation (just think about how the media would
interpret it). And a damaged reputation might decrease Tor's user diversity
which, on the other hand, would hurt anonymity.

The standard TBB does not work because Ethiopia is currently fingerprinting and
dropping both, the TLS client and server hello. More details are available here:
However, there are slightly modified bridges which can circumvent this block and
make Tor usable from within Ethiopia. (You'll get such a bridge by writing to
"help at rt.torproject.org".)
