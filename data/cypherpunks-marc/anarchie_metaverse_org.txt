Seems all it just was a scare.
Powder proves harmless after Sydney anthrax scare
   Authorities have described as harmless a white powder-like substance
   found at the international terminal of Sydney Airport earlier today.
   An area near the Qantas check-in service was cordoned off as
   authorities in protective outfits examined the suspicious substance
   found on ticket documentation in the Qantas ticket sales office late
   this afternoon.
   A Qantas spokeswoman says the white powdery like substance was found
   on pre-printed documents.
   The scare comes as United States officials deal with five new cases of
   exposure to anthrax.

nightclub toilets)

Seems that AP may be in practice right now..
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Police are probing an Israeli gambling ring suspected
of putting its money on a grim game of chance -- predicting the target of
the next Palestinian suicide bombing.
The betting ring was set up in the southern Israeli town of Kiryat
Malachi, where local gamblers can fill out a form that gives odds for
different cities and regions in Israel, the Tel Aviv weekly Zman Tel Aviv
reported Friday.
