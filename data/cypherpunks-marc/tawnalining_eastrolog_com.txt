Your comfort and convenience is our prime concern. Give up:  One summer evening, during a violent thunderstorm, a mother was tucking her
small boy into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked¡¡with
a tremor in his voice, "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?"¡¡The mother
smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. "I can't dear," she said, "I have to
sleep with Daddy."A long silence was broken at last by a shaken little voice
saying, "The big sissy."
Billy and Bobby were small boys. They were brothers, and they often had
fights with each other.Last Saturday their mother said to them, "I'm going
to cook our lunch now. Go out and play in the garden - and be good.""Yes,
Mummy," the two boys answered, and they went out.They played in the garden
for half an hour, and then Billy ran into the kitchen, "Mummy, " he said,
"Bobby's broken a window in Mrs. Allen's house." Mrs. Allen was one of their
neighbors."He's a bad boy," his mother said. "How did he break it?""I threw
a stone at him," Billy answered,"and he quickly moved down.".
