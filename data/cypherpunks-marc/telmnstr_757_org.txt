@_subject: Re: Roy Bates, "Prince Roy" of Sealand, dies at 90. 
Octal gave a talk at Defcon or HOPE a few years in a row about Sealand. The last one he spilled the beans on how bad Sealand did. Managerial and customer base wise. IIRC for months the entire internet connection was done over a cell phone at 9600bps or some such. He went into some details about difficulties of the idea (banks won't accept you.) One of the most memorable talks I've seen.
