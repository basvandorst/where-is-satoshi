@_subject: Re: Intel to also add RNG 
The Smart Card industry uses True RNG a lot. There, a common line of
thought is to use:
- a hardware RNG, which raw output (perhaps biased) is directly
accessible for testing purposes (only), so that the software can check
it in depth at startup and from time to time to ascertain that it is at
least generating a fair amount of entropy
- followed by appropriate post-processing in hardware (so as to gather
entropy at all time), acting as a mixer/debiaser:; e.g. something LFSR-based
- followed by a crude software test (e.g. no bit stuck)
- optionally followed by software postprocessing (the subject is
debated; this software has to be proven to not include weakness, and the
hardware + crude software test is certified to eliminate such weakness,
so why bother, some say)
There is a standard, known as AIS31, on evaluating True RNG, which
de-facto enforces the first three steps
which references
For German-reading audience, the page linking to that is
Google does good work when fed with AIS31.
