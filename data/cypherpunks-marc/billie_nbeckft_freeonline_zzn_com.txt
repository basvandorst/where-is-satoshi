HOT OF THE WIRE Diamond Bay Holdings Telecom Subsidiary Signs First
International Distributor

Platform Throughout Africa Immediately FALLS CHURCH, Va,--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 25,
  2005--Diamond Bay Holdings, Inc. (OTC:
  DBHD -
  News) announced today
  that its wholly-owned subsidiary, DBH Telecom, has signed an agreement with
  its first major distributor to commence immediate international deployment of
  DBH Telecom's prepaid "Call Virtuosity(TM)" service platform. The distributor,
  a U.S.-based company with operating subsidiaries in Africa, will release "Call
  Virtuosity(TM)"-based services to all 54 countries in the African continent
  under the TalkAfrica label. "Call Virtuosity(TM)" is a feature-rich,
  rechargeable calling card program that delivers multiple voice services and
  can be tailored to the unique needs of different geographic and ethnic
  markets. The "Call Virtuosity(TM)" platform enables customers' numbers to be
  automatically recognized for convenience and allows users to order call back
  through a web browser and SMS messaging from their cell phones at per-minute
  rates that are highly competitive with other leaders in the industry. In addition, DBH Telecom's "Call
  Virtuosity(TM)" offerings enable distributors and agents to rapidly provide a
  suite of domestic and international calling services. The company's
  proprietary customer portal enables distributors to develop their own
  customized web sites, complete with outsourcing of related ecommerce
  transactions to deliver turnkey services. "DBH Telecom offers an attractive bundle of
  easy-to-use solutions that are globally competitive and which distributors can
  deploy with minimal up-front costs," said John Page, president of DBH Telecom.
  "We have identified the fast-growing telecom market in Africa as a key area of
  expansion for our company and we are very excited that our first international
  distributor is onboard." The company is now in discussions with other
  potential distributors in growing markets around the world to bring its
  services to new geographic areas that it believes will offer the best
  opportunity to achieve high margins and early payback. The global demand for telecommunications
  products and services continues to increase and now exceeds $1 trillion annually, with more than 140 billion
  international minutes used, according to the ITU.   Telecom's product plan also includes future enhancements to serve the money
  remittance services segment, in which workers' remittances to developing
  countries reached $80 billion in 2002, up from $60 billion in 1998, according
  to a recent World Bank report. DBH Telecom's planned near-term enhancements
  include a pre-paid debit card with global ATM capability for sale as part of
