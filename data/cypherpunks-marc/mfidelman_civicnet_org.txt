@_subject: status of various projects? 
It seems like a lot of interesting projects haven't been active for a
while - notably Free Haven and Eternity Usenet.  Where is the most active
work, these days,  on distributed publishing systems?

GREAT idea! Sort of like the Space Shuttle computers - 5 operating in
parallel, one from a completely different hardware and software vendor.

I think it's called OCR.
Paper ballots, marked by the voter, not by software, then counted by
- the ballot and the audit document are one and the same - no opportunity
for software to mess with the printed record
- option for a quick and dirty recount by feeding the ballots through a
different counting machine (maybe with different software, from a
different vendor)
- further option for a manual recount of the original ballots (which are
probably more legible than any machine-printed receipts)
Oh, and by the way, these are the only kind of electronic voting machines
approved, so far, in Mass.

I don't know about that.  Today's corporate oligarchy behaves an awful lot
like the old Soviet oligarchy.  Just the names and titles are different.
