(As annoying as the bottom post is to us?)
Sorry couldn't resist, and refuse to get drawn into another=20
top versus bottom posting discusion....
Renegade,  the people in this list feal very strongly against top posting..=
right or wrong, either way it's the standard for all SUSE lists, and has=20
always been that way.    Think you can compromise and give into this?
I also agree, that if we started helping technical questions, it would conf=
people more than really help.  And the danger of this list getting swamped=
with technical questions is very very real....
I add my thx to Houghi also....  It's an unpleasant job his doing but a=20
necesary one.
If there is a discusion, then my 2=A2 is not to private...  It seams to me =
would open other can of worms.  My experience is that any private email
is an open invitation to private help.  I simply refuse to PM anybody askin=
for help.
I understand both sides of the story.  But I also had to swallow twice when=
 I=20
was "asked" to go to the technical list.
No I don't know of how to phase it better....
how about one of our European colleagues?
as they are famous for their tact, and sauve?
