i agree with your analysis of NSA's job, but not with your statement that
no one denies that its job is legitimate.
on the contrary, while both Snowden and Greenwald, if read carefully, agree
with you (at least mostly), virtually everyone who comments on the Snowden
materials, including some very prominent journalists & bloggers, hackers &
activists & technologists, and many others, strike me as absolutely denying
that there is any legitimate case for not leaving blind spots. i suspect
many on this list deny it too, though I wouldn't pretend to speak for them.
i wish what you said were true, but I see much evidence to the contrary: in
fact, I sometimes think that this is the point.
sense of large black budgets, I'm not sure exactly what you might be
referring to.

as long as we have our tinfoil hats on, one data point to keep in mind here
is to remember that USGov, despite having many uniform policies, is also
shot through with warring fiefdoms and turfs.
Snowden and Michael Hayden both have the odd career path CIA - NSA. To say
that is unusual is to make an enormous understatement. we are usually told,
"once CIA, always CIA." you can't "quit." and there are hundreds of stories
over 50+ years of history to suggest this.
CIA and NSA have often been thought not to be on the same page, largely
because NSA is military and CIA is civilian (or whatever special/uber
designation it has at this point). CIA sees itself as entitled to operate
much *more* lawlessly than NSA.
it is not hard to imagine scenarios where CIA might want to weaken NSA
capabilities in part via public embarrassment. and one involved in the plot
could even go public with his statements about how damaging the leaks are.
our noble leaker(s) would not even necessarily need to know how it was
possible to grab so much information without being stopped/noticed.

Snowden can't really sign the files if he has absolutely no access to them,
which is a critical part of the current story, otherwise we'd be right to
worry about his proximity to the FSB.

mentioned in the analyses that worry about Bitcoin's energy use, and for
good reason.
the problem with Bitcoin is that it uses an enormous QUANTITY of energy to
verify each new transaction. That amount has nothing to do with the price
of energy. It is a quantity of energy, measured in kilowatt hours or
whatever quantity you want (they currently use "TeraWatt hours," because it
uses that much). It takes a certain amount of coal or oil or solar power to
generate those kilowatt hours, and the number is rising steeply:
There is no mention of price in the equations that produce this analysis,
nor should there be.
IF coal and oil did not pollute and we had infinite free energy, this would
not be a problem. But they do, and we don't, and it is, and it's getting

from the NIST report on WTC7, downloaded directly from NIST's own website,
at NIST report page xxxv: "This was the first known instance of the total
collapse of a tall building primarily due to fires."
in certain ways, having re-read a lot of this for the first time in years,
I'm inclined to side with the official explanation more than I used to be.
but if one is going to do that, it is dirty pool to argue against what the
report itself says in plain English at the same time. NIST engineers did/do
consider what happened at WTC7 to be unusual.
& again, a lot appears to be riding on the word "total."
NIST report, also page xxxv, also contradicting a fair amount of what some
here have said:
"Since WTC 7 was not doused with thousands of gallons of jet fuel, large
areas of any floor were not ignited simultaneously. Instead, the fires in
WTC 7 were similar to those that have occurred in several tall buildings
where the* automatic sprinklers did not function or were not present*. *These
other buildings did not collapse*, while WTC 7 succumbed to its fires."
if you want me to accept the NIST report, you can't ask us to accept
facts/reasoning based on one person's reasoning, when the NIST report
itself explicitly does not accept those facts or reasoning.

@_subject: Re: latest false flag attack? 
for anyone interested, the page I pointed at previously contains links both
to the official explanations for the fall of WTC7, which include many
references to evidence, and public documents that clash with certain
aspects of that explanation:
the especially interesting question about WTC7, which has been obscured
here a bit, is not *that* it fell, but *how* it fell. (very quickly,
near-symmetrically, into its own footprint, and in free fall for at least a
brief period of time, which NIST first denied because of how unusual it
would be, and then admitted, as the page above documents.) Unlike WTC1 and
2, which had central structures of various sorts and were tall, thin
buildings, and in the official explanation had damage via burning debris of
various sorts down those central structures that is said to partly account
for a symmetrical collapse, WTC7 was shorter and wider, had no central
structures, and had not even allegations of symmetrical damage of any sort.
*some*--but not all--of the reasoning and facts provided by both James and
Peter is not the same as that provided by NIST in its reviews.
NIST and its engineers had to work very, very, very hard to find a way to
mesh the available evidence with any structural analysis that could explain
how--again, not *that*--it fell.
here is a link to what I believe is the most recent article, peer-reviewed
in a standard engineering journal (the house organ of the ASCE), by one of
the senior NIST engineers with a very detailed explanation of how WTC7
fell. I am not an engineer, but only someone who reads things in as much
detail as possible. I continue to be struck by the number of times models
need to be adjusted in order to get anything like the collapse in its
observed form to work out, the novel nature of the models, the amount of
uncertainty that remains--and then, as the 9/11 Consensus Panel questions
suggest, the amount of available evidence that has to be jettisoned or
downplayed (or, in the skeptics' opinion, misrepresented) in order to get
any model at all to work. This includes the official explanation of how
damage to the top and side of the building could cause it to collapse into
its own footprint, which is at the very least, not a behavior engineers
expected, no matter how long it burned.

I find the work by the 9/11 Consensus Panel to be the best-documented, most
detailed, and most sober set of questions about the event that I've read.
they have quite a bit of good evidence collected regarding WTC 7, both the
official and plausible stories about what brought it down, and the
questions that they think remain. I agree with them. The explanations are
ad hoc, often stretching the limits of credulity, often at odds with
whatever physical evidence remains, and as in WTC 1 and 2, posit a
mechanism for building collapse that, whatever else you think about it, has
never been seen before or since, despite the fact that planes do crash into
buildings and fires do happen in buildings pretty frequently.
all their stuff is worth going through, but here's the WTC 7 material:
