I tried to restart my jabberd server and received the following message.  Looks like I deleted a tag somewhere but can not find where.  Can anyone help or can you forward me a default jabber.xml file?
[root jabber-1.4.2]# cd jabberd
[root jabberd]# ./jabberd &
[1] 887
[root jabberd]# Configuration parsing using jabber.xml failed: mismatched tag at line 260 and column 2
This is what is on line 260......
Thanks in advance.
