I agree.
As an aside to all the "It was because of the 2.6 kernel IPsec integration!" comments, mainly the ones I've seen on slashdot: thanks to Herbert Xu, the FreeS/WAN userspace tools work with the 2.6 kernel. As far as I'm concerned, they're on par with the ported KAME userland. The principal reason behind the project's end is due to funding fatigue. All the FreeS/WAN support/development done by the core team was paid for by the generosity of a small group of people, all in the name of perfecting Opportunistic Encryption. In the end, there were a good number of difficult technical hurdles to overcome that would have blocked widespread adoption - NAT, the DNS requirements - and there was no clear end in sight. Given that, it seemed appropriate to retire FreeS/WAN as the means by which to achieve universal encryption.
The 2.6 kernel was not a consideration. Given that FS works with it, I really scratch my head when I see people mentioning this as a potential cause. The end-of-project e-mail sums it up well.
