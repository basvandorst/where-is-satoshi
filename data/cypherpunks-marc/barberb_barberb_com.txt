I dislike the notion of the central directory auth, while not a SINGLE
point of failure, relying on someone else to know who to trust, is great
until you discover that the trust was underserved.
Operational security also seems to be glossed over to laypersons, which is
why I use to a solar powered computers running tor, that I network with a
private VPN server that I have running in germany.

You're right, I'm just a pandobot, trying to gather clickbait. Tor looks
completely safe, just listen to uncle Ed Snow.

The consequentialism of noble intentions isn't enough, I think alfred nobel
is a tribute to that road paved to hell, its far too easy to paint a rosy
picture, to make sure that the ship stays going, instead of going the route
of truecrypt or lavabit

Its already been discussed that VPN services and i2p are more secure for
passing data unbeknownst to others, not even to mention the merits of the
dir auths, and how they were being ddosed by lizard squad or were being
AFAIK i have never heard the explanation behind the onymous arrests, but
when the TOR leadership associates with Randi Harper and Lorrelai.
In the end, we're all known by the company that we keep. Tor members seem
to be making alot of ties to government and telecom, and associates with
people like randi harper and lorrelai as well.
Like i said in a previous thread, i was working on building tor hidden
services, and now I no longer care to help tor at all, i'd rather wash my
eyes with bleach, nice concept but wrong team and wrong implementation.

Except that TOR says they're going to help LEO with stop cyber criminals
according to briefings with UK parliament.
"you should treat me how I want to be treated" and "your rights end where
my feelings begin" are awfully close to one another.
I see government corruption within infosec to be a bigger ill, than whether
or not there is enough social justice, and its used most frequently by
charlatans and fools.
Thats not to mean that Tor is a government honeypot but its not secure
enough, but if the government makes tor popular people will not be
persuaded to more effective models.

This has been discussed in the past here, specifically with darpa / memex
thread, and the pando saga, and some documents submitted to UK parliment.
When tor and EFF "stand up against harassment", by supporting doxxing and
harassment by their own members, who go on bigoted and discriminatory rants.
Kelly and Jacob agree that Tor isn't for misogynistic harassers, its only
for victims of oppression by the kyiarchy, repeat it enough times maybe
it'll be true.
