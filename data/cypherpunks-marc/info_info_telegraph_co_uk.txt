ar Telegraph reader,

The BlackBerry enables you to wirelessly send an=
d receive emails, make phone calls, SMS, access your corporate network, and=
 the internet all on the move.
      technology works on GPRS, which means its always connected to the=
 network=20
      - so your emails are reviewed, and can be responded to, and you never=
 have=20
      to dial up.
You can take advantage of down-time on trains, at airports etc to catch up =
on emails, and follow up from meetings. You can even view Microsoft Office =
attachments to work efficiently on the move.
Typical BlackBerry users report they recover 47 minutes in down-time each w=
ork day, and save almost 30 minutes in personal time.
They can deal with work straight away - they don't need to make a special t=
rip to the office.
You too can ensure you don't get left behind - by reading our recently - la=
unched online Bus=
iness Travel section.
You can find all the latest news of interest to busy professionals on the m=
ove - from broadband on the Brighton line to mile-high massages.
Its all just a click away
Yours sincerely,
