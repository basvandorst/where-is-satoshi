@_subject: Now we have TWO bookstores and you can save 30% on all bookselling services! 
We just opened our second bookstore!  The Executive Center Bookstore in Martinsville, Indiana is now open for business.  Today we can guarantee your book will be sold in TWO stores. But we need more books to sell, so we are offering a 30% discount on all of our bookselling services.
Take 30% off any services, in any combination, in any quantity.  THIS WILL ALSO BE OUR BIGGEST ACROSS THE BOARD DISCOUNT IN 2005, so now is the time to sign up for Bowker/ Star Reviews, Bookstore Telemarketing, or any of our other bookselling services.
AS ALWAYS, WE WILL SELL YOUR BOOK EVEN IF YOU PUBLISHED WITH ANOTHER I also have 5 spots on the front page of our website that are up for grabs, so call me now!
