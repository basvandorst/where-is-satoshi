Well, there is a Free Software implementation called NewPG which
provides a backend called gpgsm - very similar to gpg.  It is
currently under development but we already exchanged encrypted
messages with proprietary implementations.  This backend will
eventually be included with gpg.  It does not yet work for Windows but
making it work won't be very difficult.
Like gpg, gpgsm does not handle the MIME encapsulation because this is
something a MUA can handle much better.  We have support for KMail and
Mutt in the works and adding it to Sylpheed will be easy.  See:
I don't suggest to use S/MIME; however in some domains (law conforming
digital signatures) there is currently no alternative for it.

Adi Shamir's TWINKLE, I guess.
That won't help unless you find a way to get random number as good as
the keysize.  The hack itself is trivial but I don't do it because
large keys are a headache for low-end machines and they trick users
into false security assumptions.  I am pretty sure that any PC or
usage of GnuPG can be broken by spending far less money.

Please add an argument for the available size of the buffer OUT and
check this length while encoding.  Over short or long someone will for

Because the v4 format fixes the flaw with the length of the parameters
and the way the fingerprint and keyid is calculated.
Well that means to reintroduce the requirement for that checking for
v4 keys again.  For a different reason of course.  And well, with the
SHA-1 weakness you still won't be able to find a second preimage for a
given key.

The problem is not the software but the protocol. You can't have
dynamically loadable sections for an RFC.  That would contradict the
very reason of having a standard.

That's true.  However as long as we don't know how to calculate such a
block (and I just guessed that it is similar to the MD5 attack - which
is not necessary true) we don't know whether 4 bytes at a fixed offset
are sufficient.
No, they are not vulnerable like v3 keyids.
They world harm the WoT or any other method of checking the identity
of a key because you usually compare the fingerprints out of band.

Assume that you have the power to create a calculation.  What would be
your target: A single message or a CA key? I'd go for a CA or other important key.  Here we rely on SHA-1 for
fingerprint calculation and the fingerprint is that piece of
information we almost always use to compare keys. You can't change

Flexibility opens the road for rollback attacks.  Thus it is sound to
rely on one specific algorithm for certain problem domains.
Assuming that the SHA-1 collision calculation is simialar to the MD5
one, tehre is even no immediate danger due to the way the fingerprints
are calculated: The first block used in the fingerprint calculation is
more or less a constant and can't be change to create a working faked

The real problem with the breakthrough is, that it seems that they
have developed a new cryptoanalytical method and that might pave the
way for further improvements.  Over the last 2 decades the art of
cryptoanalysis has changed dramatically in the area of symmetric
ciphers.  This will probably also happen to hash algorithms now.
There is however a huge problem replace SHA-1 by something else from
now to tomorrow: Other algorithms are not as well anaylyzed and
compared against SHA-1 as for example AES to DES are; so there is no
immediate successor of SHA-1 of whom we can be sure to withstand the
possible new techniques.  Second, SHA-1 is tightly integrated in many
protocols without a fallback algorithms (OpenPGP: fingerprints, MDC,
default signature algorithm and more).

@_subject: Re: RSA 1024 ridiculous 
Although I agree that 4096 bit RSA is far too paranoid, the size of a
file to encrypt is independent of the public key size.  The bulk of the
file is encrypted using a symmetric cipher, i.e AES 128 or 256.  SHA-256
is not used at all for encryption - only SHA-1 for a special kind of
checksum (a MIC).

That is a property of the card and not of the reader.  For example our
OpenPGP card may be configured to require a verify operation (i.e. to
enter a PIN) right before each sign operation.  TCOS cards may be
configured in a similar way.
Of course that doesn't solve the problem that you can't see what you
sign.  If you are in the habit of signing all mails it would be easy for
malware to substitute one mail signing by a money transaction signing
To do that the reader would need to know the card application's exact
working.  This is not possible for a general purpose device.

OpenPGP allows sending messages without information on the used keys
(e.g. gpg --throw-keyids).  Folks using many secret keys need to have a
bit more patience due to the required trial decryptions.
A mail can easily be wrapped into an message/rfc822 container along with
more innocent outer headers.  This would allow to keep on using the
existing mail infrastructure.
