<< the following from a thread on some of the fees related to fraud issues at Again, this is only a very small part of the problem. The Inspector General's office reports that the average identity fraud in the Social Security Administration costs over $100,000. Texas Medicaid loses approximately 25% of its $4 billion budget to fraud. The ABA reports that the average cost of each credit card fraud for the issuer exceeds $3500. Each incident of identity fraud in recruiting costs DOD over $500,000.

<< Of course. But this hasn't prevented people from acquiring and using credit cards. More to the point, it hasn't prevented the merchants, banks, and credit card issuers from maintaining and promoting this imperfect system. This would suggest that the losses from fraud (which customers don't pay, at least not here in the US) are amply covered by the income they bring in.
This sounds to me like a system that "works" in a practical sense. >>
In good times when a 5% loss factor disappeared in the profits it didn't matter. In times when every penny is being squeezed (Airlines), and fraud seems to have doubled the risk management view may have changed.

Not really. The problem that we fact today is that the identity information cat is out of the bag. Anyone can accurately assume anyone else's identity. The use of best match logic, out of wallet information, etc., all work if everyone is willing to follow the rules. However, the fact that identity fraud is growing at near 100% rates in the face of these approaches belies the efficacy of those strategies. All any of the authentication technologies can do is confirm that this is probably the same user it was last time. Authentication technologies are agnostic as to any particular identity. All assume the underlying principle that one identity equals one person. This assumption is not only not true, it is dangerous. We are all aware of insta
nces in which one person was using many identities and we are equally aware of instances in which many individuals are using one identity. In both of these instances authentication fails, unless the correct single identity is associated with the authentication methodology at the outset.
There is no barrier from me attaching my finger image to Bill Gates' identity.
