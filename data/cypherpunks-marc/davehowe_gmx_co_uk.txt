Is it possible to be sick of crypto on this list? :)
Indeed so. It really needs to be remembered that the Bernstein paper was a
grant proposal, for monies to research if this could be made practical; so
if it is practical, and gives a speed saving at practical (~1024 bit) sizes,
*and* setup overhead doesn't swamp speed gain, then two-three years from now
it could be a viable attack engine design.
On the other hand, I would be surprised if a custom machine to break 1024
bit RSA or DH couldn't be built within the next decade, so a key upgrade
from that to (say) 2048 is probably due anyhow; a lot depends on your threat
model. I would be willing to wager a medium sized sum (if it could be
determined anyhow ;) that the NSA could break at least one 1024 bit key per
year within the next four years (if not already). I would imagine a large
corporate/criminal organisation would need more than a decade before it
became practical (ie, expected returns exceeded cost). as my threat model
doesn't include even a medium corporate caring what I write, I should be
safe enough (but my keys are 4K anyhow :)
Odd - I was told that the Bernstein machine would be effective against DH
keys too - is that in error? (I admit my math isn't good enough to check

Indeed my point (the mentioned hardware implimentation limitations) -
however, you don't need an infinite pi - a prng based on a subset that has
2^257 bits of the sequence has by definition a longer cycle time than a 256
state prng.
which is why a subset is sufficient.

@_subject: Re: Two ideas for random number generation 
I think there is some confusion here - if you are using a PRNG as a stream
cypher, the last thing in the world you want is for it to be truely random -
you need to sync up two prngs in order to decrypt the message, and
randomness would defeat that (I can see a case where you introduce a little
randomness and use some redundant method to strip it out before encryption,
but that's only a second layer of obscurity of little value if the
mainstream crypto is borken.
if you want random numbers, get a rng - a prng is never going to be a rng,
and everyone knows it. given you are using a prng in any case, does it
matter if the prng sequence being used happens to be a sequence of pi, or
any other fixed sequence?
indeed so. but if someone has said a prng is truely a rng, I must have
missed it.
what makes you think the offset is a fixed width? pi is of infinite length
(or so I am told) so any offset is also at least potentially of infinite
size. speed and physical construction constraints limit that, but not enough
to fit your claims of it being easily defeatable.
its probably a better (if much slower) stream cypher than most currently in
use; I can't think of any that have larger than a 256 internal state, and
that implies a 2^256 step cycle at best; for pi to be worse, it would have
to have less than 2^256 digits.
no, you are using a subset of a pseudo-random stream of infinite length;
there is little benefit in selecting digits at random, if you are relying on
the pseudorandomness of the stream itself.  I am at a loss to see what you
are driving at, so am forced to assume we are considering radically
different cases.

PRNG output is fixed/repeatable too - that is a properly you *want* from a
PRNG.  any subset of the digits of pi is as close to RNG output as you would
need to satisfy any entropy tests - unless you *knew* you had derived it
from pi you couldn't distinguish it from a true random string of the same
*shrug* given that adding a bit to the seed doubles the quantity of data
they would have to cache in their tables, it can quickly become unworkable;
the single-digit-of-pi formula is too slow to form a good stream cypher, but
is otherwise ok; if you aren't constrained to matching a real world sequence
(pi in this case) but are happy with *any* non-repeating but deterministic
stream, you can probably find something much faster.

There is a balance to be had here. it should be impossible for a random

to a pc that has been left logged on (but which hasn't been used to sign
documents for five minutes or so) and sign a document; it should be easy
for the user to sign a large number of documents in rapid succession,
without having to type in a complex password every single time. If this
involves remembering the password for a specified "idle" time, or using
a smartcard to auth (rather than a manual password or in addition) that
the user can remove when he takes a coffee break then fine - but
whatever you do must almost certainly use no other hardware than is
already fitted to the machine, so a usb dongle could be ok for a home

single link of a transmission chain, with no control over the rest of
the chain.
Signing has a limited application - I wouldn't use it routinely other
than to establish an association (key-->poster) early in a conversation,
and then omit it except for things whose source *I* would want verified
if I was receiving it.
It is unusual for me to use a sig outside of encrypt+sign.
Depends on the definition of "know". If a poster had a regular habit of
posting at least one signed message every week, and had never protested
that the sigs were faked, then you could assume that the poster whose
sig just cleared is the same as the poster who has been posting for that

Its a nice idea, but unfortunately gets easily bitten by the usual

1. large wifi networks start to hit scaling problems - they start to need
routers and name services that are relatively expensive, and ip address
ranges start to become a scarce resource.
2. no matter how large the new network becomes, it still needs a link to the
"old" network; almost all ISPs frown on use of home connections for sharing
more than just the owner's machines, and many consider using even unmetered
in a manner they didn't provision for (ie, using unmetered more than 100
hours a month at the full bandwidth limit) as "abuse" and end the contracts
of those who do so. what you would need would be an ISP (or large
commercial) style contract with a guaranteeed bandwidth and dedicated ip
addresses - which do not come cheap enough to be worth giving away.
3. unmetered is only just becoming common in england, and is still mostly on
56K modem. broadband is often *massively* underprovisioned, and quite often
all the connections in an area feed to a single fixed-bandwidth multiplexor
at the telecomms office, so adding additional connections doesn't actually
add any bandwidth at all. the *only* end user deal is 500kb down, 250kb up
shared amongst *50* people in your area (the uk has a telecomms monopoly
from a recently privatised company that has already forced two would-be

I don't understand why this concept is so difficult for you - software
*must* perform the mount; there is absolutely no way you could
personally inspect every byte from the disk and pass decrypted data to
the os at line speed yourself.  lilo is the actor here.  If you gave a
program spec to a programmer and said "write this" you wouldn't be able
to claim you wrote the code yourself, no matter how good or essential
the program spec was.
you couldn't *mount* a disk in hardware; you *could* decrypt on-the-fly
and make the physical disk look like a unencrypted one, but you would
still need non-crypto software to mount it.
no, you can't. data from the hardware is *still* encrypted; only the
output of the driver is decrypted, and a machine no longer running
bootstrap or os is also incapable of decryption. you *could*, if good
enough, place the processor in a halt state and use DMA to modify the
code to reveal the plaintext, but it would be a major pain to do so and
would require both physical access to the machine *while powered up and
without triggering any anti-tamper switches* after the password has been
supplied. This is actually a weakness in firmware cryptodrives (as I
have seen advertised recently) - once the drive is "unlocked" it can
usually be swapped over to another machine and the plaintext read.
Indeed so, yes. however, usually that decision has to be made before the
password would be entered - so making more awkward. you *could* finangle
the bootstrap though; there must *always* be part of the code outside
the crypto envelope (but of course this can be removable media such as
the usb drive mentioned, and stored securely when not in use)
indeed so. however, if that applied to machines not already running, the
police wouldn't be so upset when they find encrypted files on seized

no, lilo is. if you you can mount a pgpdisk (say) without software, then you
are obviously much more talented than I am :)
for virtual drives, the real question is at what point in the boot process
you can mount a drive - if it is not until the os is fully functional, then
you are unable to protect the os itself. if the bootstrap process can mount
the drive before the os is functional, then you *can* protect the os. Win9x
uses dos as its bootstrap (and drivespace gives a good example of a virtual
drive system that can hand over to a 32bit driver as the os starts). lilo
*could* kick a virtual drive into existence during the kernel boot, given
such a driver and some patches to both kernel and lilo itself.  that it
would need a password from somewhere during this process is both obvious and
not a major issue.

not if you have to type it every time.
if you take that as criteria, then *all* encryption is moot, as I can't
think of any you don't have to supply a key or passphrase for.
you could also have lilo look at a dongle (a usb drive, say) for its key.

Not always - certainly, windows cache goes to a partition that must be
available at windows startup - but webbrowser cache can happily live on an
encrypted disk (I have done this many times)
Further, there is always the Drivecrypt pluspack which mounts an encrypted
volume before windoze starts, and hands over to windoze as it comes up (I
believe the same mechanism is used as for doublespaced drives, but I can't
be sure; drivecrypt is closed source, hence I refuse to use it)
At least in theory a lilo boot could mount an encrypted partition while
still in the initrd stage; as crypto support is moved into the kernel, I
expect to see this become an available option.

The problem is here, we are blaming the protective device for not being able
to protect against the deliberate use of an attack that bypasses, not
challenges it - by exploiting the gullibility or tendency to take the path
of least resistance of the user.
The real weakness in HTTPS is the tendency of certificates signed by Big
Name CAs to be automagically trusted - even if you have never visited that
site before.  yes, you can fix this almost immediately by untrusting the
root certificate - but then you have to manually verify each and every site
at least once, and possibly every time if you don't mark the cert as
"trusted" for future reference.
To blame HTTPS for an attack where the user fills in a web form received via
html-rendering email (no https involved at all) is more than a little unfair
I am not aware of one (not that that means much, given I am a novice in this
Even PKI relies on something close to a shared secret - a *trustworthy* copy
of the public key, matching a secret copy of the private key. In x509, this
trustworthyness is established by an Ultimately Trusted CA; in pgp, by the
Web Of Trust, in a chain leading back to your own key; in SSH, by your
placing of the public key into your home dir manually (using some other form
of authentication to presumably gain access)
in each of these cases, the private key will almost invariably be protected
by a passphrase; at best, you can have a single passphrase (or even single
private key) to cover all bases.. but that just makes that secret all the
more valuable.
That is pretty much because defence occupies the position of the interior -
attackers will almost invariably attack weak points, not strong ones. It is
easy to log and calculate how many attacks happen on weak points, but
impossible to calculate how many attacks *would* have happened had the
system not been in place to protect against such attacks, so the attackers
moved onto easier targets.
It makes little sense to try and break one https connection (even at 40 bit)
if by breaking into the server you get that information, hundreds of others
(until discovered) and possibly thousands of others inadvisedly stored
unprotected in a database.
Which again matches well to the Nigerian analogy. Everyone *knows* that

opposed to introduction of ID Cards is here:
  Note that the preferred path is now to update passport and driving
licence documents (at the citizen's expense) to include digital ID and
biometric information; once 80% of citizens have been forced to accept ID
cards by this backdoor process (no parlimentary debate required) it will
seem only a small step to force the remaining 20% to purchase such a card.
There will apparently not be any compulsion to *carry* the card (at this
stage) but it will be required to be produced to obtain access to
government controlled services such as healthcare....

There was a payware (but disclosed source) update for NT/2K, and of course
E4M (on which the NT driver for scramdisk was based) was always NT
compatable and very similar to Scramdisk. I don't think either works on XP
though (and of course DriveCrypt by the authors of both scramdisk and E4M
is both closed source and product activation - a dark path to walk)
E4M can still be downloaded from
IIRC E4M could also mount existing scramdisks, but had trouble dismounting
them cleanly on W2K.

*shrug* it doesn't retroactively enforce the safety net - but that's ok,
most MS products don't either :)
note what it is saying here is that if you *have* a cert signed by a non-CA
key/cert pair, it will still display the chain - not that you can use a
non-ca key/cert pair to sign with (which is another issue; writing software
to sign using non-ca key/cert pairs is trivial though)
XCA enforces the basic constraint for keysigning, just is more lax while
displaying chains.
nor is there any with OpenSSL - there is revocation list management (which
is more than some commercial CA software in this area provides, and more
than Thawte even bothers to offer :)
Key management and auditing is pretty much external to the actual software
regardless of which solution you use I would have thought. Your rituals are
equally applicable to xca - just the nature of the tool (a pretty gui rather
than a command line exe, script and some config files) has changed.
two level independent CA is possible, by having more than one XCA database.
the location of the database can be specified to be on removable media
(which simplifies things quite a bit :)
assuming you have two databases (a:\master.db and c:\level1.db) just create
two shortcuts to xca with each db passed as a command line parameter - or if
you want to keep *both* on more reliable removable media (say, a thumbdrive)
you could arrange for the autorun.ini on each to automagically launch XCA
when inserted into a usb slot, running xca directly from the thumbdrive (so
no footprint at all on the machine) - this is trival to do with a little bit
of vbscript or batchfile scripting
you could also (if it makes you feel more secure) use Openssl for the root
certificate (which after all doesn't see much use) and XCA for day-to-day
issuing of keys, but there seems little or no reason to do so.
Personally, I keep my XCA databases in scramdisks.

No, they don't.
  Fox news repeats this enough that more than half of america believes it,

  The rules are considerably more lax for the defenders than the
attackers - if you are entering another country, then you must either be
part of a uniformed, standing army or be part of a militia (with a rigid
authority structure, open carrage of arms and an identifying badge or
emblem). You must also respect the rules of war - so at least in theory,
even a uniformed "official" combatant is not entitled to the protections
of the Geneva conventions if he himself breaks those conventions (by e.g.
shooting noncombatants)
  If you are defending though, you are entitled to the protection of the
geneva convention (and lawful combatant status) simply by being an "open"
hostile (carrying your weaponry openly and obeying all the usual
provisions of the geneva convention, which obviously doesn't allow hiding
in a crowd of civilians). This is the "take up arms" provision so beloved
of the american people - that in the face of invasion, the ordinary
citizen would "take up arms" to defend his home and neighbours.
  There is considerable doubt as to exactly how this applies to sniping -
certainly, uniformed combatants are little less likely to decide to dive
into cover and "take out" their opponents with aimed fire than random
undertrained militia are, and it would be insane for a lone "take up arms"
defender to stand out in the open to "duke it out"; the problem is a
random sniper is difficult to locate *after* an attack if he is not
otherwise identifiable; ok, he isn't permitted to drop his weapon and
retain his lawful combatant status, but nor could a uniformed individual
(one of several) be expected to volunteer that he was the one who just
killed four of the team now pointing weapons at him..... (the "take up

firing until he is killed, captured, or he wins :)

Abstract: WinZip is a popular compression utility for Microsoft Windows
computers, the latest version of which is advertised as having
"easy-to-use AES encryption to protect your sensitive data." We exhibit
several attacks against WinZip's new encryption method, dubbed "AE-2" or
"Advanced Encryption, version two." We then discuss secure alternatives.
Since at a high level the underlying WinZip encryption method appears
secure (the core is exactly Encrypt-then-Authenticate using AES-CTR and
HMAC-SHA1), and since one of our attacks was made possible because of the
way that WinZip Computing, Inc.~decided to fix a different security
problem with its previous encryption method AE-1, our attacks further
underscore the subtlety of designing cryptographically secure software.

PGPfone had that problem, even over landlines (no IP involved) - however, I think that was more do to with the compression codecs and the crypto than any external problems, as switching to half-duplex usually cleared the problems up.

IIRC, PGPfone ( did something similar, with a "verbal handshake" protocol that relied on you being able to recognise the remote party's voice over the phone while speaking a list of words.... always seemed both unreliable and odd in something with "PGP" in the name, but....
Raw data streams would be fine over a point to point modem link - but I can see an advantage to compartmentalization - you can break your secure phone problem down into two distinct subproblems
a) establishing a secure IP VPN between two nodes
b) optimizing VoIP for low bandwidth links
I would add a third - a modem protocol based on something like CSMA/CD to allow conference calls to be used as carrier media for secure conversations, but that is too hairy for me :)
Something like OpenVPN ( seems ideal for the secure VPN part of the problem, but requires an underlying IP network.... the VoIP part of the problem has a embarrassment of riches; H323 used to come as standard with windows, in the form of Netmeeting (complete with videoconferencing and whiteboarding) and SIP is now part of Windows XP (a not-particuarly-well-documented) "feature" of windows messager. There are many, many more, and Asterix (sadly not particularly well known, and unix only) is a complete, open source PBX which is conventional telephony, SIP and H323 aware.
OpenVPN is of course built on SSL, and can use either X509 certificates or a preshared key for authentication. Sadly, there is no convenient way to use DNS-SEC key records for OpenVPN.

Unless someone has come up with a new wrinkle to this since I last looked, the QKE system indeed requires three channels - the key photon one which must be optical, and a conventional comms pair (the latter of course can be substituted with any comms pair you have handy, but if you are running fibre from A to B you might as well run three)
As all three require MiTM to be mounted, it would be better to have a physically diverse path for the conventional pair - but in a small city where you are patching the optical channel though the nearest exchange, this may not be practicable.

   That was poor design; however, similar emplacements would presumably be fairly economic to produce, and would have the added feature of making it hard for the repair vessels to trawl up the cable for repairs if there were still existing blocks pinning it down in the area they are attempting to lift cable. making the downward facing edge deliberately a curved blade is an obvious "improvement" to the design, and could actually be helped by attempts to repair the cable - tug up the cable against the block, and have it severed *again* at the point you are attempting to trawl up (at which juncture, the severed end will slip out of your hook and back to the ocean floor). Given even half hearted timing, you could place the blocks weeks or even months before, meaning nobody could easily trace back your presence in the area to the time of the "event".

However neither do they jump at blaming terrorist acts or bungled spying - in the former case, the results/cost of a cut is sufficiently detached from anyone terrorists would really want to influence that it is unlikely, and in the latter, it is assumed that anyone with the technical capabilities to tap a submarine cable at those depths is sufficiently competent to not leave it in two pieces afterwards. Nor is this an anticipated increase due to the age or number of cables.
   I would however not be surprised if it was a result of some fishing fleet coming up with a "new and improved" way of dragging a huge net behind themselves to scoop up fish, which involved dragging heavy weights behind the net on the ocean floor that could get caught on cables - they certainly aren't going to admit to it and take the financial hit of being held responsible for the repair costs.

Any good methodology, be it technological, cryptographic, or procedural,

and elements which need not be. Disclosing the latter makes it easier to
get peer review, encourages other people to use the same methodologies
(which at worst increases the value of a break to an attacker, and at
best allows the original poster's traffic to be "lost in the noise"

their own sausages - because the requirements for documenting and
providing the ingredients for each "product" apply to that, and it is
not economically viable to go though that process when they can instead
buy a standard "mix" from a supplier, add a specified weight of
specified meats, and then use the supplier's pre-certified documentation
and ingredients list.
Does that protect us against rogue food providers? possibly. Does it
stop my (formerly award winning) butcher from selling me a superior
product instead of the standardized one? yes, it does.
On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog.
On your website, nobody can tell if you are or aren't really BigBank,
BigBoxShifter, or BigManufacturer; there is therefore a market for
certifying this, and the current climate (where you get to choose in a
competitive market which lizard you select, but must select a lizard) is
a viable approach; however, its plainly biassed in favour of the current
incumbents, who have a vested interest in keeping prices high and
consolidating against outsiders.
A distributed model would be good, but even leaving aside key
distribution issues for your trusted recommenders, it means that you are
basing your own trust decision on two things - one, that the person
certifying the site is himself trustworthy, and two, that the process
was not compromised (if I wished to establish a scam site, and a
distributed model was in place, the first few transactions would be
*amazingly* honest and I would take pains to get those first few
certifications well established... then fight tooth and nail to hang on
to them and prevent any revocation being posted, no matter how many
other people I scammed based on the mistaken trust assertion made by the
early visitors.)
Or could be badly advised as to the trustworthyness of some of her
couriers - because she herself doesn't know if a particular supplicant
is honest and trustworthy, so must rely on others to assert that to her.
But in essence, even if you have a lot of trustworthy friends, whose
online community of interest is similar to yours, you are going to have
to be first visitor to at least some of the sites - and the trust
decision is then going to have to be made by you based on something
other than the distributed network.
The future will *always* have lusers. It's in the nature of the system -
spam and phishing scams would not exist if there wasn't a profitable
minority who believe that yes, there *is* a Nigerian out there who
wishes to give them 6 million dollars, and all he needs is their bank
details... that 90%+ of all email is now of this type just shows there
is a profit to be made from the gullible being gullible. All attempts to
"do something" about this will not make the gullible any safer, but will
restrict what *you* can do without the permission of the state. Laws
are, for the most part, to force the law abiding to not do things the
scofflaws will ignore anyhow, even if the law abiding previously had a
legitimate reason to do so.

They can. There is the revocation issue (once a certificate passes its
validity date, they no longer need to store a revocation for it if it
was revoked; for one and two year certificates that is only one or two
years, but if it were longer than that the CRL would be correspondingly
larger. certificates can *specify* where the CRL is, giving a mechanism
to assign a different URL to each year's offerings, but surprisingly,
many of the older CAs don't use it and rely on the browser having
hard-coded data for the CRL.
I think it is more that most sites don't want to pay that sort of cash
up front for their cert - with the current crop of EV certificates
exceeding  a 10 year cert would be in excess of  and a 20
year 9K or more. even with a discount, that's a *lot* of upfront cost
for a business.
Another factor is that prices for normal certificates have been steadily
declining, year on year, for some time now - even given that money *now*
is worth more than money this time next year, if the cert is going to be
cheaper next year in absolute terms, you would be ill advised to to buy
too many years up front at the higher price.
EV is another good example of a factor; it didn't exist a few years ago,
now it is a "must have" for big name sites. What will the next big thing
be five years from now, and would it mean discarding your expensive 10
year certificate for the new and more secure "we really really check you
are who you claim to be, this time, honest" Super EV that is then
considered a requirement?
Finally, will you still be called the same thing ten years from now?
companies change, their branding (and corporate image) changes, they
merge and split; you may not wish to have five more years as
 if you no longer make widgets, and your company name
has changed to megagadget...
still a lot of one year certs out there - bigger sites may find the
trouble of renewal on what is only a small difference in price an issue,
and thus go with a longer certificate, but the default for most
purchases is the One year cert. But regardless - the whole pricing
structure of the CA market is commercial - certificates exist *only* to
make money for commercial CAs; any actual security benefit is a side effect.
Because it doesn't.
the vast majority of browsers don't report a certificate that has
changed since your last visit - because they don't keep a copy of the
certificate to verify against. Those that do have been specifically
modified for that purpose by their users - as is detailed in this
thread, pretty much - and suffer from the first visit problem because
there is no mechanism to say "if it is a cert I don't have, verify it
against the CA, tell me which CA it is (and if that seems a sane choice)
and then store a copy so next time I have my own standard to refer to".
There is also no mechanism to chain from a trusted certificate that is
due to expire (or already has) to a new, not yet verified one. But then,
there is no commercial incentive for either of these features, as
browsers are happy to support the commercial CA model, and certainly the
commercial CAs don't want anyone to leave the hierarchical "CA as god"
You should be able to check the certificate chain on the object and see.
I haven't tried this (and given its 1am I am not going to now, but I may
do so when I get time :)

Sadly, their implementation underwhelms me - plus it threatens a *very*
profitable (and convenient to TLAs) status quo, which only goes well if
you can get both community and vendor support.

Its a nice theory, but doesn't cover first-visit scenarios, nor the
yearly rekey grind of giving CAs (large amounts of) money for the
results of a fairly easy math problem.
What I would prefer is some parallel system where person 'x', who I
trust, may or may not have visited site 'y', and may or may not have
signed the then certificate, the signature for which (with its date of
providence) is then stored *on the site* for me to access though a
well-known url. That way, I can look with suspicion at sites which do
not have such a certificate, investigate myself if they are serving the
certificate I am expecting to see (and how do I do that? I have tried in
the past phoning companies to obtain their website public key for
independent verification; most don't know what one is, a few have even
said they can't disclose that as it is *priviledged information*....)
But, who do I trust for that, who do *you* trust for that, and will
those people be wiling to give up a significant slice of time every year
revisiting websites after their certificates are renewed, and facing the
same hurdles I did (the complete ignorance of most companies as to how
their websites' certificate works and unwillingness to supply an
accurate fingerprint over the phone).

@_subject: Re: fingerprinting traffic at ISP for big content 
Its complex. the surprising and short answer is - bit torrent traffic
does not have *any* file names; the torrent descriptor file contains the
file layout, individual file hashes, and an overall hash that is used to
reference the torrent in communications (in fact, no torrent client will
talk to you unless you reference a file hash it is currently holding
"live", either for download or seeding).
Alternative distributed peer locating systems and "trackerless" cloud
torrents have a secondary system for handling this information, but move
the actual data using the torrent protocols. You also get "private"
trackers, who require a unique registered token per registered user
before they will share peer information. Most of these prohibit
alternative peer finding mechanisms, which is good, but conversely also
track which torrents users have uploaded and how much (in bytes) which,
given those logs are kept, is potentially a goldmine for anyone wishing
to link interest in a given file to a list of people who have
"distributed" it in part or whole.

@_subject: Re: Money in a closed ecosystem 
I disagree. While the total value of the system compared to the external
world can indeed grow (and be balanced by an outflow of some saleable
resource, either physical or not) the amount of needed in-circulation
cash is going to be pretty close to constant, if you can disregard
you still need a bank - people will need to exchange the non-physical
value of their wages for physical tokens (cash) and will spend those at
retail for food, clothing etc. a certain amount will remain in the bank
(as savings) or be transferred electronically for mail order goods)
however, all money spent at retail will be in the cash registers of the
retailers who will invariably then take at least some of it to the bank,
to be credited to their account. This account will then be used to pay
wages (for their own workers) and buy in fresh supplies of resources
(electronically). Some will no doubt skip this step, and issue wages
from receipts and buy some materiel in cash (so freshly caught raw meat,
etc) but that doesn't cause the cash to leave the system - its new
owners will either spend it at retail or bank it, thus recycling the
tokens they have.
no matter how you look at it, the amount in people's wallets won't vary
that much, and once spent, will either be placed in other people's
wallets, or in the bank (where it can be re-issued to the people who
spent it in the first place). The only reasons you can need new physical
tokens in the system are inflation (items are costing more, so the
amount of in-wallet cash you need to carry is larger), physical tokens
are leaving the system - so, raw materiel bought in cash from outside
the system, people leaving Antarctica and taking cash with them - or if
the number of people in the system is increasing, which of course is

I am expecting a future version to automate some of that - TC, great
