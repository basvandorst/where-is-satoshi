It's my pah-ty, I can whine if I want to. BTW, how does pointing

I know. The point, which you missed, was RAH sending a shortened URL.
If RAH wants to send URLs like that, he can. But he damages his own
cypherpunk street cred, with each shortened URL. Because with that
shorty URL, he makes you and me engage in labor we should not have
to engage in, if only he had sent the real (target) URL instead.
The question we need to be asking ourselves, why on earth did RAH
go to the extra effort of creating that short URL in the first
place? He's a veteran of this list, what is his angle? Or the angle
of whatever it is that has its whole arm up his ass, if he really
can't defend himself. Which he hasn't, yet. Tim May can't be blamed
for short URLs.
Do you get it now?
Even then, bit.ly or shor.ty or as.sy are not guaranteed to be
available in 1, 5, 10 years. Example? Shurl.com and yes, it did
used to exist: Can you hear me now/yet? WOULD IT HELP IF I SHOUTED?
Yes, no, and you lose. His shorty URL caused you to engage in labor
you should not have had to engage in - and you were probably exposed
to ads - or links to ads, as a result.
When will strong encryption be baked into email clients, so that
discussions like this are not necessary anymore?
And, your demimed email client sucks too.

It is only available bundled together with tv and internet service and

the above. Which basically means the copper that was used years ago is
now unused and growing verdigris where it hasn't been ripped out already.
Consequently, I had to do something I hadn't wanted to otherwise, get

The phenomenon would seem to be a hallmark of poor design. The system
should keep track of what went where and automatically delete it unless
prevented from doing so. That was certainly the case with the systems
and data I have personal experience with, poor design leading to
irresponsible retention of user financial (credit card) data in particular.

Which makes it no different from how telephone networks worked for
decades, in the pre-Caller ID dayze.
Time was, users were encouraged to contact the phone company immediately
after receiving prank, etc., calls. There is still no legitimate reason
to retain that data more than 90 days, if that long. Make it available
to the individual users and it is their responsibility to keep it, if
they want it. Feds stymied by that? It's because the victim on behalf
of whom they want to prosecute didn't keep records. Oops.

liberate that data in the manner it should have been liberated in

even inconsequential to the real central principle here.

Secrets, lies and Snowden's email: why I was forced to shut down Lavabit
For the first time, the founder of an encrypted email startup that was supposed to insure privacy for all reveals how the FBI and the US legal system made sure we don't have the right to much privacy in the first place
By Ladar Levison
May 20 2014
My legal saga started last summer with a knock at the door, behind which stood two federal agents ready to to serve me with a court order requiring the installation of surveillance equipment on my company's network.
My company, Lavabit, provided email services to 410,000 people ­ including Edward Snowden, according to news reports ­ and thrived by offering features specifically designed to protect the privacy and security of its customers. I had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device, which would hand the US government access to all of the messages ­ to and from all of my customers ­ as they travelled between their email accounts other providers on the Internet.
But that wasn't enough. The federal agents then claimed that their court order required me to surrender my company's private encryption keys, and I balked. What they said they needed were customer passwords ­ which were sent securely ­ so that they could access the plain-text versions of messages from customers using my company's encrypted storage feature. (The government would later claim they only made this demand because of my "noncompliance".)
Bothered by what the agents were saying, I informed them that I would first need to read the order they had just delivered ­ and then consult with an attorney. The feds seemed surprised by my hesitation.
What ensued was a flurry of legal proceedings that would last 38 days, ending not only my startup but also destroying, bit by bit, the very principle upon which I founded it ­ that we all have a right to personal privacy.
In the first two weeks, I was served legal papers a total of seven times and was in contact with the FBI every other day. (This was the period a prosecutor would later characterize as my "period of silence".) It took a week for me to identify an attorney who could adequately represent me, given the complex technological and legal issues involved ­ and we were in contact for less than a day when agents served me with a summons ordering me to appear in a Virginia courtroom, over 1,000 miles from my home. Two days later, I was served the first subpoena for the encryption keys.
With such short notice, my first attorney was unable to appear alongside me in court. Because the whole case was under seal, I couldn't even admit to anyone who wasn't an attorney that I needed a lawyer, let alone why. In the days before my appearance, I would spend hours repeating the facts of the case to a dozen attorneys, as I sought someone else that was qualified to represent me. I also discovered that as a third party in a federal criminal indictment, I had no right to counsel. After all, only my property was in jeopardy ­ not my liberty. Finally, I was forced to choose between appearing alone or facing a bench warrant for my arrest.
In Virginia, the government replaced its encryption key subpoena with a search warrant and a new court date. I retained a small, local law firm before I went back to my home state, which was then forced to assemble a legal strategy and file briefs in just a few short days. The court barred them from consulting outside experts about either the statutes or the technology involved in the case. The court didn't even deliver transcripts of my first appearance to my own lawyers for two months, and forced them to proceed without access to the information they needed.
Then, a federal judge entered an order of contempt against me ­ without even so much as a hearing.
