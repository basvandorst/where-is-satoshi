My understanding of this is that it renders the core code (that subject to
PCR hashing) unpatchable, because if you ever change it you lose all your
secured data.
I find that surprising, as it renders them kind of useless for
"protecting" audio. Do you know how this relates to the "Secure Audio
Path" idea which was big last year?
The "trusted worm" idea appeals to me; I've been kicking various versions
of it around on mailing lists for a while now. Until I see a NGSCB machine
I don't know exactly how it will work. Even if you can't create your own
secure area, it should be possible to exploit someone else's, e.g. by
buffer overrunning Windows Media Player. That would let you use its Super
Sekrit Music Vault (or whatever) to store stuff where the user can't get
at it.
The proposed Office document encryption and revocation features sound like
fun. It could be the great extortion opportunity of the future - "We've
taken all your document master keys. Send us $1000 if you ever want to see
them again."
