The Samsung HC-P4252W projection HDTV monitor is designed for those who are looking to transform a medium-sized room into a home theater. Its 42 inch widescreen viewing area is set in a smart-looking, compact table top design, making it the perfect choice for big screen for those replacing a 32 to 36 inch direct view TV. At the heart of the set, Samsung's RealFlect?video system drives high contrast, robust colors and inviting detail. TheAuto Self Focus?autoconvergence system corrects picture focus at a push of a button. Flicker-free progressive scan picture conversion of analog video sources eliminates scan lines visible in previous designs of projection TVs. The 40-watt stereo audio system delivers ample sound for sports and movies.  Your email address is cypherpunks
