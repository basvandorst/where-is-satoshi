You write it exactly as you say: 0.0.0.16/0.0.0.240.
Of course, this only works for ranges that sit on natural power-of-two
boundaries. There is no single-rule mechanism in standard iptables
which lets you match an arbitrary IP address range.
If you need that, have a look at the patch-o-matic ippool patch, which
allows definition of pools with arbitrary bounds; you then use the pool
name in a single rule line in iptables. However, be aware that the current
ippool code provides only a "bitmap" pool type, which costs you 1 bit of
kernel memory for each IP address in the range. These bits can then be
used to individually include or exclude single IP addresses within the
range - but they are pure overhead if all you want is the bounds check.
hope this helps
