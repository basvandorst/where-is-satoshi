Is your gmail account attached to a phone number? Did gmail ever make you
do that when you originally signed up?

Running an exit node from home DSL or Cable is bad idea. One must look
for a Tor friendly ISP and have balls made of steel!

perhaps we can ask William for his exit node fingerprint or IP to verify?
I'd like to make a donation if I can confirm the message.

I'm hoping to collect a good collection of cypherpunks material in time.
Suggestions are appreciated.

I'd say they are referring to some kind of protocol, network or application
For example, all connections to standard VPN ports.

For example, In Iran which is funny how its mentioned in slide 16, weak
encryption is common.  Most VPN providers sell PPTP with MSCHAP (thanks to
the built in windows client) which I think is as weak as the password set.
Three VPN logins are being emailed from providers to users in plain text.
It can't be too difficult for NSA or anyone analyzing the traffic to
decrypt the VPN content.
