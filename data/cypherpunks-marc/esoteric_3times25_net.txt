As I've noted on other lists, it's quite likely that the person the email APPEARS to be coming from is not infected.  Many of these viri now spoof the sending address.  I've received viri with a sending email of my own address.  I don't run any windows boxes.  All it takes is for someone to have your email address in their outlook address book.  They are infected, and the viri sends email out using the address from that outlook address box.
