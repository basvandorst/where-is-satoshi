decay of families, divorce, illegitimacy, loss of authority,
multiculturalism, alternative lifestyles, social disintegration, sex,
and crime. All of these phenomena represent anomalies and scandalous
deviations from the natural order. Did this not imply that vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, drug use,
promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, homosexuality, polygamy,
pedophilia or any other conceivable perversity or abnormality, insofar
as they were victimless crimes, were no offenses at all but perfectly
normal and legitimate activities and lifestyles?
requirements for entering specific pieces of property (for example, no
beggars, bums, or homeless, but also no homosexuals, drug users, Jews,
Moslems, Germans, or Zulus), and those who did not meet these entrance
requirements would be kicked out as trespassers. Almost instantly,

Searching for the term "Big Business" in the original cpunks archive I found the below quoted discussion. It's pretty interesting because it deals with chaum, closed source hardware...and all the usual stuff. And notice the screeching noises that metzger makes when Hughes doesn't toe the corporatist party line. As to metzger, the guy is a typical fake libertarian and true fascist with a german sounding surname, so I'd bet a couple of cents he belongs to the jooish master race. And funnily enough, it turns out that metzger used to use this address  - yep! that's the arch jew thieves lehman brothers. So a corporate fascist at lehman brothers hates cryptocurrencies while posing as 'libertarian'? Who would have thought that...
1 ------
A lot of our discussion is influenced by the ideas of David Chaum.  He
pioneered technology which could protect individual privacy while allowing
very flexible sorts of credentials and guarantees.  He has also played
a big role in the various proposals for digital cash.
But I think that Chaum has gone off in the wrong direction in the last
few years.  More and more he is concentrating on protocols which rely
on a tamper-proof, hardware implementation of a cryptographic protocol
which he calls an "observer".  This observer chip would sit in your
computer (which could be a Newton-style PDA or a smart card) and would
play an important part in the exchanges of information, cash, or credentials
which you would make with others.  The observer basically makes sure you
are telling the truth in your transactions, that you are not double-spending
your digital cash, or not claiming a credential which you don't have.
Now, this approach has the obvious advantage that it allows solving
certain problems which can't be solved otherwise.  There appears to be
no way to provide for secure, off-line digital cash, for example, other
than with something like an observer.
But it has the equally obvious problem of relying on a tamper-proof
chip as a necessary part of the protocol.  Recently it seems that many
of the papers out of his group are designed to explore observer-based
protocols.  This means that these ideas are not useful for software-only
implementations.  One of the (relatively few) strengths that we and the
forces we represent have is that free software can be spread very far
and very fast, making it hard for those opposed to privacy to successfully
stop our efforts.  Any technology based on special chips is going to
lose these advantages.
Another problem with the observer is psychological.  Although Chaum goes
to great lengths to design his cryptographic protocols so that even a
cheating observer can learn effectively NOTHING about the computer user
that would compromise his privacy, people may still feel uncomfortable
about having a mechanical "conscience" in their pocket.  People want to
feel in control of their computers, and I think supporting this control
is a big part of the Cypherpunks philosophy.
A related point is that there have already been comparisons on sci.crypt
between Chaum's observers and the Clipper chip, in that both rely on
tamper-resistant technology to implement features which are not entirely
in their owner's best interests.  Assuming we do manage to successfully
defeat Clipper, the taint of this association may increase resistance to
I wish Chaum and his group would stop directing their efforts towards
protocols which require an observer chip to be effective.  Granted,
there are some things that don't work as nicely without observers.  But
I think that a realistic appraisal of the pros and cons suggests that
non-observer protocols are more likely to further our ultimate goal of
personal privacy.
Hal Finney
2 ------
There is no silver bullet!
Here are some comments about why there are no easy to use "digital
coins," and why the digital money protocols are so complicated and
involve banks, tamper-resistant modules, and other things that may not
be make difficult some of our Cypherpunks goals.
I agree with Hal Finney's basic point about David Chaum's current
direction: it is not precisely the direction I'd like to see.
However, in Chaum's defense, his is only one group and can only do so
much. I don't see other groups pursuing digital cash with the same
vigor and depth, save for the occasional paper about "electronic
wallets" and so forth, and so Chaum is doing what he is doing.
It is possible that someone here in Cypherpunks will develop some form
of competing system. (Bear in mind, though, that these protocols are
notoriously complicated, and involve issues of forgery, spoofing,
denial (that a transaction occurred), tax laws, and so on.)
One of Hal's points deserves special comment:
(speaking of the observer protocol)
There are no digital coins.
A physical piece of gold, the canonical piece of money, is essentially
imposssible to counterfeit/forge, so coins can be passed from person
to person, person to shop, to banks, to tax collectors, etc. It is the
ultimate "bearer instrument." Importantly, the flow of such money is
"conservative" in that the total amount of such money is constant...no
amount of trickery or protocol complexity can increase the amount
present, and only loss of the physical coins can reduce the amount.
Paper currency is ostensibly a parallel to physical money (at least in
countries on a gold or silver standard, which the U.S. is not any
longer). Strong currencies (DM, yen, dollar, SF...though this is all
debatable) still have some of the "conservative" nature, because the
bills/notes are very difficult to counterfeit and are exchanged as
physical items or tokens.
I won't get into things like VISA transactions, promissory notes,
etc., except to say they are quite a bit less "tangible" (anyone who
has gotten unexpected VISA transactions, triggered by someone out
there, understands that the transactions are much less straightforward
and tangible). A problem with digital money has always been that there apparently is
no close equivalent to a digital coin, a token which can be passed
around freely, as a quarter or a dollar bill can be.
The reasons are obvious: a cryptographic number can be trivially
duplicated (counterfeited/forged) and presented to a second or third
person. Thus, the receiver of such a piece of digital money must
confirm that it has not already been spent, that some bank will redeem
it for "real" money, etc.
Digital coupons have this same problem. (Real coupons are made fairly
counterfeit-resistant, as are such things as lottery tickets. Lottery
tickets also use a clever scheme whereby the winning number, the thing
that gets announced, is hashed/transformed into another number with a
secret key, and this second number is also printed on the ticket, but
would-be spoofers are unable to generate the second number.)
The complicated Chaum protocols, which now are going in the direction
of the tamper-resistant "observer" chips (in smartcards, PDAs, etc.),
address these issues of spoofing, denial, counterfeiting, etc., in
various ways.
Later, Hal makes another good point:
It seems likely to me that even now a group within the bowels of the
NSA and NIST is developing a "digital money clipper" (a euphonious
pun?), that is, a standard for digital money with similar sorts of
backdoors, emergency doors, etc., that Clipper has.
NSA/NIST surely knows of the pressures for digital money, and could
plan to introduce their own standard. Instead of "LEAFs" for the FBI
and other law enforcement, this one could have "IRS observers" and
"money-laundering observers" (this is wild speculation, I'll grant
you) which tie-in to currency exchange reporting, sales tax, and
income tax law enforcement systems.
It may be that Chaum, who is eager to actually get some sales to
groups within Europe and elsewhere, is already responding to some
pressures for "accountability" (the digital money version of
"wire-tappability") by various European governments and the observer
protocols are an effort to satisfy some of these concerns.
(I am not accusing Chaum of anything, just speculating that some
groups developing digital money--and Chaum is the clear leader
here--may have market or legal constraints which are shaping their
focus away from the digital money = untraceable cash = crypto anarchy
direction many of us favor.)
A "Cypherpunks digital money" system may be more urgent than ever.

There will therefore be no longer any privileged class, but there will be a government, and, note this well, an extremely complex government, which will not content itself with governing and administering the masses politically, as all governments do to-day, but which will also administer them economically, concentrating in its own hands the production and the just division of wealth, the cultivation of land, the establishment and development of factories, the organisation and direction of commerce,, finally the application of capital to production by the only banker, the State.

Such a regime will not fail to arouse very considerable discontent in this mass and in order to keep it in check the enlightenment and liberating government of Marx will have need of a not less considerable armed force.

THE REGIME OF TERROR
Suppose nevertheless that the partisans of an artificial organization, eith=
er the monopolists or the communists, are right; that society is not natura=
lly organized, and that the task of making and unmaking the laws that regul=
ate society continuously devolves upon men, look in what a lamentable situa=
tion the world would find itself. The moral authority of governors rests, i=
n reality, on the self-interest of the governed. The latter having a natura=
l tendency to resist anything harmful to their self-interest, unacknowledge=
d authority would continually require the help of physical force.
The monopolist and the communists, furthermore, completely understand this =
If anyone, says M. de Maistre, attempts to detract from the authority of Go=
d=E2=80=99s chosen ones, let him be turned over to the secular power, let t=
he hangman perform his office.
If anyone does not recognize the authority of those chosen by the people, s=
ay the theoreticians of the school of Rousseau, if he resists any decision =
whatsoever of the majority, let him be punished as an enemy of the sovereig=
n people, let the guillotine perform justice.
These two schools, which both take artificial organization as their point o=
f departure, necessarily lead to the same conclusion: TERROR.
In case the bottom line is not clear enough : fascists like james, who defe=
nd monopoly(monarchy) are the mirror image of the communists. Both are murd=
erous totalitarians.

The laudable motive of all these regulations is to extend our own manufactures, not by their own improvement, but by the depression of those of all our neighbours, and by putting an end, as much as possible, to the troublesome competition of such odious and disagreeable rivals. Our master manufacturers think it reasonable that they themselves should have the monopoly of the ingenuity of all their countrymen. Though by restraining, in some trades, the number of apprentices which can be employed at one time, and by imposing the necessity of a long apprenticeship in all trades, they endeavour, all of them, to confine the knowledge of their respective employments to as small a number as possible; they are unwilling, however, that any part of this small number should go abroad to instruct foreigners.

the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening
the sale of their goods, both at home and abroad. They say nothing
concerning the bad effects of high profits ; they are silent with regard to
the pernicious effects of their own gains; they complain only of those of
other people." masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always the masters. When the regulation,
therefore, is in favour of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes
otherwise when in favour of the masters. Thus the law which obliges the masters in several
different trades to pay their workmen in money, and not in goods, is quite just and equitable." together, in order to reduce the wages of their workmen, they commonly enter into a private
bond or agreement, not to give more than a certain wage, under a certain penalty. Were the
workmen to enter into a contrary combination of the same kind, not to accept of a certain
wage, under a certain penalty, the law would punish them very severely; and, if it dealt
impartially, it would treat the masters in the same manner. " -- but of course it doesn't.

We will content ourselves with making one simple observation on the subject of this new regime.
Just as the monopoly on security logically had to spawn universal monopoly, so communistic security must logically spawn universal communism.
In reality, we have a choice of two things:
Either communistic production is superior to free production, or it is not.
If it is, then it must be for all things, not just for security.
If not, progress requires that it be replaced by free production.
Complete communism or complete liberty: that is the alternative! " authorized by that law to seek his own happiness in his own way, to do what he will with himself and his property, so long as he does not trespass upon the equal liberty of others; authorized also, by that law, to defend his own rights, and redress his own wrongs; and to go to the assistance and defence of any  of his fellow men who may be suffering any kind of injustice --- how do millions of such men come to be a nation, in the first place? How is it that each of them comes to be stripped of his natural, God-given rights, and to be incorporated, compressed, compacted, and consolidated into a mass with other men, whom he never saw; with whom he has no contract; and towards many of whom he has no sentiments but fear, hatred, or contempt? How does he become subjected to the control of men like himself, who, by nature, had no authority over him; but who command him to do this, and forbid him to do that, as if they were his sovereigns, and he their subject; and as if their wills and their interests were the only standards of his duties and his rights; and who compel him to submission under peril of confiscation, imprisonment, and death?
Clearly all this is the work of force, or fraud, or both."

Confessions of an ex commie
By James A. Donald
When I was about 13, 14, 15, I felt very oppressed, and I read a lot of stu=
ff about participatory democracy. I became very keen on participatory democ=
racy. I realized that there would be a problem deciding who was to particip=
ate on what, but I figured that such trivial details could be taken care of=
 after the revolution, and I joined a radical leftist group at the age of 1=
5. They were Spartacists. Spartacists are a kind of Trotskyite, and Trotkyi=
tes are a kind of communist and there are innumerable obscure little trot f=
actions. The communists have a saying. =E2=80=9CTwo trots, three factions.=
This particular faction of the trots was very keen on participatory democra=
cy at that time, as were the left, and progressive forces generally at that=
 time.
I soon saw that the sparts' modus operandi was entryism. They would join mu=
ch larger organizations, organizations whose goals, motivations, and member=
s they despised, and then take over that organization and use its funds, as=
sets, and membership list for their own purposes, rather than for the origi=
nal purposes of the organization.
It rapidly became obvious to me that if a large organization was genuinely =
practicing participatory democracy it could easily be taken over by a small=
 well organized minority, and the only participatory organizations that cou=
ld resist the sparts were those that were already dominated by a small, wel=
l entrenched, minority. Usually a hostile, suspicious and somewhat paranoid=
 minority, a minority that tended to go on witch hunts for sparts from time=
 to time, and check under the bed for sparts before going to sleep at night.
I became disillusioned with the sparts, and disillusioned by participatory =
democracy =E2=80=93 and none too keen on representative democracy either. B=
ut I still believed that it could be made to work, that one could run socie=
ty and the economy and socialism in truly democratic fashion, but I realize=
d that it might not be quite as easy, or quite as democratic, as I had hope=
At the age of seventeen I joined both the anarcho socialists and the Maoist=
s =E2=80=93 mostly because these were the two groups most hated by the trot=
(Some years later I learnt that the main point of disagreement between Stal=
in and Trotsky was that Trotsky felt that Stalin was reluctant to murder en=
ough people, and reluctant to stamp out freedom with the sort of savage vig=
or that Trotsky delighted in. This did not surprise me in the slightest.)
Mostly I was active with the Maoists. The leaders of the Maoists were full =
of faith, zeal, and certainty. Each one's strength was as the strength of t=
en, because his heart was pure.
The anarcho socialist leader suffered from uncertainty, doubt, complexity, =
and participatory democracy. I will tell you more of the anarcho socialists=
 later, but first, the Maoists:
In my second year at university, the leadership group of the Maoists was ta=
ken by the Chinese government on a tour of China.
Now in those days =E2=80=9Cforeign friends=E2=80=9D who toured China usuall=
y reported that they had a really great time and that China was full collec=
tives full of happy, free and prosperous workers all equal, all working for=
 pure love of the common good, and all filled with holy zeal for the glorio=
us word of Chairman Mao.
Somehow my friends missed out on the Potemkin village tour and got the real=
ity tour instead. Or perhaps it is merely that the foreign friends who writ=
e those glowing reports are those who are best at closing their eyes.
When they returned they were changed men. When someone asked them about the=
ir trip they would be vague and quiet, and when they finally got around to =
answering they would change the subject and would not look you in the eye.
They would still tell you that China was a glorious workers paradise, but t=
hey no longer appeared to be listening to their own words, as if perhaps th=
ey could not bear to hear the words that they recited.
Most of them continued to work full time for the revolution, but they were =
no longer strong and full of faith, but weak, guilty, furtive, and a little=
 ashamed.
Gradually, most of the members of the Maoist group dropped out, as did I.
So now I engaged in most of my political activism with the chronically diso=
rganized anarcho socialists. The leader of the anarcho socialists genuinely=
 believed in participatory democracy, and as result nothing got done.
We would sometimes discuss how anarcho socialism would work, and I noticed =
that most of us had not the faintest idea, and those that did have an idea =
had ideas that sounded disturbingly like the ideas that my Maoist friends h=
ad before their trip to China.
My anarchist group had no literature on Catalonia. The leader, when discuss=
ing anarcho socialism, never mentioned Catalonia. Sometimes, when interacti=
ng with other anarcho socialist groups, I would see literature on the glori=
ous anarcho socialist society created in Catalonia for a short time. Our le=
ader tended to treat such literature as if was either invisible or coated w=
ith radioactive waste. Not that he ever said anything that suggested that C=
atalonia had ever fallen short of being the perfect anarchist utopia and si=
multaneously the perfect socialist utopia, but he appeared somewhat uncomfo=
rtable with the word =E2=80=9CCatalonia=E2=80=9D. Indeed he appeared incapa=
ble of speaking that word.
Reading the Catalonia literature, I noticed something that disturbed me a l=
ittle. The consolidation into larger economic units seemed curiously unifor=
m and swift. If it was voluntary, if people themselves decided where they w=
ould work and what work they would do, you would expect the small workshops=
 to gradually merge one by one, each merger separately negotiated.
An even more disturbing feature was the total silence from the gloriously l=
iberated workers of Catalonia, a silence strongly reminiscent of that which=
 I had noticed earlier from the gloriously liberated workers of Mao's China=
. The glowing reports of how well the Anarchist communes worked and how fre=
e they were all came from foreigners, who had been given something that dis=
turbingly resembled the official tours given to foreign friends in Mao's Ch=
ina, or they came from people who sounded suspiciously like rulers. How com=
e an anarchist society was capable of giving people something that curiousl=
y resembles an official tour? How come free people were so utterly silent?
So I stopped reading stuff about Catalonia. In one part of my mind I believ=
ed that Catalonia showed that freedom and socialism went together like ham =
and eggs. In another part of my mind I suspected that if I read too much ab=
out Catalonia I would suffer the same sad transformation as my Maoist frien=
ds had suffered.
But this mental conflict disturbed me, and I started thinking about propert=
y rights.
Imagine a society where you were given everything you needed free of charge=
, and gold was worthless or of little use. Imagine a society where you work=
ed for the common good without compensation for specific work.
Is this not the same thing as a society where someone else decides what you=
 need, and someone else decides what you do?
And is such a society not the same thing as a slave state?
Obviously, freedom is the choice to do what you want to do, not doing what =
the group thinks is good for the group. Selfishness may not be a virtue, bu=
t if selfishness is forbidden, then you are not free. And in order be free =
to do what you want to do you need space to do it in, and things to do it w=
ith. Property is simply those things that one is free to use or misuse as o=
ne pleases, wisely or unwisely, without asking permission. Thus freedom and=
 property rights are inseparable.
And not only does my property make me more free, but other people's propert=
y also makes me more free, provided it is not all owned by a single entity.=
 Freedom of the press is merely the property right of the guy who owns the =
press to print what he pleases, and my property right to buy what he prints=
, or not, as I please.
Any system where I am free to see or read what I please, and the publisher =
is free to publish what he pleases, is a system where someone like Stephen =
Spielberg will probably make a billion dollars. If I cannot choose who I pa=
y or not pay, then the publisher has no reason to publish what I am interes=
ted in, or he else is not free to publish what he wishes. Any system where =
someone like Stephen Spielberg is free to make a billion dollars will neces=
sarily be very similar to capitalism.
Imagine a society where all the printing presses and bulletin board systems=
 were owned by the government and run by a single bureaucracy charged with =
ensuring that all views were given =E2=80=9Cfair=E2=80=9D hearing, and all =
news was =E2=80=9Cfair=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cproperly balanced=E2=80=9D. Cl=
early this would be most unfree, and it is also likely that in practice cer=
tain views would not given any hearing, and that certain true facts would b=
e deemed to be inherently misleading and unbalanced.
And even if it was all perfectly fair and balanced, it would still deny me =
the opportunity to be unfair and unbalanced.
So I gradually came to realize that the failures of socialism were not acci=
dents, but rather an inherent consequence of socialism. Without private pro=
perty there is no room for any freedom whatsoever.
So I gradually dropped out from the anarcho socialists, but I continued to =
support the struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world against the evi=
ls of US imperialism.
It seemed to me then that there was a choice between liberty and equal econ=
omic outcomes, and that those that were poor and oppressed were right to pr=
efer equal economic outcomes to liberty and an empty belly.
It was obvious to me that when multinational corporations sought to spread =
capitalism around the world, it was not because they wished the workers hav=
e more choices on how to make a living.
I had come to realize that you could not have equal economic outcomes and l=
iberty both, but it is plain that you can have both slavery and gross inequ=
ality, and plain that in much of the world there was plenty of that.
Like all good progressive folk of that time (1976) I supported the heroic s=
truggle of the Cambodian people under the leadership of Pol Pot against the=
 evils of US imperialism.
But those Cambodian refugees just kept on coming, and their tales of horror=
 continued. Eventually I woke up.
I saw the truth.
There is no conflict between liberty and equality: If you hope to obtain eq=
uality by redistribution of wealth, you will need masters to allocate the g=
oodies, to avoid a free for all, and some will be masters, and the rest sub=
jects. The more redistribution, the more inequality you have in favor of th=
ose managing the redistribution, and against those looked after by their be=
tters. For example when the government intervenes to secure =E2=80=9CEmploy=
ee rights=E2=80=9D you wind up with an empowered human resources department=
, not empowered employees.
Inequality cannot be remedied by concentrated and centralized power, the gr=
eater such power, the greater the injustice. And power can only be disperse=
d if many particular people have complete authority over many particular se=
parate things, in other words, if everything is privately owned.
Liberty is property rights. Liberty is diminished in direct proportion as p=
roperty rights are violated.

Lance pointed out the chain cannot be built quickly.  This is not a problem
if servers connect to each other with relatively wide link-encrypted pipes

than DC-Nets.  The protocol would also provide both sender and receiver

   P.S. I never gave a name for the protocol... let's call it Pipe-net.
I don't think we really need a separate name for it just yet.  The
idea is composed of two pretty much independent elements: packet
forwarding and virtual link encryption.  These can be implemented
separately and then combined to yield the kind of network interaction
Getting the details right will be difficult, and I'd suggest that is
where the discussion might profitably turn next.

   One of the lessons learned in the years-long debate between the
   telco folks pushing synchronous time-division multiplexing point to
   point circuit switches and the data folks pushing variable length
   packet-switched broadcast medium networks is that fixed length
   packets can give you both TDM and statistical multiplexing.
There's an important difference here.  Namely, the telco/ATM folks
were building hardware from scratch and we're not.  We're layering on
top of an existing Internet routing environment.
This doesn't mean that your point is wrong, but that it may no longer
be true when the base layer is IP.  I'm not familiar enough with the
ATM arguments to know whether they're still valid in this other
=46rom cypherpunks  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003
You could just send a stream of some uncomon ascii character, which you
filter out on the receiving end (if you wanted to this right, you could add
a simple escape mechanism for actually passing that character).
To avoid flooding the network and also bringing the machines on which its
running to its knees, you'd probably want to add a bandwidth-choke
mechanism to run the white noise at some reasonable rate.  You'd have to li=
the real traffic output to the same rate.  Link encryption over a broadcast
network is a tricky business.
For the next couple of months, I have absolutely no free hacking time.
Things on the stack include:
So I don't even have the time to figure out whether I have the interest.
=46rom cypherpunks  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003
Ay, what a good point.  I know this connection is incredibly obvious, but
just in case no one has yet made it, I will.  A "pipe-net" host running
Wei's L- modification to Matt's ESM, which was also running a remailer,
would provide pretty much untraceable entrance to the remailer net.  The
remailer software wouldn't even need to be integrated with the pipe
software in any way, as long as the user had a secure connection to the
host, he could just connect to the SMTP port and send the message to the
remailer that way.
I would guess that the attack Wei described, as well as almost every other,
if not every other, traffic analysis attack would fail if users were
utilizing this.  You could trace the message to a given "pipe net" host
using traffic analysis, but you wouldn't be able to trace it to a user, if
he was using the pipe net appropriately.  Obviously, this also requires a
sufficient number of people to be using the pipe net host, so that no real
information is gained just by tracing the connection to a given pipenet
host.  And of course non-pipe-net users are using the remailer on the
machine to, which makes things a tiny bit more complicated for the traffic
Note also that the bandwith could be kept extremely low.  Even something
like 10cps.  So, maybe it takes you up to a couple hours to actually
transit your message to the pipe-net host remailer,  but we currently dont'
expect instantaneous remailernet transmission anyway.  We've learned to
live with latency on the order of hours, as opposed to seconds, so adding
several more hours onto the chain isn't a problem.  And with a bandwith
maintained that low, the pipenet host could theoretically host many many
"pipe net remailer" client users, without causing a serious problem.
This seems like a really exciting thing to me.  That we already have the
tools available for, right now at this very second, now that Wei has done
the link encryption mod to ESM.

@_subject: Re: F2F UDP mesh net prototype proof of concept 
This attack reveals what seems to be a fallacy in theoretical definitions of security.
For example, in [28], the authors state that if links are padded or bandwidth is limited
to a constant rate, one can ignore passive eavesdroppers8. This is technically correct if
a passive eavesdropper is defined as someone who cannot access the network as a reg-
ular user and compute timings on the network (which is implied by the definition used
in most theoretical work). However this attack model is not very interesting and defi-
nitely misleading. The latency attack pointed out above and the next attack we present
demonstrate that if an attacker can simply compute timings (which is as passive as one
can expect an attacker to be in practice), or use the system, link padding or bandwidth
limiting links to a constant rate does not protect the system against easy traffic analysis

"Suppose the adversary runs just two routers. If we take into account the way Tor chooses circuits, the size of the network ], and the number of users observed on Tor in one day , we expect the adversary to compromise 15 users at least once in that day. If the adversary provides the top two routers by bandwidth, the expected number of compromised users increases to 9464.1 Thus, the system provides poor anonymity against a wide variety of realistic opponents, such as governments, ISPs,"
that comes directly from supreme scum-master syverson himself. What's really astounding is that at the same time syverson and the rest of tor shitbags advertise tor as a means for people to "protect themselves against traffic analysis".

My hard disk now contains an archive of all the messages (I hope...there
are 90k of them) posted on cypherpunks, since the beginning.  It's
CD-ROM sized; I'm building a glimpse index of them right now and will put
them up on the web (tentatively somewhere on  soon.  I'll also be happy to copy them onto particular media (tape, cd, etc.) if I have access to the drive, for cost + a meager amount to make it worth the
effort.  I think getting list archives distributed to as many people as
possible would be a good thing -- hopefully a recursive auction market will
start and people will leave me alone after a while.
I'm doing this because there isn't a decent searchable index anywhere
that I've found, and it would be a nice thing to have, and I don't think
the time is too far off when people will try to eliminate the list.  I've
been using the archive of cpunks as my test data set in writing Eternity
DDS -- I thought it was vaguely poetic, in a way.
Doh -- I thought my dataset included everything, but it instead just
covers every article I can think of between:
and the present.  I'm also feeling tempted to incorporate the archives of
some of the offshoot mailing lists, like coderpunks, etc.  Does anyone know of a good source for the messages before that one?  How
many were there, approximately?  If there are a bunch of them and you can
merge them with mine, I'll be happy to send you a cd of the result.
If enough people want to buy CDs of the data, I'll set up an order page,
establish pricing, etc.  Right now, for me to make a CD requires buying
media and doing it at the media lab, unless I buy a drive, so the cost
is somewhat dependent upon how many people are interested.  If someone wants
to use corporate or government money to overpay for a cd so I can buy
a cd-r writer and make it cheaper for everyone else, I'll think fondly of
whatever organization you represent :)  Utterly ignoring the copyright issues in the interest of getting wide

@_subject: censorship, sorry, I mean, 'moderation' 
Dimitri's discussion of the moderation experiment prompted me to dig
up this history of the event I wrote shortly after the distributed
lists were setup.  I did promise around this time to repost this later
after the moderation experiment to ensure that it wouldn't be itself
If Attila and Dimitri's suspicions are correct, in addition to the
below, cypherpunks-unedited may actually have been hand edited, and
have had filters placed on it which rejected certain postsers articles
out of hand, or auto-forwarding them to cypherpunks-flames.  Other
list members may be able to verify some the uncertainty surrounding
these aspects of the censorship experiment.
There appears to be a bit of a hush up surrounding the circumstances
of the pause in the moderation experiment and subsequent change of
moderation policy.
To clear the air, I think it would be kind of nice if the full story
were told, so I'll gather here a history as I understand it.
Information from my archives (those I have), and from asking around in
I realise that some of the actions that I am claiming of participants
in this sequence of events seem hard to believe given their high
reputation capital.  I was myself initially dubious on the strength of
the reputation capital of those being critisized.
However the below is the sequence of events as close as I can
I welcome being proven wrong on any points.
1. Dimitri Vulis posted a lot of off topic posts over a period of time
2. Dimitri reposted a couple of 50k Serdar Argic revisionist articles 3. Dimitri challenged John Gilmore to shut him up
4. John unsubscribed Dimitri, and modified majordomo to
siltently ignore Dimitri's attempts to resubscribe.  Dimitri could
still post, and presumably read cypherpunks with a different email
address or via an archive.  It was a token unsubscription only.
5. When Dimitri figured out what John had done, he made many posts
denigrating John as a censor
6. Much discussion ensued critisizing John for blocking Dimitri
7. Over Christmas some joker subscribed cypherpunks to a load
of sports mailing lists, Hugh Daniels and John cleaned up the mess
8. Followed a long thread on hardening lists against spam attacks
9. John made a post to the list announcing that the list would be
moderated for one month from Jan 11 as an experiment, and included
Sandy Sandfort's proposed moderatation policy and offer to act as
moderator.  It appeared that the moderation experiment was Sandy's
suggestion, and that John had agreed to go along with it.
10. Some discussion both pro and con of moderation, and the technical
, free speech, and legal aspects followed
11. Moderation started Jan 19, the main list became the moderated list
12. Lots of people complained about the moderation, some defended it
Tim May quietly unsubscribed
13. Some people complained about inconsistency in moderation -- some
articles which went to flames were not flamish, but made by posters
with low reputation capital, or were following up to posts which were
14. After a while some people commented on Tim's absence, and sent him
mail asking what happened.  Tim posted an article explaining that he
had left because of the imposed moderation without discussion.
15. John followed up with a post defending the moderation experiment,
and arguing for it's popularity (he claimed as evidence the number of
posters who had not taken the trouble to move to the unedited list).
16. Dimitri posted an article where he claimed that there was a
security flaw in Stronghold.  Stronghold is C2Nets commercial version
of the freeware Apache SSL web server.  Sandy is employed by C2Net.
17. Sandy dropped the posting entirely -- it went to neither
cypherpunks (edited), nor cypherpunks-flames.  He considered that
forwarding the posting would have made him legally liable.  Sandy is a
lawyer by profession.  He did not explain this situation on the list.
18. Tim May had by now subscribed to cypherpunks-flames, and posted
several follow-ups to Dimitri's posting, discussing the issue of
Dimitri's post being dropped, and stated that Dimitri's posting was
not flamish, and should not have been dropped in his opinion.  Tim's
postings were also silently dropped, going to neither of cypherpunks
(edited), and cypherpunks-flames.
19. Sandy made an announcement that he was ending his participation in
the moderation experiment.  Still no explanation of why posts were
dropped, or even admission that they were.
20. The two moderated cypherpunks lists (cypherpunks and
cypherpunks-flames) went dead for some time.
21. Tim received a warning from C2Net's lawyers that if he did not
desist from mentioning that Dimitri had posted an article criticising
a C2Net product that he would be sued!
22. John posted a statement where he explained Sandy's sudden
announcement of ending his particpation.  John explained that Sandy
had "hit a pothole in the moderation experiment when Mr. Nemesis
submitted a posting containing nothing but libelous statements about
Sandy's employer".  Sandy did not drop Johns posting even though it
covered the same topics that had resulted in Tim's posts being
dropped, and resulted in Tim receiving legal threats from C2Net.  In
the same post John said that he had come to the conclusion that he was
no longer willing to host the cypherpunks list.  In this post John
announced that Sandy had been persuaded to continue to moderate for
the remainder of the moderation period, and gave the new policy.  The
changes were that anything other than crypto discussion and discussion
of forming a new cypherpunks list would go to flames, and anything
that Sandy thought was libelous would be dropped silently.
23. Sandy posted a statement affirming that he would continue to
moderate, and that if any cypherpunks wished to discuss his prior
moderation policy and performance as a moderator that they do it on
new lists which they create themselves.
(If Sandy's current moderation criteria mean that he feels obliged to
forward this post to cypherpunks-flames as off-topic, or even to
silently drop it from both moderated lists, so be it.  I will simply
repost it later, when the moderation experiment is over on one of the
new lists.  In the event of myself receiving legal threats, I shall
simply post it via a remailer, or rely on someone else to do so.  C2

The positive outcome of all this has been to make the cypherpunks list
more resilient to legal attack.  The new distributed list seems to be
progressing well, and will be less liable to attack.  Filtering
services continue, as they should.  And alt.cypherpunks has been
created as a forum ultimately resistant to legal attack.
Also I should say that I would hope that no one holds any long term
animosity towards any of the players in this episode, many of the
people have been very prolific in their work to further online privacy
and freedom, and I hope that we can all put this chapter behind us.
Now more fun things...
Anyone checked out the DES breaking project?
Over on          are details of mailing lists where people are organising breaking
RSADSIs DES challenge.  For the RC5/32/12/6 (48 bit RC5) break which
took 13 days, it seems there were a peak of 5000 machines involved.
At this rate it will take 8 months to break DES.

then we have "Influenza spreads around the world in yearly outbreaks, resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths"
and lastly the current flu hysteria count : notice the widely differing mortality rates.
