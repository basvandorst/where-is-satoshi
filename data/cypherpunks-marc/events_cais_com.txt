A LOOK BACK:
On April 26, 2001 - at the Reagan Trade Center in Washington, D.C. - Market*Access produced an important conference on Homeland Defense. The purpose of the conference was to highlight the need for a Homeland Defense program and the special needs of "first responders". Speakers included Congressman Curt Weldon of Philadelphia and leading executives from the DoD and U.S. civilian agencies. Representative Weldon brought a hush over the audience when he reminded us that it is not "if", but "when".
.... and now we are faced with a new national priority.
*  On October 23, 2001, Market*Access held a Homeland Defense Business Briefing in Washington, D.C.  Speakers included Governor Tom Ridge, newly appointed White House Director, Homeland Security.
*  On October 29, 2001, Market*Access held a Homeland Defense Conference taking a look at agency programs and initiatives.

ABOUT THIS CONFERENCE:
The prevalence of cell phones and other wireless communications in our society had a dramatic influence on the events of 11 September 2001.  The ability of passengers to communicate with the outside world evidently played a major role in helping them formulate a plan of action. Cell phones allowed some of those trapped in the upper floors of the World Trade Center to communicate with loved ones in their final moments, and the phones may have let rescuers know that trapped victims were still alive.
The utility of cell phones and other wireless devices in shaping our response to a terrorist event has never been examined - until now. For terrorist events in general, modern and robust communications systems will play a key role in successful consequence management. Networks are the precondition, but they are not sufficient in themselves to provide a significant advantage. Communications applications designed in advance that will travel over the networks to provide for early detection and effective consequence management will make the key difference.
Market*Access will host in important training conference for industry and government focusing on agency needs and requirements in the area of Homeland Defense: Mobile and Wireless Communications.  This will be a public-level series of training presentations on the challenges ahead. We can learn how devices like cell phones, handheld computers, interactive pagers, Palm Pilots, and other PDAs can assist as important tools in the area of Homeland Defense and consequence management.  Speakers will represent federal agencies and leading security, equipment and systems suppliers.
ABOUT HOMELAND DEFENSE:
The United States and its allies face a number of new and difficult security challenges in the coming millennium. While past threats came from other states and were primarily aimed at U.S. forces or allies overseas, new challenges --- such as the proliferation of missiles and weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and attacks on our information infrastructure --- may well involve non-state actors and has directly affected security at home. We will have to rethink basic policies, federal and state organization for national security, and the allocation of resources to meet both old and new defense tasks.
The goal of this meeting is to begin to prepare U.S. government and industry for the changes that will come about regarding wireless and mobile communications.
