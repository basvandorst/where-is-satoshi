       Thank you for contacting me via e-mail. I appreciate hearing from you
and knowing of your views on issues that affect our nation. Be assured, I am
listening carefully to the views of the people of Florida's 23rd District
and will make my decisions in the House of Representatives accordingly.
       Unfortunately, due to the large volume of e-mail that my office
receives, it is impossible to answer each one personally. If you do reside
in the 23rd District of Florida and would like a direct response to your
concerns, please write to me by regular mail at 2235 Rayburn House Office
Building, Washington, DC, 20515.
       Again, thank you so much for contacting me. With kind regards, I
                                                       Alcee L. Hastings
