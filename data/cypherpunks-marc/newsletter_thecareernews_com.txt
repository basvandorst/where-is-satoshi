And while there are currently millions of jobs listed on amongst all the top career websites More and more, many companies report they are searching the job boards for candidates without posting their upcoming jobs -- due to fear of an onslaught of
unqualified applications.That makes this is the BEST time to put your resume on all major career sites which are collectively reported to be searched by 1.5 million employers and recruiters and hiring managers daily.According to a poll by the Society for Human Resource Management, 88% of human resource professionals now rely on Internet to fill open positions open in their organizations.

Especially now.While many companies search the largest career sites, increasingly employers and recruiters are cutting costs by searching the lesser expensive mid-sized career sites.This means that the hiring managers and jobs are dispersed amongst a large number of career sites. And in this market,
the window of opportunity for a job is a little smaller than usual, so it's important that you're where the jobs are when they're available.Can I Post My Resume Confidentially?You can still post your resume online while remaining anonymous if you use Resume Rabbit by selecting "Post My Resume Confidentially" during their registration process.

It's a fact
that most hiring managers use the internet to find their candidates. Of course, when there are more jobs available in the market, your chances are better of finding a job faster.However, even when the job market is weak, then it's even more important that you give yourself a competitive advantage over others competing for the same jobs, by making sure your resume is "findable" on ALL top career sites. Here are a couple of comments about being on all the career sites from users of Resume Rabbit:A customer service representative in Missouri named Jim used Resume Rabbit to post his resume and commented,"I signed up on a Tuesday and by Thursday the job offers started pouring in. By Friday, I had a job set
up!"Ronnie, a sales representative in Texas reports, "I got the account on Sunday evening and by Monday morning I was already getting phone calls from recruiters. That was fast and easy. There are so many job sites out there it would have taken weeks."Since 1999 Resume Rabbit has performed over 1 million resume postings for some very happy customers who feel the service can't be beat.

Companies expected to make post-holiday hiring push
Abridged: MSN.com
DOVER, DE -- Employment trends are looking up for job seekers in 2005. The Labor Department this month reported 157,000 new jobs in December; that figure underwhelmed economists but sets the stage for a big New Year's push by companies that delayed hiring until after the holidays. About 45% of employers say they will add staff in the next three months and that makes it the brightest job market in four years. If you haven't looked for work in a while, things have changed. Here's how to find a job now.Get ruthless with your resume. Get rid of the fluff. Use keywords that employers might be searching for on databases: programs you know, languages you speak, and so on.Prepare to talk, talk, talk. Companies now expect you to pass muster with the multitudes: it's called "consensus hiring." This will almost certainly lead to multiple interviews. Make sure you hit your theme in every one of them.

Put those goals in writing
Suzanne Mulvehill, MBA, Excerpt from Employee to Entrepreneur LAKE WORTH, FL -- "I put my goals in writing today. It felt good. It felt courageous. Now, I'll start accomplishing them, one at a time." So many times, I asked clients if they had goals and they responded, "Yes, I have goals, but they are all in my head." That means they never wrote them down. Their first assignment was to put those goals in writing. When you put your goals in writing, you have the benefit of making a commitment to yourself. When you make a commitment to yourself, you have the opportunity to work toward accomplishing a goal, which builds courage and confidence. Second, you can feel confident in knowing you have a plan of action. You know what you want to
accomplish and you have it in writing. When we set goals, we need to consider both our personal and professional goals. By setting personal goals in addition to professional goals, we grow in the direction we desire. Consider the following questions as you begin to set your goals: 1) Is the goal measurable? 2) Is the goal time sensitive? 3) Is the goal realistic?
Jobless claims rise unexpectedly in latest week
Abridged: USAToday.com
WASHINGTON, DC -- The number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits grew unexpectedly last week to 367,000, the government said Thursday, but the number of those continuing to file claims fell sharply, to their lowest level since mid-2001. A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast first-time claims for state unemployment benefit would fall to 340,000 the week ended Jan. 8 from 357,000 the previous week.The Labor Department said the latest week's claims were the highest since late September last year and there were no special factors to account for the increase. As well as a gain in initial claims, the four-week moving average of filings, which smoothes weekly
fluctuations to provide a better picture of underlying trends, advanced to 344,000 from a revised 331,250. Economists had forecast a four-week average of 338,000.The number of unemployed on the benefit rolls after claiming an initial week of aid declined 219,000 to 2.631 million the week ended Jan. 1, the latest for which figures are available. The Labor Department said that was the lowest reading for insured unemployment since April 7, 2001, when 2.577 million people were on the rolls.

Success stories: A view from the top
George Blomgren, Tips From An Employer
MILWAUKEE, WI -- I was recently asked how I, as an employer, feel when candidates share success stories -- especially in the format of formalized case studies. Great question! Simply put: it's a huge positive. It says a lot about a candidate. First, it demonstrates a great deal of preparation and that the candidate takes his or her job search seriously. Second, listening to a story is always much more interesting than listening to a speech.Bu the main plus is that it creates credibility. A candidate who responds to the question "How are your project management skills?" by saying "Great." is not as credible as one who tells a story about a challenging project she successfully led
to completion. The latter is more believable, more memorable, more convincing.I don't especially like trying to figure out how a laundry list of skills and accomplishments (for example, on a resume) corresponds to the real-world challenges associated with the positions we have open. A candidate who does the work for me -- by sharing relevant stories (case studies) -- will always have a distinct advantage.
Education can be the key to your success
Staff Writer, The Career News
NEW YORK, NY -- According to the U.S. Census Bureau the difference in lifetime earnings between a high school diploma and bachelor's degree is a million dollars. Add on a master's degree and you can expect to get an additional half a million dollars in earnings. Those with professional degrees earn much more - about 4.4 million dollars during their working life.Jennifer Day, Chief of the Education and Social Stratification Branch at the U.S. Census Bureau says "In 1999, average annual earnings ranged from $19,000 for high school dropouts, to $26,000 for high school graduates, and $45,000 for college graduates and $99,000 for the holders of professional degrees. That includes
medical doctors, dentists, veterinarians and lawyers.With advances in technology, you can now get your degree online, from a credible university in your spare time and from the comfort of your own home.

Wrangling multiple interviews without getting whipped
Wendy Terwelp, Career Coach
MILWAUKEE, WI -- "I talked with eight different people at two companies," said one executive client. "Is this common now? I was whipped by the time I got to the last couple." Seems the higher up you go, the more decision makers are involved. It's not just an HR decision at that point. Here are quick tips to handle the herd of interviewers, without getting thrown off your feet. 1) Research the company. Know the product or service inside and out -- and how your skills will be of value. 2) Contact a company insider to get a feel for the people you may be meeting. 3) If you get names, Google them to find out more information. 4) Get a good night's sleep before the interview, so you
don't fall asleep during the interview. 5) Eat breakfast, in case you are interviewing nonstop. You don't want to faint from hunger. 6) Bring at least 10 resumes so you can hand out good prints to your interviewers. Retain one for yourself -- in case they grill you on each point. 7) Take notes. Get names and titles. 8) Send each different interviewer a thank-you note.

Unadvertised Jobs: Get The Inside Track
Staff Writer, The Career News
If you're currently in the job market, here's the little known secret to tapping into the most lucrative, yet hidden jobs available. Even in this economy, there are still millions of great jobs out there. It's just that many of the best ones never make their way to the classifieds. Instead, they're taken by people who know about them before they're ever advertised. Imagine how great it would be if you had thousands of friends who'd always tell you about unadvertised jobs that you're perfect for.As they say, it's not what you know it's who you know. The secret to getting the unadvertised jobs is to make friends out of really good recruiters. And not just a few, but LOTS of
them. Here's why, and how you do it:Recruiters, otherwise known as headhunters or search consultants, are hired by companies to find candidates to fill open positions. These jobs are often never advertised. But the secret of how to best use recruiters is to first realize that contrary to popular belief they don't work for you. This is an important fact that most job seekers don't understand. The key to maximizing recruiters is to understand the following: Recruiters don't find jobs for people -- they find people for jobs. It's an important distinction to understand if you want to get a job through a recruiter.In other words, recruiters service the people who will pay them today. And unless you're paying a recruiter out of
your pocket today, don't expect them to canvas the world to find you a job. You'll only be disappointed. Recruiters will be interested in you if you meet the criteria of a job one of their client companies has asked them to fill, or they believe they'll soon be asked to fill.So to get the hidden jobs, you have to realize it's a numbers game and you must play it well by getting your resume to as many recruiters as you can, that specialize in people with your skills, in your field and in your geographic area. You can search the internet and find various lists of executive recruiters. However, they're not well organized, complete or easy to find. It might take you a great deal of time. Alternatively if you want to instantly
get your resume in the hands of 1000's of specialized recruiters, try a service like Resume Mailman by following
this link.Resume Mailman will instantly put your resume directly into the hands of 1000's of America's very best recruiters. The ResumeMailman network is filled with pre-screened and talented recruiters that have connections to tons of unadvertised jobs. Your resume is instantly emailed to 1000's of recruiters in your selected areas, specializing in your selected skill sets.With Resume Mailman the process of getting your resume out to these recruiters takes about 10 minutes!

contact list of all the recruiters who received your resume. Following up with these recruiters will only help move you to the top of their minds and your resume to the top of the stack. This is a very effective yet little known way to quickly gain access to the unadvertised jobs. To check out Resume Mailman, go to this link.While some recruiters may not have something for you today, if their clients regularly look for people with your skills, they will add you to their database. That's a good thing. The first place a recruiter looks when a client comes to them with a job to fill, is their own personal candidate database. It's never too late or too early to start
networking with recruiters in your area who specialize in people like you. Give yourself the competitive edge and get the inside track on unadvertised jobs. Just get your resume to as many recruiters as possible that specialize in your skills, industry and location. They say there's strength in numbers.

Get your best job ever in 2005
Abridged: CNN.com
ATLANTA, GA -- Finding the best job ever may mean one thing to you and something totally different to someone else. When most people think about getting a great job, they immediately think of money. But while money is important, a survey conducted by CareerBuilder.com found one-in-five workers were dissatisfied with their jobs overall, partly due to factors that had little to do with compensation.What do people dislike about their careers? 45 percent reported their workloads were too heavy and 40 percent said their current organizations were lacking in career advancement opportunities. In addition, 39 percent of workers said they were disappointed with the performance of their
corporate leaders and 32 percent said they were dissatisfied with their work/life balance.If this survey is any indication, you need to consider what your career and life values are and use them to steer your job search. How would you describe a fulfilling and challenging career? The bottom line is that knowing what your priorities and preferences are at the beginning of your job search will help you on your way to finding your best job ever in 2005.

Quick tips for better resume response
Wendy Terwelp, Career Coach
MILWAUKEE, WI -- "Can we talk about the obvious?" said recruiter Khris Klimowicz. "When we do a keyword search, sometimes we just look at job titles. Tweak your job title to reflect your actual duties and what is common to the rest of the world." When asked for an example, she said, "Paraprofessional." I said, "That's like a teacher's aid." She said, "Why not say so? Everyone knows what a teacher's aid is."Other tips she recommends: 1) Use a professional email address. No goofy names. No birth dates in the address. First initial, last name is the recommendation. 2) Review your employment dates to see if they are logical. Did you really start work in 1896 or was that a typo? 3)
Use normal, common sense language, not corporate jargon or odd titles. "Clerk, Level 2" has no specific identity in the real world.
Labor report: Hiring in '04 highest in years
Abridged: The Seattle Times
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Employers hired workers in 2004 at the fastest pace in five years, with overall payrolls rising by 2.2 million. December's job growth was a bit lower than expected, with the unemployment rate holding at 5.4 percent. The Labor Department reported yesterday that employers expanded their payrolls by a net 157,000 in December, bringing the year's increase to the highest level since 1999. That year, 3.2 million jobs were created, based on a government survey of businesses. For the year 2004, the average unemployment rate was 5.5 percent. That was the lowest since 2001, when the average annual rate was 4.7 percent. The report didn't wow economists, but it didn't
sour them either. "2004 didn't go out like a lion, but it didn't go out like a lamb," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "It went out like a cow: beefy but docile."The service sector continued to spark overall hiring last month, without help from retailers. The job growth was concentrated in the health-care industry, which added a net 36,000 positions, and business and professional services, which hired a net 41,000 workers.

Missed interview? How to kiss and make up.
George Blomgren , Tips From An Employer MILWAUKEE, WI -- Near the top of the list of common frustrations for interviewers is how often candidates miss interviews -- and how poorly they handle it when they do. Common courtesy alone warrants at least a phone call or email in advance, letting an interviewer know you won't be able to make a scheduled interview. Common courtesy and common sense: why burn bridges? If you miss an interview and you can't provide advance notice, an apology is certainly appropriate.If you need to reschedule an interview, suggest a few times that would work for you, but be prepared to be flexible. And recognize that it may not happen: there may be a firm deadline for a hiring decision. If you
have to reschedule more than once, realize that your chances of getting in front of the interviewer decrease significantly each time you reschedule.Having said that, don't underestimate how reasonable most interviewers will be if you make an effort to work with them. A sincere apology, a legitimate reason (white lies tend to be obvious) and a clear desire to reschedule will generally get you another chance.
Stuck in a job search rut?
Staff Writer, The Career News
LOS ANGELES, CA -- Are you are stuck in a rut and not getting phone calls for interviews? If so, it can make sense to use a recruiter to broaden your job search. Recruiters are especially helpful if you are in a high level position or if you are in an industry that traditionally uses search firms to fill vacancies since those jobs are not typically advertised. Search firms have contacts in industries and at companies that you might not even be aware of. They can help market your resume and provide you with additional exposure to potential employers that may not be advertising openings. If you don't know of any good recruiters, consider using a service that will email your resume
to 100's of pre-screened recruiters, who are currently requesting resumes of people with your skills, in your geographic location. One of the more quality services like this we've found is called Resume Mailman and can be found at Resume Mailman.
Is 'earning a living' stopping you?
Stacey Mayo, MCC
ATLANTA, GA -- Every year, people resolve that "this" New Year will be different: "This will be the year that I start that new venture, double my income." However, when people think about pursuing their dreams, they often squash the idea because it doesn't seem practical. People are afraid that if they pursue their greatest dreams, they would risk giving up what they have such as their lifestyle or security. It is easy to put it off to a later date when there will be more money or more time.However, there is never a time when everything in your life is perfect for carrying out your goals. After supporting thousands of people in making their personal and professional dreams a
reality, I have found the following strategies to be most effective:Design your life around your priorities. Visualize every step of your dream and watch the magic unfold. Laser in on one idea at a time. Handle the basics (food, clothing & shelter). Reach for fulfillment and self-actualization. Develop your resilience muscle by bouncing back from setbacks.

Companies recruiting discharged troops
Abridged: HoustonChronicle.com
DES MOINES, IOWA - Former soldiers, including those returning from Iraq or Afghanistan with disabilities, are finding that their military background can help them get jobs in civilian companies. Maytag Corp., for example, has an aggressive recruiting program. Home Depot began Operation Career Front and Toyota North America started its Hire A Hero program in the past few years.Companies say it's a win for them because they get high-quality workers. "They have great discipline. They have great technical skills. They understand how to follow orders and follow procedures," said Art Learmonth, president of Maytag Services. About 5,000 companies are registered with the
Marine For Life program, which helps soldiers find work in civilian businesses after leaving the service, said Maj. Carolyn Dysart, spokeswoman for the program. "There's been a real wave of support for the military. It's wonderful since the war on terrorism began. These are all outgrowths of that," she said. Almost 40 companies have signed on to a separate program that hires disabled veterans. The list includes Colonial Life Insurance, and the corporate office of Time Warner Cable, a unit of Time Warner Inc.
Try a different approach to your job search Staff Writer, The Career News
VIRGINIA BEACH, VA -- Have you spent hours upon hours in your job search only to find that you get few responses back no matter how many resumes you email? These days emails are being deleted at a significant rate without ever being opened. That's because many hiring managers are simply overwhelmed with the amount of emailed resumes they have to go through. Consider a different approach. Try faxing your resume directly to employers you're interested in. Unlike email, when you fax your resume the recipient can't delete it without opening it. Moreover, if your faxed resume is addressed to the actual decision maker, it almost always ends up on that person's desk and gets reviewed.
If this sounds like a good idea to you, we recommend using JobsByFax. This company has categorized 3.9 Million employers into about 73 categories. They'll quickly fax your resume directly to the exact type of employers you want in your selected geographic areas. To find out how many employers they have that match your criteria just Follow this link.

For the second year in a row, surveyed employers predicted an increase in college-graduate hiring. Employers predicted they would hire 13.1 percent more graduates from the college class of 2005 than the class of 2004, the study said. "This year it does seem more positive," says Andrea Koncz, employment information manager at the National Association of Colleges and Employers. "Things are starting to pick up." With more jobs out there, employers are finding they will have to compete
for the best candidates. In the current survey, employers predicted their biggest challenge for recruiting this academic year would be competition, followed by finding the right candidates and attracting students to a specific industry or location.The list of employers' 10 most-sought-after majors changed little from past surveys, continuing to favor students with specific business skills. The five most "in demand" majors were accounting; electrical engineering; mechanical engineering; business administration and management; and economics and finance.
Tips: Transitioning from employee to self-employed
Suzanne Mulvehill, MBA
LAKE WORTH, FL -- I knew I wasn't fulfilled in the workforce, but was scared to death of being on my own. I liked the security of a job. When I finally left my job after three prior attempts to quit, I was a business counselor for a Small Business Development Center and discovered many people struggled with transitioning out of the workforce. Below are a few things that helped us break out of the employee mentality:Do one simple thing different every day. I never used to valet park, so I tried it. I always walked my dog down a certain street and started walking down different streets. Little changes prepare us for bigger changes. Exercise your risk muscle. "Take a risk,
any risk!" said Dale Carnegie, author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People." Start taking small risks and feel the discomfort and/or excitement of the risk. For example, go on a trip you've wanted to go on -- and had been putting off. Treat yourself to something nice. Say, "No" to something you've wanted to say no to. If I can do it, you can too!
Learn how you can own your own business
Staff Writer, The Career News
LAS VEGAS, NV -- Have you dreamed of owning your own business but don't know where to start? Franchises are becoming more and more popular as a way for people to buy and own their own business. Here are 4 main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you're able to operate your own business with the security of working with a large company. Second, the start-up, operations and general business plans are laid out for you with training and support from the franchisor. Third, you reduce your risk due to the success of the franchisor's reputation & experience. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to start a franchise than an independent business. If you've been thinking about
starting your own business, we recommend a free consultation with FranChoice, the premier "matchmaker" of the franchising industry.During your consultation, the consultants from FranChoice will help you identify franchise businesses that meet your criteria based on your goals, skills and preferences.

Shaq attack: Avoid sports lingo in cover letters
George Blomgren, Tips From An Employer MILWAUKEE, WI -- A friend in human resources (HR) currently has an opening for an IT position. A cover letter and resume he recently received is a case study in several mistakes you want to avoid.First, the candidate responded to screening questions using chat style grammar. Unfortunately, "u r not impressing anyone when u write this way." Second, he didn't consider that in most companies, HR people review cover letters. HR people don't know what "ghosting xp w/sp2 slipstreamed" means. In any field, translate technical achievements, skills, and experience into plain English. Your cover letter isn't the place to show off your technical vocabulary.
Wait until you are interviewing with people who share your technical knowledge. Finally, this candidate is apparently a big sports fan. To quote, "I am the Shaq of help desk." Not everyone gets sports metaphors. Unless you're applying for a sports-related position, avoid them.There's a common thread here. The position is for help desk. Help desk requires communication and empathy as much as technology expertise. These three mistakes demonstrated limited skills in these areas, even if the candidate is the "Shaq of help desk."

The comparison trap
Pat Schuler, Business Development Coach
MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- When we compare ourselves to others, we usually compare to the person with a bigger house, nicer car, faster boat, or better job. This is a great source of pain and suffering to many of us. Why don't we have a company car? Didn't we work hard this past year? Why did Ted get twice the bonus we did? Or twice the severance?I heard the great motivational speaker, Jim Rohn, warn against being an "at-leaster" in a live presentation. This starts by comparing yourself to someone else and saying, "At least I don't...(do a particular thing) as badly as he does." Mr. Rohn saw these people as mediocrities not committed enough to either fail or excel spectacularly.
Have you fallen into the trap of being an "at-leaster"? Are you comparing and finding comfort in not being as bad as the next person? Do you have the courage to make a commitment and either fail or succeed spectacularly? Or are you content to sit in the safe middle ground? Or do you want to be the person others are using as their benchmark for success?

Recruiters share secret job search tips
Abridged: The Seattle Times
DOUBLE OAK, TX -- About once a month, Gail Houston and Rex Saoit leave their desk jobs to stand before a classroom of adults who want to learn the secrets to impressing them and other corporate recruiters. "Most people don't know what recruiters do," said Saoit, explaining the demand. "And certainly they haven't had many positive experiences with them."Job seekers should spend 60 to 70 percent of their efforts on networking, Saoit advised. Let everyone know you're out of a job, Houston added. People like to help, but "they can't help if they don't know you're looking." On average, 80 percent of job openings aren't advertised at all. Therefore, working with a recruiter and
networking may be the only way to hear about them. Saoit told the group to spend 30 to 40 percent of their job search on the Internet and to divide those hours equally among super job boards such as Monster.com, niche boards targeted to specific professions and websites of potential employers. Houston looks forward to the day when everyone is back to work and there's no demand for these workshops. "We would like recruiters to be the ones begging again," she said.
Network your resume to the right recruiters
Staff Writer, The Career News
LOS ANGELES, CA -- Are you are stuck in a rut and not getting phone calls for interviews? If so, it can make sense to use a recruiter to broaden your job search. It really makes sense if you are in a high level position since those jobs are not typically advertised or in an industry that traditionally uses search firms to fill vacancies. Search firms have contacts in industries and at companies that you might not even be aware of. They can help market your resume and provide you with additional exposure to potential employers that may not be advertising openings. If you don't know of any good recruiters, consider using a service that will email your resume to 100's of
pre-screened recruiters who are currently requesting resumes of people with your skills, in your geographic location. One of the more quality services like this we know is called Resume Mailman and can be found by going to this link.
References: Who ya gonna call?
Wendy Terwelp, Career Coach
MILWAUKEE, WI -- "Who are the best people to use as references and how many should I list? Is there a special format to follow when listing references? What information do I need to provide about my references?" said a reader.List three to six references -- recruiters tend to like six rather than three. People who make good references are: direct supervisors, co-workers, senior managers (president, vice president) -- work-related professionals. It's assumed that your good friends will say good things, so recruiters and hiring managers like to see work-related references instead of your friends. Leave out family members on the reference list -- even if you worked for a family
business. Find another manager to use who is not related. Provide work-related contact information as well including: Name, Title, Place of Work, Address, Phone, Email.Make sure you have personally contacted all of the people you want to use as a reference and get their permission. That way you'll have an idea of what they will say -- and if it's been some time since you've spoken with them -- who you are. And of course, you'll have all of their current information. Jobless benefits claims hit four-year low
Abridged: CIO Today
SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- A gauge of future economic activity slipped a bit in January while the number of laid-off workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in more than four years. The Labor Department reported that a total of 302,000 Americans filed applications for unemployment benefits last week, the lowest level since Oct. 28, 2000, when the country was nearing the end of a decade-long economic expansion. Last week, total claims fell by 2,000, the third straight weekly decline. The decline in jobless claims caught analysts by surprise. They had been forecasting an increase of around 12,000. Analysts said the decline in claims
provided further evidence that the labor market is continuing to show improvements with fewer layoffs and more companies deciding to hire new workers. Even though the last recession ended in November 2001, companies kept laying off employees until the summer of 2003 as they succeeded in getting more output from their existing work force. That effort gave the country strong gains in productivity but also contributed to a sustained jobless recovery. However, in 2004, payroll jobs increased by 2.2 million.

Employers use GPS to monitor employees
Abridged: Society of Human Resource Managers
KANSAS CITY, MO -- Experts predict that the number of mobile workers in the United States will grow from 92 million in 2001 to 105 million in 2006. With that big an employee base outside the four walls of the workplace, more and more employers are using GPS to monitor the movement and flow of employees, goods, services and transactions. It has caught on in the cable/broadband industry, among construction employers, courier and delivery services, employers in facility and waste management, security and fire prevention firms, carpet cleaners, plumbers, painters, the transportation industry, landscaping contractors, pest control companies, and distributors of everything from beverages to
building supplies.Employer use of global positioning (GPS)-based employee monitoring is a wave that hasn't even begun to crest. But privacy experts are saying it's the prime workplace issue to watch in 2005. And as GPS use grows, so does controversy over whether it threatens employee privacy.
Benefits of starting your own business
Staff Writer, The Career News
LAS VEGAS, NV -- Are you dissatisfied with the way you're being treated by your current employer? Perhaps you're an executive who has been displaced.

You've had the idea of owning your own business as a solution to these and other issues but you've heard all the horror stories about the failure rates of independent businesses. A franchise business may be the answer for you.A successful franchise is a network of interdependent business relationships that allows a number of people to share a distinct brand identification, a successful method of doing business, and a strong marketing,
distribution, and support system. If you would rather own a McDonald's than an independent burger drive-in, franchising may be right for you. In this case, we recommend you sign up for a free consultation with FranChoice, the premier "matchmaker" of the franchising industry.During your consultation, the consultants from FranChoice will help you identify franchise businesses that meet your criteria based on your goals, skills and preferences.

The resume pyramid
Deborah Walker, CCMC, Resume Writer and Career Coach
PORTLAND, OR -- If you've experienced writers block trying to construct your resume, it can be helpful to think of your resume as a three-layered pyramid. Thinking of the elements of your resume as a pyramid should help you to break down the complexity of your work history and simplify your resume's message.Layer  The pinnacle of the pyramid: Your
job focus. The top layer of the pyramid is your career focus. A clear focus, or objective, is the starting point of a great resume. Start with two or three closely related job titles right at the top of the resume. Employers and recruiters appreciate knowing right from the start what the candidate's objective
is.Layer  The pyramid mid section: Your selling points. The mid section of the pyramid is made up of your selling points that support your career focus or objective. Whatever your focus, determine your best selling points that allow you to stand above your competition.Layer  The base of the pyramid: Your accomplishments. The largest part of a pyramid is its base; likewise, your resume's supporting accomplishments comprise the largest part of your resume. Your accomplishments support your selling points, which in turn support your focus. For each selling point ask yourself "what was a significant Challenge I faced? What was the Action I took? What was the Result of my action?"

Government workers exploring job market
Abridged: WEHT.com
CHICAGO, IL -- Thirty-five percent of government workers say they are ready to move on to a new job in 2005, according to a recent survey by CareerBuilder.com. While the majority of government workers say they are satisfied with their current jobs, one fourth say they are dissatisfied and looking for positions with higher pay and higher titles. As is common in most industries, pay is often at the center of the debate. Four-in-ten government workers report dissatisfaction with their current compensation. Although 64 percent received a raise last year, more than half of these workers received salary bumps of three percent or less. "Competing with compensation levels in the
private sector has always been a challenge for managers in the public sector," said Stan Paul, General Manager of CareerBuilder.com's Government Services. Some government workers point to a lack of competent leadership as a hindrance in achieving their desired goals. Thirty-four percent feel their supervisor is falling short in meeting employee needs. One fourth of these workers say they were overlooked for a promotion in 2004 and are ready to take advantage of impending vacancies to speed up their career progress.
'Fax' you need to know about job searching
Staff Writer, The Career News
VIRGINIA BEACH, VA -- Have you spent hours upon hours in your job search only to find that you get few responses back no matter how many resumes you email? These days emails are being deleted at a significant rate without ever being opened. That's because many hiring managers are simply overwhelmed with the amount of emailed resumes they have to go through. Consider a different approach. Try faxing your resume directly to employers you're interested in. Unlike email, when you fax your resume the recipient can't delete it without opening it. Moreover, if your faxed resume is addressed to the actual decision maker, it almost always ends up on that person's desk and gets reviewed.
If this sounds like a good idea to you, we recommend using JobsByFax. This company has categorized 3.9 Million employers into about 73 categories. They'll quickly fax your resume directly to the exact type of employers you want in your selected geographic areas. To find out how many employers they have that match your criteria just Follow this link.
Career search fear: The Impostor Phenomenon
Pat Schuler, Business Development Coach
MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- Do you ever feel like your successes are nothing but luck or coincidence? Do failures and mistakes loom large in your mind and stay with you long after any victory has faded? Do you expect that sooner or later those around you will figure all this out and your career will come crashing down around your ears? Our perceived inadequacies are rarely more in our face than during the pain of career transition.How do we deal with our feelings of imposture? One way is to ask for candid feedback from co-workers, business associates and friends. You'll be amazed how positive that feedback is for most of us. If that doesn't work for you, hire a career coach to give you
brutally honest assessments of what you really bring to the party. These experienced professionals see hundred of people like you each year and hold a broad view. For some, this fear can be disabling. If this is a reason you're having trouble moving forward aggressively in your career search, get professional counseling to gain coping skills and put your concerns in perspective.
Forecasts indicate manufacturing job growth in 2005
Abridged: OCJobFinder.com
ORANGE COUNTY, CA -- Based on the California Employment Development Department's preliminary numbers, Orange County's manufacturing industry ended 2004 on a good note. Manufacturing employment in the county in December was 181,500, an estimated 300 jobs higher than in December 2003. In the area of durable-goods manufacturing, employment was up by 400 jobs in December 2004 over the same time last year, based on the EDD's figures. Jobs were gained in fabricated -metal-product manufacturing, computer- and electronic-product manufacturing, and transportation and equipment manufacturing; job losses occurred in machinery manufacturing and miscellaneous manufacturing.Forecasts
for manufacturing employment in Orange County from Chapman University's A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research are somewhat mixed. In its June 2004 Economic & Business Review, the center anticipated that average employment in 2005 would be higher than in 2004, with a 0.7 percent gain in non-durable manufacturing, a 0.8 increase in high-technology manufacturing and a 0.6 rise in durable-goods manufacturing. In the area of high-technology manufacturing, a peak is expected in the first quarter of 2005, but employment in the fourth quarter of 2005 is still expected to exceed fourth-quarter employment in 2004.

Attire closely linked to professional image
Abridged: OfficeTeam.com
MENLO PARK, CA -- Those looking for a promotion may first want to look inside their closets, a new survey suggests. Eighty-one percent of employees polled said a person's work attire affects his or her professional image; nearly half (46 percent) of respondents said wardrobe significantly impacts how someone is perceived on the job.The survey was conducted by an independent research firm for OfficeTeam, a leading staffing service, and includes responses from 972 men and women 18 years of age or older and employed in professional environments. "People tend to form immediate impressions of each other," said Diane Domeyer, executive director of OfficeTeam. "Dressing professionally
provides instant credibility and signals to clients, customers and colleagues that they're working with someone who takes the position seriously."According to Domeyer, more conservative attire is gaining popularity within many organizations. "During the economic downturn, professionals began dressing less casually, and this trend continues," she said. "But this shift may not be reflected in company policies - employees should heed the 'unofficial dress code' by observing what their supervisors and other managers within the company are wearing."

Preparing for the unprepared interviewer
Deborah Walker CCMC, Resume Writer and Career Coach
MIAMI, FL -- Have you ever walked out of a job interview and thought, "That was the stupidest interview I ever sat through. They didn't ask me any of the questions I'd prepared for!" If you have, you're not alone. Interestingly, most job seekers put themselves through rigorous training and preparation for interviews, whereas not as many employers spend adequate time or thought on the best-practice methods of candidate selection. So, how do you prepare for the 'stupid' interview?Preparing for the stupid interview means learning how to create opportunities within the interview session that allow you to demonstrate your expertise -- even when the right questions aren't getting
asked. Before your interview, be prepared with two magic questions that make you look great: 1) What do you see as the greatest challenges in filling this position? 2) What are the most important qualifications you're looking for in the perfect job candidate?If you get to the end of the interview and have had no opportunity to share your grand accomplishments, then throw one or both of these questions out to the interviewer. If the interviewer grants you a couple extra minutes, share a few of your accomplishments that illustrate your qualifications and how you have met and excelled in similar challenges.

Finding recruiters who'll find you jobs
Staff Writer, The Career News
You are a motivated, career-oriented professional. You have a strong work ethic and you will work hard to get the job done. So, why are you having such a difficult time finding a job that best suits you? Wouldn't it be great to find a job where you can get paid and enjoy? Recruiters are in the business of matching the right job candidate for the right job. They are constantly on the lookout for people with the skills and personality that fit the companies they help recruit for. Here's how it works. Recruiters, otherwise known as headhunters or search consultants, are hired by companies to find qualified candidates for them. And, they usually know about
unadvertised jobs - the kind of jobs that might be perfect for you.We at The Career News know how frustrating it can be to feel like the search for a stellar job is a dead-end one. We understand how it may sometimes look like there's "no light at the end of the tunnel."

Online job ads jump in January
Abridged: Reuters.com
NEW YORK, NY -- Employers posted more job openings on the Internet in January, a recent report said, suggesting the labor market may have kicked off the year on a positive note. Online job advertising giant Monster.com said its employment index surged to 120 last month from 113 in December. It was the highest reading since the index was first released in October 2003. "The index's strong growth in January ... offers more compelling evidence of U.S. labor market growth," Monster said in a statement. Also in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payroll employment increased by 146,000 in January and the un-employment rate
decreased to 5.2 percent. Job growth continued in several service-providing industries, while manufacturing employment declined over the month. While the U.S. economy has been growing robustly for almost two years, employment has been lagging behind during that time.
Online websites your resume be should on Staff Writer, The Career News
LOS ANGELES, CA -- Online job advertising is increasing and hiring managers are reporting a higher number of open positions to fill than in months past. Many of these recruiters and employers turn first to their career websites accounts to search for currently available qualified candidates. Buy not all hiring managers search the same career websites. There are hundreds of them. Many use the smaller sites because they're less expensive to search and still have plenty of great job candidates. The challenge for job-seekers is knowing which sites your resume should be posted to.While it may take some time, posting your resume on all the best sites, large and small, is the best way
to maximize your job opportunities. If you want the exposure but also want to avoid spending 60 hours filling out up to 75 or more web forms, consider letting a service like Resume Rabbit do the work for you. Fill out just one easy form and in about 15 minutes you'll be posted on 75 top career sites like Job.com, CareerBuilder, Net-Temps, Dice and more. A comprehensive list of all the sites they post to is on their home page.Whether you do it by hand or use a service like Resume Rabbit, creating accounts on all the best career sites will give you access to millions of jobs and exposure to 1.5 million employers and recruiters searching these sites for job candidates daily.

Identifying your transferable skills
Deborah Walker CCMC, Resume Writer and Career Coach
LOS ANGELES, CA -- I had a phone conversation yesterday with a job seeker who's had months of frustration since being laid off. She's been finding it very difficult to get interviews for jobs outside of her field because she hadn't identified her transferable skills. Here's a little exercise I shared with her to help her identify and communicate her transferable skills to potential employers. First, look up job descriptions on major job boards for positions that interest you. They don't have to be jobs you've done before. They just need to be jobs that sound like something you could do and enjoy. Also, don't worry about geographic location - the job descriptions are only
examples. Next, go through the job descriptions and identify the skills needed to perform the job. For instance - project management, customer service, handling high levels of stress, managing a team or working independently. Now, go through your employment history and find examples of accomplishments that illustrate your strength in those skills.Use the list of accomplishments to create a "Skills Summary" section at the top of your resume. With your transferable skills right at the top, where first impressions are made, you'll catch employers' attention much quicker and get calls for interviews more often. Need a job? Uncle Sam wants you
Abridged: USAToday.com
WASHINGTON, DC -- Need a job? Have a background in security, health and medicine or the sciences? If the answer is yes, the federal government wants you. Uncle Sam will need to fill more than 37,500 security and law enforcement-related jobs in the next two years, according to a first-of-its-kind survey on the employment needs of the 15 largest departments and nine independent agencies that represent 95% of the federal work force.The government expects to hire more than 25,700 doctors, nurses, pharmacists and medical technicians over the two-year period, along with more than 23,800 workers with expertise in engineering and the sciences - physicists, chemists, biologists,
botanists and veterinarians, the study says.The report says the government is facing an employment shortfall because of scores of anticipated retirements among the baby boomers in its ranks and the reluctance among job seekers to pursue careers in the much-maligned federal bureaucracy. The federal government today is under crisis," Max Stier, president and chief executive officer of the Partnership for Public Service, said in an interview. "You're seeing broad hiring needs across many agencies that will be necessary for the federal government to get the job done."

Job Seekers: How much follow up is too much?
Pat Schuler, Business Development Coach
MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- How many ways can our fears haunt us during our job search? Have you ever shared one of your fears and had a friend say, "Well, that's a stupid thing to worry about. That's never going to happen." How can you tell if a fear is reasonable? Diving out of the way of an oncoming car is a reasonable response to a reasonable fear. Most of us would agree with that. One big fear: If I call a prospective client or hiring manager too soon or too often, I'm afraid I'll jeopardize the sale or job. Like so many things, this issue depends on, and calls for a degree of judgment. Calling 10 times each day is probably not your best course of action. Your best antidotes
to fear are information and clear expectations. Ask the prospect or employer what's a reasonable time to check back, and how they'd like you to pursue the matter if you don't reach them live. They'll respect the question, give you clear guidelines, and you'll know how to proceed without antagonizing anyone. Then you have one fear you can check off your list.

What is your experience worth?
Pat Schuler, Business Development Coach
MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- In our youth obsessed culture, it can seem as though experience and wisdom have small perceived values. Have you heard someone say, "That's a young person's job/career/game?" Some of us do want to slow down and smell the roses. Others feel they've paid their dues and no longer want to work hundred-hour weeks. Ask yourself, "What do I really want?" and be crystal clear on your answers. Is being on the road two weeks at a time your idea of heaven or hell? Put yourself in the shoes of the interviewer, who may be half your age. What concerns does she have that she may not be voicing? Are you selling your years of experience short? Or as motivational
speaker Jim Rohn asks, "Do you really have one year of experience fifteen times?" What do you offer that most younger candidates do not? If you really believe you bring value to an employer, be prepared to explain why, clearly and succinctly. Think in terms of bullets on a PowerPoint presentation. The interviewer will frequently take her cue from your attitude and your confidence in yourself, not just your words.

Unemployment rate drops, job-creation disappoints
Abridged: United States Department of Labor
WASHINGTON, DC -- The U.S. economy added 146,000 jobs last month as unemployment decreased to 5.2 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today. The unemployment rate was down from 5.4 percent in December and 5.7 percent in January last year. But the job-creation number disappointed economists, who say a healthy economy must add 150,000 to 175,000 jobs each month just to absorb new entrants into the labor force. In December, 132,000 jobs were created.The education and health-services fields added jobs last month, as did transportation and warehousing, financial activities and retail. However, manufacturing jobs declined by 25,000.
Is it time to say goodbye to your old job?
Abridged: ABCNews.go.com
ATLANTA, GA -- As the majority of your waking hours are spent on the job - an average of 42 hours a week according to a recent Gallup poll - ideally, work should be satisfying. Given the weakened state of the job market over the past few years, however, most people have been happy to simply have a job and have not paid particular attention to their satisfaction meters.If you have tried to make the best of your job situation and it is still making you miserable, it may be time to say goodbye. However, you should not make any rash decisions. Ideally, you should have another job lined up before you resign from your current job, and it is especially important that this new job not
mirror the same environment you are trying to escape. It is essential to carefully plan for your departure because searching for a new job can be expensive. As such, you should build up as much of a savings cushion as possible - at minimum, three to six months of living expenses. Regarding your benefits, do a complete review of everything you currently have, are entitled to and will leave behind when you leave your firm.
Find the right recruiters to land your next job
Staff Writer, The Career News
NEW YORK - When looking for a job, you may want to consider working with a recruiter. Recruiters, otherwise known as head hunters or search consultants, are hired by companies to find candidates for them, and often know about unadvertised jobs.It's important to note, that recruiters do not charge the job seeker. The company pays a fee, typically when a candidate is hired. When contacting a recruiter send a resume and cover letter just as though you were applying for a job. If a recruiter calls you, always call back - even if you are not currently job hunting. You never know when circumstances might change and you might need job search assistance. If you don't know of any
good recruiters, consider using a service that will email your resume to 100's of pre-screened recruiters, who are currently requesting resumes of people with your skills, in your geographic location. One of the more quality services like this we've found is called Resume Mailman and can be found by going to this link. Tips on resume page length
Deborah Walker CCMC, Resume Writer and Career Coach
NEW YORK, NY -- A job seeker emailed me with a question this week about resume length. His issue may have crossed your mind as well. In the old days the assumption was a proper resume is always one page. Thank goodness that idea is dead. My answer to the question was that it's really a matter of relevant content. Resume information should include only what is relevant to the job seeker's objective. A resume that includes information not relevant to the objective is not only too long, but cluttered and confusing to read. Think of a McDonald's TV ad. When McDonald's writes commercials targeting kids they don't talk about nutritional value. Likewise, if your objective is a
sales position, it's probably not relevant to highlight your experience as an accountant. Mention the experience briefly. Make sure that your career experience warrants more than one page or you risk being labeled a rambler who doesn't know how to make a point. When in doubt, hand your resume to a friend and ask them to point out any information they see that doesn't relate to your objective. If your resume is confusing to them, it could be confusing to the HR assistant or recruiter who will read your resume.

Working from home - is it for you?
Abridged: Onrec.com
LOS ANGELES, CA -- Over the last few years there has been a huge growth in the numbers of people working from home. This has been caused by the increased use of the internet and mobile phones facilitating the ability to work wherever we like. There are obvious advantages to home or remote working. The most important being the work-life balance is much improved without the time wasted going to work every day on the congested roads.The reality is, however, that it doesn't suit everyone. Being alone day after day with no social interaction can be very lonely. For those individuals prone to depression working from home can become a nightmare with the distinction between work and
home becoming a blur. While it is not for everyone, working from home is ideal for self-starters who can discipline themselves so that there is a clear distinction between work and home.Other considerations to take into account before beginning to work at home include making sure the type of work is adaptable to home-working. Security of information and data protection should also be a high priority.

How many jobs are really out there?
Abridged: Bizjournals.com
PORTLAND, OR -- We gauge job vacancy rates by tracking "help wanted" ads. But the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, with responsibility for Hawaii and the U.S. West, says factors not tied to unmet labor demand can skew that measure. FRBSF Research Adviser Rob Valletta, in a report summarizing research in this area, says the help wanted ads may actually underreport job openings because so many employers are shifting recruitment to internet web sites."The job vacancy rate, which represents employers' unmet labor demand, is an important indicator of the short-term outlook for hiring and job creation," Valletta writes. "Because there is no continuous aggregate vacancy series in
the United States, analysts and observers have relied on the Conference Board's Help-Wanted Advertising Index to measure changes in job vacancies over time. This index is based on counts of help-wanted advertisements in major newspapers nationwide." Valletta says help wanted ads also are skewed by the fact that white-collar jobs are more likely to be advertised than blue-collar jobs. But the yardstick still has value. "The help-wanted index possesses the advantage of being available for nine broad regions comprising the entire United States," Valletta notes.
Internet web sites your resume be should on
Staff Writer, The Career News
LOS ANGELES, CA -- Recruiters are reporting a higher number of positions to fill than in months past. And most are turning to career websites to instantly find qualified candidates currently on the market. However, with so many available candidates, and the large fees charged them by the biggest job boards, many hiring managers have turned to a variety of the smaller job boards to look for new employees. So while it may take some time, posting your resume on ALL the best sites, large and small is the best way to maximize your job opportunities. If you want the exposure but also want to avoid spending 60 hours filling out 90 web forms, consider letting a service like Resume Rabbit

Three interview tips for taking age off the table
Jean Cummings, Executive Resume Writer CONCORD, MA -- With more than 60% of executives reporting age discrimination in the job search (ExecuNet), people are increasingly wondering what they have to do to get a job in the second half of their careers. How do you handle the interview to make your age insignificant?Interview Preparation. Research the company. Be able to intelligently talk about the company's current challenges and initiatives. Use your 'extensive experience' and 'large knowledge base' to think about ways in which you could benefit the company going forward. Body Language in the Interview. Present yourself as 'vigorous and engergetic'. Avoid leaning back and looking too
relaxed. Interview Strategy Related to Age. Legal considerations will probably prevent an interviewer from asking your age. However, he or she may well be thinking about it. So stress the value-added benefits you offer as an experienced professional. Give examples of how you used your experience to avoid costly errors and false starts. Give examples of cases in which your 'judgment and experience' made money, saved money or solved problems.
Entrepreneurs: In myself I trust
Suzanne Mulvehill, MBA
LAKE WORTH, FL -- I tried trusting money, that didn't work. I tried trusting success, that didn't work either. I need to trust myself and the process before money or success can come to me.Trust is at the core of experiencing the success we desire. This core or foundation is built on trusting ourselves and trusting the process. You may ask, "How do I simply trust the process when I don't know where I am going?" The answer is to know and trust that wherever you are being led is for your highest good. When we believe what is happening in our lives is for our highest good, we can trust ourselves and trust the process.Trusting can be difficult. In order to trust, we need to
let go of control. We need to let go of how we think things are supposed to work out. We usually don't think we need to let go of control until we have reached a point in our lives when our way, the way we think things should be, doesn't work. It is at this point we have a choice. We can either let go of control and start trusting or we can try to control our lives even more. Learn how you can own your own business Staff Writer, The Career News

Tips to preparing your electronic resumes Roberta Gamza, Career Marketing Consultant
DENVER, CO. -- You've developed a great paper resume. The content is right, the format is right. To post it to job boards or submit it to company web sites, you'll need an electronic version of that great resume, a stripped down file that is simply words, no graphics, fonts, or formatting - an ASCII text file. If you don't prepare an electronic version, the resume you send will not be the one received. Open the formatted file in the original application:   Set top and bottom margins to 1-inch.  Set left and right margin to 2-inches. Use a separate line for each element of your address. Save the file as plain text open the file in a test
editor.Keep the line length to 60 characters.Clean up the formatting.  Replace unsupported characters with ASCII characters (such as an asterisk instead of a bullet).Left justify all text.Separate headings with white space or ASCII characters.Delete unnecessary information and save the file.
Attitude and networking are crucial to finding a job
Abridged: Delawareonline.com
ROCHESTER, NY -- The new year, typically a time of optimism and desire for a fresh start, is the perfect time to jump-start a job search. So how can a job searcher capitalize? It starts with having the right attitude, experts say. "The important thing ... is to say, 'I'm going to regroup, take a breath, and then come the first of the year, it's back to business,' " said Carol Silver Elliott, president and chief executive of Career Development Services in Rochester, N.Y. Then it's back to networking. "I can't say enough about networking," said Matthew Hurlbutt, executive director of RochesterWorks, a job-training center. "How important that is for people to get their foot in the
door and leverage an opportunity where there might not appear to be one." So where might job seekers find success in 2005? Many small manufacturers, especially in tooling and machining, are aggressively looking for workers. Employers in the health care sector also expect to hire scores of workers in 2005, and companies that provide services to the medical fields also are growing.

Try a different approach to your job search Staff Writer, The Career News
VIRGINIA BEACH, VA -- Have you spent hours upon hours in your job search only to find that you get few responses back no matter how many resumes you email? These days emails are being deleted at a significant rate without ever being opened. That's because many hiring managers are simply overwhelmed with the amount of emailed resumes they have to go through. Consider a different approach. Try faxing your resume directly to employers you're interested in. Unlike email, when you fax your resume the recipient can't delete it without opening it. Moreover, if your faxed resume is addressed to the actual decision maker, it almost always ends up on that person's desk and gets reviewed.
If this sounds like a good idea to you, we recommend using JobsByFax. This company has categorized 3.9 Million employers into about 73 categories. They'll quickly fax your resume directly to the exact type of employers you want in your selected geographic areas. To find out how many employers they have that match your criteria just

Review: free business cards from VistaPrint Staff Writer, The Career News
Are business cards really necessary in this information age? You better believe they are. There is simply no substitute for getting out there and networking during your job search. Handing out your business card is a great way to keep them remembering you.As you make your way through the hordes of people at career fairs and trade shows or have meetings with various executives, HR staff and other career contacts you may have, you must always carry a fresh supply of business cards to hand out when the time is right. There's nothing worse than making a great contact, searching for a pen and writing your number on a napkin - that they're sure to lose. Personal business cards
project an image of professionalism and leave a lasting impression. However, if you think that creating a personal business card is time consuming, expensive and you must have a design background and creative flair, think again. At The Career News, we came across a website called VistaPrint that offers business cards at no charge to you - we thought we'd better find out all the facts before buying in. So, we placed our order. We were intrigued (though, admittedly skeptical) by the fact that the cards could actually be "no cost", so we clicked on the "free" link on the home page. Immediately, we were taken to a page where we could choose from various business
card templates - from wild and colorful to simple and understated. We picked one that was somewhere in the middle and moved on to the next step. Next, we were asked to enter in some general information - name, title, company name, contact info, etc. - and then we chose to preview our selection. We were able to make changes where we wanted, as many times as we needed. It was so straightforward and so easy to use. And, we had still not paid a cent.Once we had finished creating the business card of our choice we were asked to pay just the small shipping and handling fee, and our business cards were on their way! We received them about a week later and were very impressed with the quality of the card, the vibrancy of the color
and how professional the cards looked all together. VistaPrint's service was everything it promised to be - user-friendly, quick and no cost to you. Our cards were professional, clean and we were ready to start networking with confidence. To try VistaPrint's business card offer, follow this link.

Job Seekers: Develop your second nature
Suzanne Mulvehill, MBA, Excerpt from Employee to Entrepreneur
LAKE WORTH, FL -- I've worked long and hard on becoming more self-assured and now I am. I can feel it and see it in how I relate to people, how I express myself. Our second nature is a set of attributes or strengths that are learned and practiced so much they become part of who we are. They are necessary if we want to change and live our lives differently. Our learned strengths are important because, like our natural strengths, they connect us to our passion. They help us move in the direction we want to be moving. Developing a second nature is challenging. It requires patience with ourselves as we work at developing these new attributes and periodically falling back into our
old, familiar ways. It also requires the ability to avoid stressful situations and overextending ourselves -- both will return us to what is familiar -- the old habits we're working to avoid. Taking good care of ourselves emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually is important to maintain the effectiveness of our second nature. What strengths do you need that you do not naturally have? For example, do you need to learn to save money or become comfortable talking with people you do not know?

Job seekers face different challenges
Abridged: The Seattle Times
RESTON, VA -- Although it's illegal to discriminate based on pregnancy, there are still many cases of women fired or not hired for positions because of pending motherhood. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission received 4,649 charges of pregnancy-based discrimination in fiscal 2003. It resolved 4,847 charges and recovered $12.4 million for the charging parties that year. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act allows an annual 12 weeks of unpaid leave for workers at an employer of 50 or more people who have worked for at least a year. Many women have no leave time when they start a new job. Some who are pregnant and job searching find it necessary to reveal a pregnancy
so that maternity leave can be negotiated along with salary and benefits. "For highly skilled women, it is changing," said Jodi Grant, director of work and family programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families, formerly the Women's Legal Defense Fund. "But for a lot of women, there is still discrimination out there."
Networking isn't so bad; it's just talking
Abridged: Belleville News Democrat
ST. LOUIS, MO -- The business world is rife with jargon and buzzwords, with "networking" one of the most popular. Still, this much-practiced, little-understood ritual of career advancement and business protocol drives many people bonkers -- it's stilted, degrading, obnoxious, obsequious and insincere, right?Not necessarily, said Marc Karasu, a career counselor and vice president at Yahoo HotJobs. Consider networking akin to casual small talk at a social gathering, where you're doing it with ease, among acquaintances, thoughts of work and commerce a million miles from your mind. Be relaxed and act relaxed. You're just chatting -- not looking for a new job, sale or
promotion."Networking, simply put, is conversations held with friends, family, colleagues and others that help you garner information that could be helpful to your job search," Karasu said in an e-mail. "That means it can occur at almost any time -- not just at formal 'networking events,' but at sporting events, holiday parties or even at the gym."
Network your resume to the right recruiters
Staff Writer, The Career News
NEW YORK, NY-- When looking for a job, you may want to consider working with a recruiter. Recruiters, otherwise known as head hunters or search consultants, are hired by companies to find candidates for them and often know about unadvertised jobs.It's important to note that recruiters do not charge the job seeker. The company pays a fee, typically when a candidate is hired. When contacting a recruiter send a resume and cover letter just as though you were applying for a job. If a recruiter calls you, always call back - even if you are not currently job hunting. You never know when circumstances might change and you might need job search assistance. If you don't know of
any good recruiters, consider using a service that will email your resume to 100's of pre-screened recruiters, who are currently requesting resumes of people with your skills, in your geographic location. One of the more quality services like this we've found is called Resume Mailman. To network your resume to the right recruiters, follow this link. Neutralize age discrimination in the future
Jean Cummings, President, A RESUME FOR TODAY
LOS ANGELES, CA -- What can you do long-term to protect yourself from age discrimination down the road? Here are two critical strategies to implement:Build Your Personal Brand. Start now to build a robust personal brand in your industry and function. Make sure that all your communications reinforce that brand. Consider building a personal website to present your value proposition and to influence the content that shows up when a hiring authority performs a Google search on you.Network to Communicate Your Brand. Network on an ongoing basis with peers, former colleagues, former bosses and members of online and offline industry organizations. One of your contacts may well be
in a position to help you with job referrals in the future. Networking into an organization on the basis of an
 insider's recommendation will do a lot to neutralize the effects of age concerns.By building your personal brand and
turbo-charging your network, you are developing powerful antidotes to age discrimination in the job market.
Summer job advice: Don't dawdle
Abridged: The Arizona Republic
PHOENIX, AZ -- If you think you've had a hard time in this ho-hum job market, try trading places with your teenager. Some experts say teen job hunters were hit the hardest during the economic downturn, especially when trying to find work for the summer.Analysts and employers stress this piece of advice for teens: Don't dawdle. "The outlook for this summer is just as weak as last summer," said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. He figures that just 35 percent of teens who wanted to work last summer actually found jobs. "The really smart teens are out there looking now," said Susan Landgraf, vice president of
training for Cold Stone Creamery. Teen employment rates are at record lows, but some hopeful economists say the improving economy has given businesses reason to hire young adults. Low unemployment numbers are good news for teens looking for work. This means they are in less competition with adults out of work and seniors returning to work, as was the case during the past few summers.
