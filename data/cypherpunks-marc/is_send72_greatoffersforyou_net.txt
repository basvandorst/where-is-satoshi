Technology                   Breakthroughs!
                  News for Forward-Thinking Investors
—400%                   Near-Term Share Price Growth Projection—
9.5                   million of the world’s most affluent people could now                   get personal Internet connections for the first time ever! That’s                   because…
This tech leader is about to                   end an embarrassing cruise ship nightmare that has kept their                   guests in the dark far too long!
Reported                   by: Ralph Daniels                   For Technology Breakthroughs Online
    As                         soon as a guest steps on board a cruise ship, it’s                         like walking backward ten years or so to a time when only                         a few tech-nuts had the luxury of the Internet in the                         home.
    Believe                         it or not, today’s cruise industry thrusts 9.5 million                         people annually into a technology backwater that’s                         as outdated as not having a phone or TV!
                           With that thought in mind, imagine the                         money you could make if you suddenly made the Internet                         readily available to every cruise ship passenger in the                         world! TechNews                             Growth Pick                                    In-Systcom
Near-term                                   projection:                                   400% / 6 months
                                  2,800%+ / 12-24 months*
*Analysis provided in this report.
Watch                                   for news due out very soon that could send share                                   prices up in a sharp immediate spike of 30%                                   to 50%!
   Surprisingly,                   until now, it couldn’t be done. The ship’s wiring                   (of all things!) simply didn’t allow it. And the metal                   structure makes a wireless system virtually impossible.
                     It has been the Achilles heel of modern cruise                   line technology. The most worldly, well-to-do passengers could                   not even offer passengers the same services common in a $50                   motel room. And fixing the problem has been no small matter                   either.
                     Updated wiring needed for Internet delivery                   would cost the industry over half billion dollars in                   direct costs and retrofitting downtime! But the company featured                   in this investors report broke that impasse, and they did it                   using the wiring already installed.
                     No wonder its technology is set to commandeer                   the entire cruise ship industry.
                     If you’re ready to profit from an unseen                   (to date!) explosive opportunity, you’ll want to learn                   all about this right now! Dear                 Profit-Seeking Investor:
                   This could be one of the most compelling business                 stories you’ll come across for some time.
            Imagine                 the money you would make by offering a population                           the size                 of New York City (about 9.5 million people) with in-home           Internet                 and e-mail access for the first time ever!
          Not                 just an ordinary population either, but one that is populated                           with wealth,                 education, and the desire to travel.
                   That’s what In-Systcom                 (ISYJ) executives figured a few years back when they pioneered                 an exclusive technology to deliver Internet and e-mail access                 on cruise ships, using the ship’s existing wiring!
                   That’s not all. They also pioneered the                 installation of in-cabin amenities as Video-on-Demand (VOD), Satellite                 TV, video gaming, interactive services, travel and entertainment                 booking, plus more!
                   Now, after three very successful pilot installations,                 (detailed later in this alert), and a fourth just completed, In-Systcom                 is now shipping its SeaLynx™ system, setting a course for                 full scale roll-out!
                   The scope of this business opportunity is staggering.                 The profit potential even more so.
   It’s why this                 undiscovered stock could soar by 400% near term…Growing                 a $5,000 investment to $20,000 or more in 6 months or                 less!
                   For investors seeking an aggressive play on                 a low-cost, high potential stock, this one could be a screaming                 bargain right now. Hovering at just .25 on the pink sheets, ISYJ                 has been holding well against the downside, offering a stable                 entry point pending big news and breakout announcements.
                   And that could come any day now.
                   In-Systcom has already deployed                 their SeaLinx technology on ships in the prestigious Silverseas                 cruise line and only days ago, announced their second deployment                 in the Oceania cruise line. (Press release 10/11/2004 BusinessWire)
                   That’s 4 vessels already, and more news                 is likely to be released in the coming weeks.
                   All this sets the stage for a move onto OTCBB…which                 is precisely where company Chairman and CEO, Will Riner, Sr.,                 is ready to take ISYJ.
                   From there, the breakout could unfold at a skyrocketing                 pace!
                   A $1 share price by July 2005?                    Invest in ISYJ now, you’ll be in at around                 .25 a share, just preceding the time when next    year’s investors                 could be clamoring for shares at $1 or more!
                   The independent investment advisor The Research                 Works projected ISYJ to trade at $1.05 by July 2005. From their                 report: “Management has suggested that the Silversea                 contract is the Company's model for the future. As In-Systcom                 negotiates with other cruise lines representing 40 ships and 32,000                 cabins, the Company expects to gross approximately $15 weekly                 per cabin in revenue as it expands.”
                   Expanding on those revenue figures yields stunning                 numbers. In North America alone,
                            215,000                 cruise ship cabins (berths) represents a total potential market                 for ISYJ                             of                 $167.7 million a year!
                            In-Systcom’s                 very reasonable growth strategy, which has been updated to                             50                 ships over 18 to 24 months, projects to revenues of $31.2 million                 a year             in                 2006! And at the current net profitability of around                 31% of gross revenue,                             that                 projects to about 17¢ EPS!
                            With                 aggressive growth companies typically trading at 30 to 40 times                 earnings,                             ISYJ                 could reasonably be a $6 to $7 stock in 24 months!
                   Longer term, perhaps                 24 to 36 months, ISYJ has all the potential to be                 a $7 to $10 stock…That’s 2,800% to 4,000% growth from                 today’s share price…
                  Offering                 investors right now the potential to start small                                               with                 minimal risk and hit the jackpot!
                   Just $2,000 invested                 today could return $54,000 to $78,000 in pure profit!
                   This is the kind of opportunity that could make                 your dreams come true. And the best part is, the technology is                 already installed and serving thousands of passengers right now.                 It’s just waiting to grow as more and more ships are outfitted                 with the In-Systcom SeaLynx system!
                   On the current installation schedule, ISYJ profits                 could be coming on fast. According to projections provided by                 CEO, Wil Riner, In-Systcom could reach first                 profitability as early as 2nd quarter 2005!
                   Companies on the pink sheets fantasize about                 the day when they may see revenues, let alone those that turn                 a profit! Yet In-Systcom is projecting profits                 just a few months from now! What’s more, the current installations                 are working as planned and revenues are beginning to flow that                 make profits in Q2/05 a very real probability.
                   Thus, this is one of those pivotal moments in                 a company’s life that marks a turning point for investors.
                   Do you invest now…or do you wait and miss                 the explosive price surge coming out of pink sheet valuations?
                   If you’re an aggressive investor, the                 answer should be clear.
                   At today’s share price, this could be                 one of the very best investment decisions you make.
  Even                     if you limited yourself to just a few thousand shares, you                     could turn a handsome profit in just a few months, with a                     very modest downside risk. What’s more, by buying now,                     you’ll be setting the stage for a major breakout in                     the future and a fat profit to pad your position!
                       Not a pipe dream.                     Not an R&D promise. It’s real, onboard, and                     happening now!
                       Since the In-Systcom is                     already operational on a number of ships, serving tens of                     thousands of passengers, you don’t have to wait for                     the sales department to prove that there’s a market                     either!
                       New orders should be coming in very quickly.                     Especially as cruise lines see the capabilities of their competitors                     grow. Rather than looking for customers, In-Systcom                     could be faced with the enviable problem of having them line                     up at the door!
                       Competition?                        Not any time soon! This is…
                       A Fantasy Island                     of profit opportunity!
                       You’ll love this part of the show…
                       Right now, there’s no competition                     to the In-Systcom technology! It’s                     the only show in town! If a cruise line wants Internet connections                     to the cabins, it has two choices. Dry dock and retrofit,                     or choose In-Systcom to interface with their                     existing systems.
The                           growing market… and only one source for a sensible                           solution!     According                           to more cruise industry statistics, about 87% (8.3 million                           passengers) of cruise ship passengers boarded North                           American cruise ships.
                             You know what that means, a whole                           city full of Americans with no personal access to the                           Internet, even for e-mail!
                             These are people who write big checks                           for first class service. It’s reasonable to think                           that the vast majority of them live by e-mail at home                           and at work. And since most cruises last more than a                           week, Internet access could be a make-or-break point                           about booking a cruise.
                             What’s more, the problem is                           getting worse.
                             Since the year 2000, the cruise industry                           has grown from 5.1 million passengers to 9.5 million.                           By 2010, the figures are expected to soar past 17million                           passengers!
                             And you’re going to deny these                           people access to the Internet?     Since                 most cruise ships were built years ago with wiring that did not                 anticipate a modern Internet, the cruise operators have had nothing                 to offer except on-board public Internet lounges.
                   That just doesn’t cut it in 2005!
                   The In-Systcom                 solution puts the Internet into every cabin on board!
                   Live sports shows and movies too!
                   From marketing perspective, this could be the                 right product at the right time for a growing industry. Once a                 cruise company makes the commitment to upgrade to in-cabin Internet,                 e-mail and interactive services, In-Systcom can                 have a fully operational system up and running in a matter of                 weeks, with no downtime and no disruption to normal cruise activities.
                   In-Systcom’s technology                 breakthrough came when it developed an interface that linked the                 existing phone wiring with the ship’s C-band or K-band com                 links. These com links provide the uplink and downlink needed                 to enable Internet and satellite TV access while the In-Systcom                 SeaLynx system manages the bandwidth possible on the room-to-room                 wiring network.
                   As reported by In-Systcom management,                 nobody else has this technology nor anything like it. What’s                 more, In-Systcom is not just targeting the cruise                 ship industry!
                   The resorts at cruise ship destinations face                 the same dilemmas. High-end resorts on remote islands face similar                 challenges providing guests with access to online entertainment,                 movies and sports programming that their American guests have                 come to expect.
                   Using In-Systcom technology,                 resorts could soon offer a complete menu of in-room entertainment,                 including Internet access and e-mail. That market adds millions                 more travelers to In-Systcom’s potential                 revenue equation.
                   Invest now in ISYJ and you could sit back and                 relax on a profit-making cruise of a lifetime. And, you can expect                 your investment will be well managed because even though In-Systcom                 is a relatively new company…
                   In-Systcom                 is commanded by a seasoned crew of technology and cruise industry                 veterans.
                   With veterans like this at the helm, you can                 be certain your investment will stay true to an aggressive growth                 course.

                   What                 you should do now to lock in this opportunity.
                   At the time of this writing, ISYJ has been trading                 at $0.25 per share, so this is the ideal opportunity to lock in                 a solid position with a small investment.
  Because                       of ISYJ’s aggressive growth plan is progressing now,                       you could see rapid share price gains in the coming weeks                       as news of ISYJ’s accomplishments is announced and                       investor interest grows.
                         It is reasonable that the current share                       price represents the very best entry point for new investors.                       However, as can be expected, this is a risky investment                       suitable only for aggressive investors willing to assume                       the risk of substantial losses.
                         Considering the current state of ISYJ’s                       growing business and very low price per share, a significant                       position in the company can be taken now putting just a                       modest investment at risk.
