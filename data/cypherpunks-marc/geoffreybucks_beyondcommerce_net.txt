In 1948, at the young age of 25, Charles Lazarus began a business totally dedicated to kids and their needs just in time for the post-war baby boom era. He had no idea that his first baby furniture store in Washington D.C., would evolve into an $11 billion dollar business with approximately 1,500 stores worldwide! How did Charles accomplish this incredible feat? By listening to his customers, of course. "I need a toy for my baby" was something he heard from guests over and over again when his store only carried baby furniture. So he began to sell baby toys and then when guests asked for toys for older kids, he began to sell these as well. Everything his guests wanted, Charles tried to give them, until Toys"R"Us became a full-scale toy store extravaganza! Your email address is cypherpunks
