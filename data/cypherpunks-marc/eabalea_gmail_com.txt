2013/10/4 Paul Wouters We're still using HMAC-SHA1 for most TLS ciphersuites, RSA(MD5||SHA1) for
TLS signatures (until TLS1.2), and RSA(SHA1) to sign (EC)DHE parameters.
SHA1 is still there.
There are alternatives, it doesn't hurt to get them in place.
RFC5639 standardized the curves, RFC7027 allows them to be used for TLS.
They're no more drafts.
