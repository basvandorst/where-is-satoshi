Security Review begins TODAY! Join the conversation at
Somehow I doubt they'll appreciate my perspective:
1) Completely eliminate the Department of Homeland Security
2) Remove all infringements on the right to keep and bear arms and
return to the homeland security the founders envisioned, the
unorganized militia.
It would be hard to even state my perspective at their site. It splits
the problem up into umpteen components, and expects you to comment on
them individually, assuming that their compartmentalization of the
problem is the only possibility.

Well, Ms. Caproni, which is it? Will we have strong encryption, or

I haven't seen details on how this works, but from the short
description on that Wikipedia page, which matches Google's
description, the PIN enables the NFC antenna, which allows the "Secure
Element" chip to communicate over the NFC radio link. The NFC station
can then query the Secure Element for the user credentials, which I
assume are sent encrypted with the credit card issuer's public key. So
you'd have to send transmission over the NFC radio link's limited
range that looks to the Secure Element to be coming from a credit card
issuer. Hopefully, the encryption between the credit card issuer and
the Secure Element is end-to-end, so there's no way for anybody else
to snoop on it. So if you can steal the PIN, hack the OS to simulate
that PIN being typed, while the user is close to an NFC station that
can impersonate a valid credit card issuer, you're golden. Sounds hard
to me.
Lots of guesses there, however. I hope Google will publish the
protocols. Maybe they already have. I didn't look.

Which is why the average random geek needs to be reminded, over and
over again, that you NEVER talk to the police. Not a word. Ever. If
you're feeling kind, write them a note, "I don't talk to police." They
should leave wondering whether you're mute.

You're right, of course. Governments will continue to behave as if
they own us, money or not. But you missed my point. I want no
government at all. Anywhere. I'm not proposing a system to replace the
current one, because I don't want it to be replaced. With what do you
replace cancer, except good health because the cancer is gone? Yes,
there will still be disagreements, and we'll invent ways to deal with
them, thousands of different ways, without giving anybody monopoly
power over anything.
But=85 way off topic.
One day I'll learn the crypto details of Bitcoin, if only to integrate
it with Truledger.

You've just made a very good argument for eliminating money, at least
government issued money. Yes, governments just love to assess taxes,
fees, and fines. No, I have no need of any of that.

That's the single charge on the complaint that might have some merit, but
apparently they have no body, nor any evidence that the victim even exists,
other than electronic messages. And, he was being blackmailed, in an
environment where he couldn't go to the authorities, since they would
arrest HIM, not the blackmailer. Another situation in which the drug war
causes unintended (or maybe not) consequences.
