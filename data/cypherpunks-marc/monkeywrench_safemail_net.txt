I think it is well past the time that someone did something effective about CAPPS I/II.  I hereby announce my Sparticus service for air and rail travelers desiring privacy from government tracking.  As cypherpunks have done in years past with their grocery cards, I will offer my identity for booking your next reservation.  So you will be sure I am as I claim, I will also offer high resolution image files of my driver's license, front and rear (my state's driver's license has no magnetic strip or other special security features).  Prepayment of your airfare plus a $10 service fee, in e-gold, will be required.  You will receive, in return, a single-use credit card number good for this amount.
I hope my effort will spur others to join my chorus of those shouting "I am Sparticus".
