Interesting but not really the same. They have right to search but can
not ask me to assist in their search. So they can search my laptop but
can not ask me to tell them where the "incriminating" files are.
So under fifth amendment protection they can not ask me to reveal the password.

Would not this be covered under rights guaranteed by constitution? Or
right not to reveal incriminating evidence against self?
