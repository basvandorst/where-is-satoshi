Indeed. When I received the email I assumed it was due to using Tor with
Twitter since that seemed to me to be the most likely reason. That, or
some detection algorithm used by TWitter was touchier than it should
have been, causing it to trigger when it shouldn't have.
After a couple of weeks (and finding no more than 46 confirmed "Persons
of Interest (by 'State Actors')", I'm at a loss as to why we received
it. Looking at the list members and our posts, nothing stands out as
being noteworthy.
