Lengthy, but timely, article from Electronic Frontier Foundation...Surveillance Self-Defense.
Under "What can I do to protect myself?" | "Encrypt Your Data":
"A lawyer may be able to get your property back if the warrant was improper, negotiate a deal with the government's attorneys to limit the search or get important files back, or convince the court to strictly limit the search so that they won't search files that are legally privileged (like confidential legal or medical records), protected by the First Amendment (like private membership lists), or irrelevant to the case.
Alternatively, a prosecutor may ask a judge to order you to turn over your password. The law is unclear on whether such an order would be valid, but that is a matter to face with the assistance of counsel. No one other than a judge can force you to reveal your password."

As they've had it for over a year, to what extend is "I really don't remember" a valid defense?
Good point...too bad for him he's not a billionaire CEO or a big wig Politician since 'loss of memory' seems endemic in that group.

What's interesting to me is that they've had this laptop for over a year now and it's surely had its share of 'heavyweights' trying to crack PGPs passphrase implementation or decrypt the files in other ways.
I'm not familiar with PGP...does it provide for Plausible Deniability?

Hi Denys
I doubt it's intentional jamming since I've had the same problem.
Aegis radar is very high power in full radiate mode and as such creates problems for Low Noise Amplifiers listening at 3.4-4.2 GHz.
Someone needs to talk to Microwave Filter Company.

I've seen Aegis radar interfere with C-band satellite communications (3720-4180 MHz.) which is used by all kinds of
services.

I quickly read through the indictment, but the gov't claims that when given a takedown notice, MU would only remove the *link* and not the file itself.  They specifically mention some movies that were still on the site years after the notice, thus negating MU's eligibility for safe harbor.
As you say, interesting for sure with the dotted i s and crossed t s.

It was further part of the Conspiracy that the content available onMegaupload.com and Megavideo.com was provided by known and unknown members of theMega Conspiracy, including several of the defendants, who uploaded infringing copies of copyrighted works onto computer servers leased by the Mega Conspiracy in North America tofurther the reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works; in particular, copyright infringingcontent was hosted by the Conspiracy on various servers in Toronto, Canada; Los Angeles,California; and Ashburn, Virginia (the last of which is in the Eastern District of Virginia)."

How about:
Police have seen CP and have logs from "Additionally, I was accused of sharing (and possibly producing) child pornography on a clearnet forum via an image hosting site that was probably tapped."
Police look at IP addresses that have accessed the images for those that are within their jurisdiction.
Police find an address within a block that is registered to Wiliam.
Police raid William and receive an education on TOR exit nodes on servers in Poland.
Why wouldn't the IP address have led to William?

Wouldn't Austrian LEA need possession/knowledge of this pr0n site in order to determine the exit node that was using it?

Isn't William's problem because he used an IP address that was registered to him on the Polish server?  If not, what am I SANS has chimed in via their latest Newsbites:
--TOR Operator Charged For Content Sent Through His Servers
(November 29 & 30, 2012)
An Austrian man who operated TOR servers has been charged with
distributing child pornography. Authorities detected the images passing
through the servers maintained by the man. Police seized 20 computers
and other equipment from William Weber's home. TOR is an acronym for The
Onion Router, a project developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory
that allows people surf the web anonymously. It is often used by
political dissidents, journalists, and law enforcement officers, and has
also been used by criminals. The offending images were being distributed
by a server in Poland and sent through Weber's servers. Weber operated
exit servers; traffic from these nodes can be traced back to the
servers' IP addresses. While the authorities became "friendlier" after
understanding where the images came from, there is a precedent for
holding TOR operators liable for content that passes through servers
they operate. The Electronic Frontier Foundations acknowledges the risk
that accompanies operating exit nodes and advises that "it's best not
to run your exit relay in your home or using your home Internet
[Editor's Note (Ullrich): IMHO, the TOR operator acted like a transit
ISP/NSP in this case.
(Hoan): In many countries it is not illegal to run a Tor exit node.
However, for anyone considering, or are already, running a Tor exit node
you should familiarise yourself with the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's Legal FAQ on the topic at

In your opinion, would it make *any* kind of semse to engage in child pron AND run an exit node?
