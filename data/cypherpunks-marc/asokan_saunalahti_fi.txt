@_subject: Re: Cryptogram: Palladium Only for DRM 
I agree with this in general.  One exception that comes
to mind is "theft protection". If my machine has some
secrets (e.g., to access my bank account) and a thief
gets hold of the device physically (so that he can access
the storage directly without the control of the OS), then MMU+software isn't enough. It seems some sort of smartcard
(or support from a server) would be needed.
The same applies to any data on my machine that should be
integrity-protected (e.g., the root key with which
I authenticate my bank).
I think tamper-resistant hardware could (if it worked)
offer protection to the owner of the machine against anyone
else who would have physical access to the machine. In other words, "Owner" is not the same as the "current user".
Your last comment is still valid though: Palladium etc. will
be more compelling if it demonstrably preserved the control
by the owner of a device (e.g., by allowing the owner to initialize the root keys used by it, as pointed out by
William Arbaugh).
