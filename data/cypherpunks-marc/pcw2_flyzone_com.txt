@_subject: An assault on liberty? 
I realize that many will use this event as an excuse for many political agendas, but I think it's important that we think through exactly what happened. It doesn't seem like it was an assault on liberty or a misuse of the liberties we have. Most people can't fly planes. The learning process is long and the licensing requirements are many. Flying a 757 is even more restricted by both cost and licensing requirements. It's not a liberty like walking around the streets or speaking one's mind.
It doesn't seem to me that this attack had anything to do with liberty. It's not like someone abused the right to bear arms by shooting someone, it's not like someone abused the right to speak freely by libeling someone, it's not like someone abused the right to drink alcohol by plowing into a school bus after drinking too much. These guys were unauthorized to have knives, they were unauthorized to have bombs, they were unauthorized to fly 757s, they were probably unauthorized to be in the country. Yet they did all of these despite the controls.
The hard lesson is that controls don't always work. Licensing requirements, security checkpoints, and armed guards fail. It's sad, but there's no physical law like gravity that we can depend upon to keep ourselves safe.
If you ask me, the biggest danger is that we'll add more ineffective security measures in the hopes of doing something.  And the real problem is the controls may never be enough to keep us safe.

@_subject: Baltimore Digital Commerce Society-- Korhammer on Lava Trading, 
This event was originally scheduled for October 2nd, but it is being pushed back to November 6th because Lava Trading used to be located on the 83rd floor of the WTC. Richard Korhammer's office was only 50 feet away from where the plane hit. Miraculously all of the company survived. Korhammer was across the street with a client during the entire event.
But please come to listen to hear about their company not about the WTC. They're almost back on-line after having their entire office destroyed.  These guys are building a very cool, cross-exchange tool. It constantly keeps track of the bids and asks on a number of exchanges letting you send your business to where the prices are best. It's fascinating to watch the screen update the quotes in real This kind of semi-automated, trading assistance is bound to become more and more prevalent. I think Lava Trading is doing some of the most interesting stuff around.
Baltimore Digital Commerce Society
Tuesday October 2, 12:30
Speaker: Richard Korhammer, CEO of Lava Trading (
Topic: Networks as Markets-- Why Exchanges are Becoming Virtual
Richard Korhammer is the CEO of LavaTrading, one
of the startup companies in New York diving into
cross-market arbitrage. Their network links
together all of the important market makers in
ECNs and keeps track of all bids and offers.
Buyers and sellers using the technology
automatically get pointers to the best price
possible. Traders with large blocks of stock do
substantially better because Lava Trading will
break up their block to match it with the best
price available across all of the markets. This
cross-market arbitrage improves liquidity for the
market and makes it simpler for traders with large
blocks of stock to wade into the marketplace
without leaving a wake.
In his talk, Korhammer will explore how fast
networking and sophisticated servers can
supplement and potentially replace the old
fashioned stock exchange. Traders won't need to
come to one place or one exchange to search for
the best price because the network can constantly
sort through all buyers and sellers. Korhammer
believes that adding intelligence to the network
and the servers supporting is more efficient than
requiring traders to manually manage an otherwise
complicated marketplace.
Will these cross-exchange tools supplant the
exchange? Will they eventually become the
exchange? Will the disintermediation eventually
make all trading a transparent event?

In any case, there are plenty of business uses of

everyone else who sees the document will never see
this number, but it's there. I think the serial
number is there to help them track down piracy and
copyright infringement.
The content creation companies from the music and
movie business are also big believers in
steganography. They hope the tool will allow them
to mix in copyright messages into digital copies.

@_subject: Re: Denning's Geo-crypto 
This is a fascinating idea, but problematic. The simplest approach
is easy to spoof. Let's say that you encrypt the data with the GPS coordinates
X. The software takes GPS coordinates from a GPS receiver and tries
to decrypt the data using these coordinates. Only someone at the
right place would be able to figure it out.
Naturally, this could be spoofed by replacing the GPS receiver
with one that spits out the right coordinates.
A better system might rely upon the signals from the satellites
themselves. The signals let the GPS receiver measure the
time the signal took to travel from the satellite to the receiver.
Knowing the distance from three or more satellites makes it
possible to triangulate and come up with the real location.
A more sophisticated system would encrypt the data with
these signals themselves. It might take the data coming from
satellites 1,2 and 3 at one particular instant. Only a person
in the right location would see the right values at that particular instant.
But I think this could be spoofed by time shifting the signals using
a TIVO-like mechanism. If you're not in the right location you
could pretend to be in another.
Maybe they have a more complicated mechanism. Or maybe
this is just FUD.

I went to a meeting in the WTC this spring. It took a half hour to get through security because they had to type all kinds of details into some computer and take my picture with a camera. It all seemed like a preposterous amount of security and rigamarole even after the 93 bombing. If they really cared about stopping attacks like that, they would do a better job guarding the garage and keeping track of the surveillance tapes after the fact.
On the floor of my meeting, though, I figured out what was probably going on. The floor held a number of offices including several branch offices of foreign banks. These weren't for passbook customers making deposits. They were the kind used to do big deals. My guess is that someone used the databases and photos of those coming and going for intelligence purposes.
Perhaps there was something more a foot too, but the concentration of financial deal making seems high enough to be worth the effort. The UN can be a 60+ minute drive by car.

These are very unsettling stories. But my favorite from recent days comes from the Oct 26 NY Times:
  "Federal prosecutors said Mr. Hanhardt used law enforcement computers and other databases to get information on traveling jewelry sales representatives, including itineraries and car rental information. Prosecutors said many of the thefts were from the rented automobiles. "
Mr. Hanhardt was Chief of Detectives for the Chicago Police Department. His gang, which operated from the early 1980's to 1998, reportedly stole more than $5 million. This may not be the best estimate because as part of his plea bargain, he's going to pay $4.8 million and cash equal to half of the equity in his home. There were 6 people in the gang. We probably don't know the full extent of his crime spree.

@_subject: Still more steganography tools. 
To help flog the second edition of Disappearing Cryptography and encourage a general education in things steganographic, I'm continuing to roll out Java applets on the book's website.
This week I've added a few new features to last week's applet that let you hide information in the noise of an image. That is, replace the least significant bits of an image with either an ASCII text message or random data. You can replace anywhere between 1 to all 8 of the image's bit plane. I think it's amazing how much you can stuff in an image before it starts to degrade.
The new features allow you to examine the least significant bits of an image. One option will delete the seven most significant bit planes and keep only the least. Another option lets you compare the most significant with the least, although it depends a great deal on the image.
This experiment has its problems. Video cards don't always offer enough precision. You'll get more consistent results if you use a higher setting on your video card. The JPEG images don't have enough resolution. Also, this system relies upon 24-bit color, a file format that's rarely found in nature. More sophisticated systems can target compressed images.

@_subject: Re: Fwd: Re: Fwd: Book Review: Peter Wayner's "Translucent 
I think Bob made some great points about my book, but it's clear that this debate
is revolving around a few sentences in Bob's review. Perhaps he miscategorizes
Brin, perhaps he doesn't. I haven't read _Transparent Society_ in some time.
Still, it's important to realize that this isn't just a battle between the state
and its citizens. Encryption can provide a practical tool and a great option
for the data management engineers. Brin has a good point about the value
of openness, but I'm sure he doesn't extend it to things like people's credit
card numbers. Brin would probably be interested in the book and the way
it leaves some things in the clear. It's all about translucency, which is, after
all, partially transparent. The glass is half empty or full. So maybe there's
something in common here?
The right use of encryption (and any anonymity that comes along with it) can
protect businesses, customers, clients, employees and others. I'm sure it
might also be used to by a few elites to avoid scrutiny, but that doesn't have
to be the case.
For me, the mathematics of on-line anonymity are essential parts of on-line security. While I think that there are plenty of personal and emotional reasons to embrace anonymity, one of the best is the higher amount of security the systems offer. Simply put, identity-based systems are more fragile because identity theft is so easy. Systems designed for anonymity avoid that weakness because they're designed, a priori, to work without names. So I think they're just bound to be a bit safer.
It should be noted that the anonymous techniques developed by Chaum, Brands and others do not have to be used to avoid scrutiny. You can always tack on your true name in an additional field. To me, the systems just avoid relying on the the name field to keep people I'm glad Bob sees the resonance between _Translucent Databases_ and the world of cypherpunk paranoia, but I would like to avoid a strong connection. It's not that there's no relationship. There is. But the book is meant to be much more practical. It explores how to use the right amount of encryption to lock up the personal stuff in a database without scrambling all of it. In the right situations, the results can be fast, efficient, and very secure. So the techniques are good for the paranoids as well as the apolitical DBAs who just want to do a good job.

@_subject: Re: The Case Against Steganography In Perceptually Encoded 
This is certainly a point that many people are coming to believe. But I think you have to be careful with taking it to extremes. Are there problems with changing the character of noise? Yes, but as you pointed out it may be possible to sculpt the inserted information to conform to the statistical character of the overall file. One of the simplest tricks is just to insert a relatively small message in a relatively large file. Any statistical changes will be lost in the noise. This is a pretty practical solution because there are plenty of images that take hundreds of thousands if not millions of bytes. A thousand bytes of text gets lost pretty quickly.
It's also important to remember that there are many tricks that avoid making changes in the usual way. I'm currently very intrigued with the potential to rearrange lists of items. (You can try out an applet here: I guess it's important not to let an obsessive attention to mathematical perfection  prevent you from accomplishing something cool. After all, every RSA key can be factored eventually, but we still use the system because it's practically secure.

Several months ago, I read about someone who was making a key that was difficult if not "impossible" to copy. They mixed sparkly things into a plastic resin and let them set.
