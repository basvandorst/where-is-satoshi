The example you're thinking of, I believe, comes from Peter Wason.
Imagine you have 4 cards on a table.  On visible side of the cards is D, F, 3, and 7.  You are asked to test the hypothesis "If a card has
a D on one side, it has a 3 on the other."  Which cards do you need to
turn over to test this?
Most people would say D, or D and 3.  The correct answer is D and 7.
You need to test that the D has a 3 on the back and that the 7 does not
have a D on the back.  Since the statement is expressed as an
implication (D -> 3), you don't need to check the 3 because it wouldn't
be relevant (3 !-> D).  It's pretty obvious why you wouldn't need to
check the F.
Now, reword this same test that almost everyone fails.  You are a
bouncer at a bar and are enforcing the rule "If a person is drinking
beer, he must be 18 or older."  You may check what people are drinking
or how old they are.  Which do you have to check:  a beer drinker, a
Coke drinker, a twenty-five-year-old, or a sixteen-year-old?  It's now
pretty obvious to everyone that you need to check the first and the
Peter Wason claims that the difference here is not just the concreteness
of one versus the abstraction of the other; his claim is that the
hypothesis "if a person eats hot chili peppers, then he drinks beer" is
no easier to prove false than the original card test.  It is only the
situation in which a person tries to detect cheaters that makes this
test easy. For more on this topic, see such books as Steven Pinker's "How the Mind
Works," a reasonable introduction to modern psychology.

Right, except that the co-pilot isn't just someone who could be the
co-pilot, he's the person acting as the co-pilot.  Just as there can
only be one person flying pilot-in-command, there's only one person
who can fly right seat, and the person actually doing so is the
co-pilot.  If that co-pilot died and someone else took over, that
person would then be the co-pilot.  Everyone else is just a passenger,
despite the fact that some of them may have a pilot's license.

I'm not sure about this, but I think that in this context "passenger"
is used in the general aviation sense---anyone who is not the pilot in
command is a passenger.  In effect, there can't be more than 10 people
on the plane in total.
Hopefully, I'm wrong about this.  If I am, however, I suspect that the
only other person on the plane who wouldn't count towards this total
would be the co-pilot.

The enhanced security regulations apply only to airplanes flying under
FAR part 121---airplanes with 10 or more passengers onboard.  Those
airplanes operating under FAR part 135 (9 or fewer passengers---what
most general aviation pilots fly) are not subject to the same security
procedures; for the most part, I'd expect that people and companies
who don't fly commercial airlines are more or less ignoring the
enhanced security bullshit.  (There are other requirements for FAR
part 121---max gross weight, etc.---but for the most part, you expect
that 10 or more passengers is 121, 9 or fewer is 135.)
Up until some time in 1997, pilots who were certified only for part
135 could still fly small commuter planes.  The Clinton administration
enacted the "single level of safety" rules that required all
commercial carriers to operate under 121, mostly due to pressure from
various interests after the several ValuJet-style crashes.  However,
charters and private airplanes are still almost exclusively operated
under 135.
As to your idea for a buy-in airline, the biggest problem is going to
be that you have to have 9 or fewer people on each flight.  Because of
that, it's going to be prohibitively expensive (you're going to be
investing $5M to $10M on the plane initially, plus operating costs
around $1k/hour of flight, if not more).

True, but if the customer wants low supply voltages, you're screwed.
Consulting a process guide I happen to have handy (it's a pretty
recent fast bipolar process), emitter-base breakdown is quoted at 2.6V
nominal, so I guess from anything greater than 2.6V + Vcesat supplies
(maybe 3V, certainly 3.3V, 5V), you're all set.  Of course, if you're
willing to sacrifice some current protection, put resistors on your
wafer, and reduce PSRR, you could go as low as 2.7V for the cost of
one 10 ohm resistor.
I don't have any detailed data on it handy, but there are some
indications in the same process guide that emitter-base breakdown
carries with it some pretty serious hot-carrier problems.  I believe
that over time this effect drops off (after the worst of it has had
its run), so the transistor won't continually degrade.  Furthermore,
most problems associated with hot-carrier effects won't concern us if
the transistor is being run only in reverse breakdown---you'll lose
some beta, BVeb might go down a little, etc.  Thus, you'll almost
certainly want to sacrifice the headroom and use a mirror to drive the
emitter instead of a resistor (else your breakdown will increase over
time, which will probably make the degradation more severe), but you
should be OK.
If I ever get the opportunity, I'll do some emitter-base burn-in
testing and see how the entropy of the output is affected by
hot-carrier-induced transistor degradation.
I've done some probing with way too much coffee.  The worst was
probing MEMS devices that way.  Man, oh man.  :-)

thermal noise, which makes it easier to detect and build circuits

Another nice way to get an RNG is Avalanche breakdown.  You can do
this with reverse emitter-base breakdown in a BJT, or with a diode.
This may take more voltage than you want to use in your process, but
you can engineer the base-emitter junction if you've got a friend in

@_subject: Re: Degrees of Freedom vs. Hollywood Control Freaks 
It's true that tubes distort differently, but not for the reason you
If you compare the transfer characteristics (Vce vs Ic with Vbe as a
parameter) of a tube to those of a transistor, you see that (using BJT
terminology) the transistor passes through saturation and reaches
linear operation at a relatively low Vce (triode/linear, saturation,
and Vds respectively, for you FETholes).  On the other hand, the tube
does not saturate quickly in this way.  If you draw a load line over
these transfer characteristics and grind through the math (or have
Matlab do the work), you'll see that BJTs and FETs produce mostly
odd-order harmonic distortion, whereas tubes produce more even-order
harmonic distortion.
The audible difference in this distortion is consistent with empirical
results from acoustic musical instruments: violins (and other stringed
acoustic instruments), which produce mostly even-order harmonics, have
a drastically different timbre from, say, a clarinet, which produces
mostly odd-order harmonics.
While I'm sure you're right that most people can't tell the difference
between .01% and .001%, I'm not sure I believe that _everyone_ likes
distortion (or, if they do, that everyone likes distortion of the same
kind or level.)  It seems that when you _re_produce a recording you
may as well do so with as much fidelity as possible, leaving it to the
artist to introduce whatever distortion they intend when they record
When I listen to Ormandy and Philadelphia perform Mahler 2 I want the
utmost fidelity; at the same time, I don't complain about the
distortion in the recording when I listen to the Smashing Pumpkins's
latest album.

Doing this would violate the HTTP CONNECT semantics described in the
IETF Internet-Draft "Tunneling TCP based protocols through Web proxy
servers" by Ari Luotonen.  Not that that's stopping anyone.
I've written a perl module, Net::HTTPTunnel, that allows you to make a
CONNECT tunnel through an HTTP proxy and treat it as a normal socket
object (it's very simple---it just handles talking to the proxy server
and returns an IO::Socket::INET object).  It's available on CPAN.
Note that most proxy servers are configured to allow CONNECTs only to
port 443 (https) and 563 (snews).  Of course, all you have to do to
get around this is run an ssh server on port 443 or port 563 on a
machine you control that lives outside the firewall.
Using the above-mentioned perl module, have a program listening for
connections on your machine inside the firewall which will, upon
receiving a connection, establish a CONNECT tunnel and forward packets
in both directions.  Now all you do is ssh to that port on your local
machine and tunnel any other protocols you want through the ssh
connection (for example, run squid on the machine outside the firewall
and forward a local port to the squid server across the SSH tunnel if
you wish to conceal your at-work browsing habits).  I'm using just
such a tunnel to write this email.
Of course, there are lots of ways to make tunnels.  A good friend of
mine used to tunnel through his high school's firewall using a program
he tossed off that would get the data back and forth through the
firewall in HTTP POSTs.  Sure, it's more complicated, but when his
school turned off CONNECTs to prevent the method described above, he
took it personally.
I think there's even a program out there that creates a (very high
latency!) tunnel using email.

In automotive power systems, the bigger concern is load dump.  When
there's a step change in alternator load from high to low, the commutating
inductances resulting from the field windings of the alternator can't
react quickly enough, and you tend to get big spikes on the power lines.
Perhaps this could be used to advantage---if you want to convince
someone that your electronics blew up on their own, blow up the
rectifier at the output of your alternator, too.

Sounds like a practical secure implementation of this will be very
difficult.  Consider that if Alice and Bob do not perfectly synchronize
the resistor transitions, there will be a window in which an attacker
will see a line that is unterminated at one end.  It's trivially easy in
this case to determine the resistance that has already been connected to
the line, and with proper equiment (e.g., TLP) it would also be possible
to determine which end of the line is unterminated.  Those two pieces of
information uniquely determine one bit of the key.
Or how about this: if the resistors are not perfectly matched, there is
a difference in resistance when Alice chooses low versus when Bob does,
leaking key information.  Beyond that, resistor properties change over
time, which requires that Alice and Bob calibrate their resistors to one
another on a regular basis. Any such calibration step gives Mallory yet
another way of corrupting the protocol.
I'm sure that at least some of these concerns are addressed, but I'd be
gravely concerned about a system where at the end of the day you're
relying on the hope that you have timed and calibrated everything to
better than the enemy's sensing noise floor.

@_author: "Riad S. Wahby" 
@_subject: Re: uniform pseudo random number generation 
It seems to me like the extent to which you can decorrelate the output
sequences is rather limited because of the requirement that each
sequence contain {0..360} precisely once, essentially because the
uniqueness requirement means that each sequence is, to a large majority,
characterized by the entropy at the beginning of the sequence, but not
at the end.
For example, let's say you have generated all but one digit of the
sequence.  Since there is only one unused number remaining, there is no
information encoded in the final digit of the sequence.  Similarly, the
second-last digit is one of only two possibilities, third-last is one of
three, et cetera.  So, at most, the second-last digit has one bit of
entropy, while the first has log2(361) =~ 8.5 bits.
If this doesn't trouble you, it should at least motivate you to attempt
to appropriately weight the digits in the sequence when you measure
correlation (correlation early in the sequence is "worse" than late,
since there's more information encoded in the early numbers).
So then, on to generating the sequence (and then back, briefly, to the
correlation question):
Let's assume you get entropy from an oracle,
(implicitly assuming here that, like in the SysV function, state gets
updated appropriately).  Also, assume the existence of a function
that removes the kth element from an array and returns a new array with
length reduced by 1, and
that appends elm to array and returns a new array with length increased
by 1.  Then:
(1) Initialize numarray = {0..360}.
(2) k = rand(state);
(3) nextInd = k mod length(numarray);
(4) nextNum = numarray[k];
(5) outarray = push(nextNum, outarray);
(5) numarray = delete(k, numarray);
(6) goto (2) while length(numarray) >= 0;
This should preserve as much entropy as possible in the generation of
your sequences.
Now, back to the correlation for a second: I claimed earlier that you
had to weight the digits by how much information they contain, but I
didn't talk about how you might do this.  If you generate the sequence
with the above method, I claim that you can easily accomplish this by
saving the sequence of k's that you generate, as long as you are careful
to store each k in a number of bits (approximately, in practice) equal
to log2(length(numarray)) for the corresponding step in the sequence. By
doing this, the early k's are guaranteed to take up more bits than the
late ones; thus correlating the sequence of k's stored in this way gives
a truer measure of the correlation of the sequences.

Getting it all set up on your end is not terribly difficult. In fact, in

was dispatched through procmail filtering on the Received header (the

the basic config as long as you don't break anything at the boundary.
The part we have to redesign is the way CDR nodes share their subscriber
lists / maintain a common whitelist. In the past this was done with
Majordomo "who", but I think it's a bad idea to enable this.
I propose instead that each node push its local subscription list to the
other nodes, possibly PGP signed to defend against the obvious attack
whereby massive amounts of garbage can be injected into the whitelist
with very little effort. (Yes, someone can still subscribe a massive
number of addresses to a node, but such activity has less leverage and
will draw attention.)
I'll put together the appropriate scripts tonight(ish), and once someone
else has a node set up we can do some testing and put the D back in CDR.

@_subject: Re: [cryptography] a Cypherpunks comeback 
Well played, sir. :)
By the way, the answer is in most cases no, sadly.
Most vanilla CMOS processes don't have high quality JFETs available. On
older nodes maybe you can get away with turning an N-well and a P+
diffusion into a JFET, but that doesn't work very well in more modern
processes because the N-wells have strongly retrograde doping, which
makes it hard to pinch off the "bottom" of the channel. Of course, even
at older nodes where it might be possible, the fabs don't bother
characterizing it for you. Sure, you can characterize it yourself, but
if the fab isn't supporting the device that implicitly means they're not
monitoring the quality of that device with their PCM structures, so good
luck with manufacturability long-term.
JFETs are pretty easy to make in high quality bipolar processes because
the base diffusion makes a decent JFET body. Doesn't add much/any cost
to have them in this case. Of course, if you have a BiCMOS process, then
you already have devices with high impedance gates, but for high
performance analog design a JFET beats the hell out of a MOSFET, since
the latter brings along with it a shitload of 1/f noise.
One place I've recently seen JFETs is in really high voltage processes.
Think like a mostly normal 0.18u CMOS process with a 600V (Vds) JFET
available. Haven't actually worked in such a beast, but you can imagine
that compared to MOSFETs, JFETs don't make such great power devices---

At a guess, I'd say a mix of laziness, inconsistent (client and server)
software support, and worries about additional CPU overhead.
Really high traffic sites are incentivized to use the least resource
intensive SSL algorithms they can, and generally speaking the forward
secrecy algorithms take more CPU time and more entropy for key exchange.
How many web servers these days are running on VMs like AWS where
entropy is a precious resource?
Apache 2.2 and earlier, without specific patches, didn't support forward
secrecy for a majority of browsers. I had to pull Apache 2.4 out of Sid
on the cpunks.org machine to get forward secrecy working with all modern
Speaking of browsers, there are still a huge number of really old
browsers out there that won't or can't (corporate policy, et cetera) be
updated any time in the near future. Turning off non-FS algos breaks SSL
for a *lot* of people.
Oh, and don't forget, OpenSSL 0.98(ish) and before didn't support the FS
algorithms. So the many servers where OpenSSL isn't getting upgraded any
time soon can't do it either.
Even if you do happen to have a conforming version of the appropriate
software server-side, you've still got to worry about actually setting
up the key order preferences appropriately. Few if any vendors are
shipping default configs that enable FS.
At least this last one is something we stand a chance of changing,
though: perhaps a start would be to submit bugs against the web server
packages from the usual suspects (debian et al) asking them to turn on
forward secrecy by default?

What you're talking about is a relatively high power design, which means
that in addition to worrying about designing the switching supply,
you're going to have to sweat the practical details regarding PCB
layout, et cetera.
I'd have a look at some of the reference designs and application notes
from the usual suspects (onsemi.com, ti.com, maxim-ic.com, linear.com),
since they will have a lot of good practical information on getting the

For more general information on theory and practice of dc/dc converter
design, "Fundamentals of Power Electronics 2e" by Erickson and
Maksimovic is my go-to reference. It more or less assumes you're already
an electrical engineer, which may or may not be useful to you. Along
these lines there's also "Principles of Power Electronics" by Kassakian
et al, a book dear to me but certainly not to all.

controller that I haven't actually built yet. It's not particularly well-
suited for kW converters, though, since the most basic form of the idea

reasonable amount of power you end up wanting to use an N-ch, as they're

that control electrons are generally higher performance than devices
that control holes).

@_subject: Re: bitcoin as a global medium of exchange 
Interesting to see this mentioned here. Mike Walfish and Andrew Blumberg
have written a nice survey on the work in this area:
    Justin Thaler provides another perspective:
    I can also add a little context to this conversation---I've actually
done an independent re-implementation of the work of Ben-Sasson et al
that Sean linked above.
At a high level, my take is that this area has huge potential, but
neither this work nor other projects in the area (summarized below) are
really practical---yet. The overhead for the party constructing the
proof is at least 3 orders of magnitude more than the cost of running
the computation directly. The work of Ben-Sasson et al costs more like 6
orders of magnitude! (In principle, though, they are paying this price
to achieve greater computational generality.)
The work required of the party verifying the computation is also non-trivial: while *checking* the answer is quick, these systems (with
one exception) require pre-processing work on the computation being
verified, and the cost of this is several orders of magnitude larger
than simply computing the result directly. (Note, however, that this
cost can be amortized by outsourcing the same computation over many
different inputs.)
But there is some real hope here: the rate at which progress is being
made is impressive (two years ago overhead was more like 20 orders of
magnitude than three!), and there are contexts where the extra work is
worth the cost. Perhaps one of these is a cryptocurrency that relies on
proof of "useful" work.
With regard to smooth difficulty adjustment: since the goal of most of
these projects is to encode arbitrary computations, the problems of
difficulty adjustment and proof of work become orthogonal.
For those wanting a bit more detail:
Broadly speaking, there are four research groups working on this stuff:
  - Ben-Sasson et al at Technion/Tel Aviv/MIT
          - Parno et al at Microsoft Research
          - Thaler et al at Harvard
          - Walfish et al at UT Austin/NYU (full disclosure: I work with these guys)
        The work of Thaler et al is somehat distinct from the other three
because, while it is extremely efficient for certain computations,
it is not general: the efficiency improvements it offers are limited
to computations with a regular underlying structure. However, when
this requirement is met, it has very low overhead compared to the
other three systems, and it involves no costly pre-processing.
The three other groups have built systems that compile from a subset of C to a form whose result can be encoded into a probabilistically
checkable proof. The resulting PCP is huge, so in all three systems the
result is not the proof itself. Rather, the proof is queried and the
result used for verification. The method of querying is one
distinguishing factor between these systems.
Ben-Sasson et al and Parno et al share common ancestry in the work of
Gennaro et al, also at Microsoft Research.
    In both cases, the query/response take the form of a noninteractive
argument. Basically, the queries are encrypted and bundled into the
description of the computation ahead of time, after which the
computation can be run by providing an input and requesting an answer.
These systems also support public verifiability, allowing the answer to
be checked by anyone holding the public verification key.
The work of Ben-Sasson et al achieves more generality by encoding
computations as the execution of a virtual microprocessor, then
verifying correct execution of the processor. This system supports full C semantics and achieves an efficient abstraction for verified RAM
(again, at a penalty of 3 *additional* orders of magnitude beyond the
other systems).
The UT/NYU group have also adapted a simplification of Gennaro et al,
but their system really rests upon refinements of the efficient argument
systems of Ishai et al.
    In this case, verification involves two separate interactions, one that
establishes a commitment to the proof and one that queries it. Though it
requires interaction, the advantage of this approach is that it is
cryptographically simpler. Concretely, the crypto is one of the most
expensive parts of the system, so this simplification results in good
performance relative to the other systems.
The UT/NYU group have also developed verifiable storage abstractions,

Lest anyone misinterpret the quotes, I assure you I do nothing of the

I've been subscribed to cpunks in one form or other since the early 90s,
and thinking back to those days makes the worries about SNR on the list

that any of the distributed remailer nodes even had sender whitelisting;
even with the worst flaming the SNR now is an order of magnitude better
than what we'd get prior to Ericm's LNE.com node.

@_subject: Re: CDRv2 discussion (was: Re: Al-qaeda.net deprecated) 
I'm not sure if you mean on the backend (between nodes) or on the
frontend (local delivery to node subscribers).
In the former case, I agree: it makes sense to just have a blanket
policy that peered nodes are expected to forward everything they receive
at their ingress address (allowing other nodes to apply their own local
filtering policies).
If you mean the latter, I disagree that zero filtering is a good
approach to running a node (but the whole point is that we can make both
available and let the users choose). In practice, I'm quite certain that
readership on the present cypherpunks envisagement would drop
precipitously if I turned off sender whitelisting. There's a difference
between "I can do this" and "I will do this because it is worth my
time." The fact is, once the cost of being a subscriber exceeds its
utility, a rational person will unsubscribe; a node with sender
whitelisting (with explicit whitelisting for anonymous remailers)
achieves a balance that, empirically, is worthwhile for most people:
recall the rush to LNE.com when Eric introduced this. More to the point,
the willingness of a person to sink time into wading through list
detritus is no indication of his or her value as a contributor.
Fundamentally, subscriber lists are a good metric by which to judge
whether a particular message should or should not be delivered; it is
therefore useful to build the notion of cross-node sender whitelisting
into CDRv2 in a way that cannot be trivially abused. Of course, all
sender whitelisting leaks *some* information about subscribers; the goal
is just to do no worse than a monolithic list.
No doubt about it; I'm certainly not volunteering to do any such thing!

@_subject: Re: CDRv2 discussion (was: Re: Al-qaeda.net deprecated) 
In CDRv1, all nodes would in principle forward all messages to other
nodes, only filtering the feed going to that node's own users according
to the local filtering policy.
It makes sense to ask nodes to publish details of their local policies.
I think personally I would hesitate to peer with any node that didn't
forward everything and let me apply my own filter. I assume most other
operators would as well, so practically speaking no one would run a node
that didn't (claim to) forward everything.
Next question: how paranoid are we, i.e., do we attempt to enforce this
policy somehow? This goes beyond fault tolerance towards attempting to
solve the problem of enforcing peering contracts with untrusted CDRv2
nodes, which is clearly a more... intersting one.
I have been busy with real life, and haven't dedicated much more time to
thinking about this. I'm hopeful that tomorrow I will have the

@_subject: Re: CDRv2 discussion (was: Re: Al-qaeda.net deprecated) 
As far as I can tell this doesn't (yet) solve the problem of
whitelisting subscribers to other nodes.
However, we can add one more step and solve this: when a node receives
an email from the repeater whose sender is a member of the node's local
subscriber list, it bounces the message back to the repeater with an
added header saying, in effect, "I vouch for this sender."
Other nodes employing sender whitelisting would ignore the first email,
since its sender isn't locally whitelisted and it lacks the
aforementioned node-auth header, but would presumably forward the second
email, assuming they chose to trust the node that is vouching for the
sender. Nodes with no whitelisting policy could safely ignore the second
email by filtering out duplicate msgids or something similar.
I'm not totally in love with the master repeater scheme, though.
Notwithstanding my previous comments regarding the supposed threat model
behind the CDR's original conception, as long as we're paying the fixed
cost of setting up a new system we may as well get *some* additional
reliability out of it, right?

@_subject: CDRv2 discussion (was: Re: Al-qaeda.net deprecated) 
It was around 2005 that the last few nodes dropped off the old CDR, so
it's been quite a while since we've been distributed.
I went back through the list archives late last year in search of the
history of the CDR. While I'm sure others can add more to the skeleton,
what I found went into the Cypherpunk Wikipedia entry (with references
to archived emails where possible).
To be honest, I'm not sure distribution is a response to any real
threat: to the extent that the Cpunks list is of interest, isn't it more
sensible to keep it alive and monitored than to shut it down? Of course,
as J.A. points out, there are plenty of other reasons, viz., different
list policies at different nodes (reply-to:, subject modification,
sender whitelisting, etc.)---and these create some problems that we'll
have to address in designing CDRv2.
So let's talk a bit about the CDR architecture.
One obvious issue with the old one is that it was a bit rickety: at its
heart it was a bandaid fractal built on top of procmail and Majordomo,
and getting it set up took enough work that most people didn't want to
do it. To this end, I suggest we build upon mailman this time around:
the codebase is reasonably well maintained, plenty of people feel
comfortable hacking in Python, and we automatically get more user
friendliness in the subscriber and administrative interfaces.
(In principle, an even better way to do this would be to cleanly
separate the CDR functionality from the list management functionality so
that individual nodes can decide on their own what list software to run.
This probably ends up expanding the time cost of the project well in
excess of the utility it generates, so my vote would be against making
this a requirement.)
One major question we need to address is the topology of the CDR network
itself. From an implementation point of view it would be most
straightforward if every node knew about every other node, but one could
argue that this is too fragile. If we take that position, we have to
solve a broadcast repeater problem: when a node receives a message, it
needs to have some way of deciding what other nodes it forwards messages
to. Obviously we'd like to do this in a way that doesn't result in a lot
of useless echoes. (Recognizing that perfect is the enemy of good may be
the better part of valor here; after all, we don't expect to have more
than a handful of CDR nodes.)
As before, we want to be able to have independent policies at each node
at least with respect to:
    - subject line modification
    - header mangling (reply-to: etc)
    - attachments
    - sender whitelisting
    - other things I'm forgetting
As far as I can tell, the ones that will require the most work are
subject line modification and sender whitelisting.
Mangling the subject line becomes a problem because eventually we end up
with subjects like "[CDR] Re: [Cpunks] Re: [Cypherpunks] foo", which
confuses a lot of mail clients. This isn't a problem for monolithic
mailman setups because mailman knows not to add another prefix to
outgoing messages that already have one, but the problem becomes more
difficult when each node potentially has its own (possibly empty)
prefix. This problem would have a trivial solution in the case that all
nodes knew the tagging policy at all other nodes, but (as I point out
above) we may prefer not to require nodes to know all other nodes in the
CDR. (The fallback solution is the old one: manually construct an
appropriate filter to demangle subject lines. Yech.)
In the old CDR (possibly after the LNE.com modifications circa 2001),
nodes had to expose their sender lists (at least to other nodes) to
allow for member whitelisting. Obviously this is ripe for abuse, and I'd
prefer to achieve this in a different way if possible. The goal here is
to make it easy to verify that a given sender is subscribed to *some*
node but difficult to enumerate all list subscribers. I can see how one
might think of this as coddling the supposedly savvy and internet-
hardened subscribers of the list, but I just don't see any reason to
expose users to more abuse than necessary, especially when solutions to
this problem have already been described and are nominally right in the
cpunks wheelhouse!
I have a skeleton architecture in mind that can be beaten into a shape
capable of addressing the above issues, but as this email is getting
long and I've doubtless forgotten several other important problems,
let's discuss a bit more first.

@_subject: cypherpunks administrivia: no more reply-to header stripping 
Until now, mailman has been stripping Reply-To: headers from messages
to the list. I've just turned this off.
Some webmail services (notably, Yahoo!) set the Reply-To: header and
include it in the headers signed with DKIM. Stripping Reply-To: thus
breaks the DKIM signature. In the case of Yahoo! this signature
breakage is especially problematic, because their DMARC policy is set
to reject. (In other words, messages with yahoo.com in the From:
header that fail both SPF and DKIM should be rejected by compliant
mail services, e.g., AOL, Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo!)
Messages to the mailing list should pass SPF, since the envelope
sender domain for list messages is cpunks.org and I publish an
appropriate spf RR. However, any list subscriber who forwards mail to
another account will have broken SPF and an invalid DKIM signature,
which trips the DMARC policy and causes delivery failures.
I realize that this might cause some inconvenience, but I would prefer
to err on the side of successfully delivering messages whenever
possible. If you're using procmail and prefer the old behavior, the
following recipe should suffice:
* ^list-id.*cypherpunks.cpunks.org

@_subject: Re: Open Fabs 
Ah, I see. I thought the focus was on cold boot or evil maid attacks
against FPGA-based (thus, nominally trustworthy) CPUs, and how these
attacks might compare to similar attacks against a commercial CPU.
As you pointed out before, one may as well just grab the configuration
out of the ROM itself, and I agree---but my point was that either way,
what are we getting except some information that's not really secret?
So I think we're in violent agreement, at least to the extent that
we're talking about the same thing :)
Also: one assumes that cold boot attacks against the contents of
RAM are more useful than against the SRAMs that hold the FPGA's
configuration, and in that case probably it's little different from
the equivalent attack against a commercial CPU (the DRAM is more
or less the same whether we're talking about the commercial or the
FPGA-based CPU---you're using the same DIMMs either way).
On further reflection, I suppose the contents of the block RAMs inside
the FPGA (little SRAMs sprinkled through the fabric) might be a prize
worth chasing, since those are presumably acting as registers and
cache for our CPU. It *might* be possible to do so by cold booting the
FPGA with a configuration that dumps the contents of the block RAMs,
assuming that those contents aren't cleared by power-on reset or the
configuration process itself.
To your point above about auditing the configuration actually running
on an FPGA: that would be very interesting to prevent against an FPGA
manufacturer going the reflections-on-trusting-trust route.
Here's one way an evil FPGA manufacturer might proceed: the CAD
software that the manufacturer provides with the FPGA detects that
you're synthesizing a CPU. Rather than emit a flawed bitstream
(which might be detectable just by examining the bitstream itself),
perhaps the software would hide in the bitstream some instructions
that direct the FPGA's configuration state machine to introduce flaws
at config time.
(FPGA config bitstreams are big, complicated, and proprietary; so
it's not impossible that they contain enough redundancy that one
could use stego to hide such commands in the bitstream.)
(This approach also helps to get around the fact that the synthesis
and fitting process does a randomized search for a configuration
that meets your criteria (e.g., speed, size, etc.). In other words:
the best time to detect "this guy is trying to build a CPU" is when
the software is reading your Verilog, not when it's loading the
bitstream into an FPGA, because it's really really hard to decide
"this is a CPU" just by examining the bitstream itself.)
But I suppose if I were so devious as a manufacturer of FPGAs as to
detect a CPU design and introduce subtle bugs as a result, I would
probably also do my best to keep you from detecting it, even if you
*are* able to read out the config from a running FPGA. It's quite a
large haystack for hiding such a little needle...
(And regarding cold booting to read out the config SRAMs: I worry even
more here than in the case of block RAMs that these have a carefully
designed power-on reset scheme in place so that the FPGA fabric comes
up in a known state.)

@_author: "Riad S. Wahby" 
@_subject: Re: Open Fabs 
But that just gives away the bitstream describing the FPGA
configuration (say, a trusted CPU). Is the CPU's *design* a secret? If
not, I don't see why it matters that an evil cleaner might read out the
FPGA's configuration. (Obviously, don't store secret keys in there!)
If we really are worried about keeping the CPU's design a secret, it's
possible with many FPGAs to encrypt the configuration bitstream such
that the configuration is decrypted onboard the FPGA at power-on. This
is intended to handle the case where I want to sell a product that uses
an FPGA without revealing the contents of that FPGA's configuration to
my customers or competitors.
Of course, this doesn't really provide useful security guarantees
against a sophisticated adversary. First, since the FPGA contains or
automatically derives the secret key to decrypt this encrypted bitstream,
the manufacturer of the FPGA likely also knows the key or how to derive
it (as does anyone with sufficient dedication and a well-equipped lab).
Second, we have no idea how well this system is designed or implemented,
since the bitstream security system is itself a proprietary secret. And
third, even if it's competently built, as I pointed out above, the threat
model is "customer reads out my proprietary design," which means that,
practically speaking, the technological barrier is only there to support
a more comprehensive framework of legal recourse in the case that my
customer or competitor tries to steal the secret sauce.
Probably a reasonable evil cleaner attack against an FPGA-based
"trusted" CPU is to overwrite the contents of the configuration
ROM with a similar but subtly bugged design. This is more or less
isomorphic to "the NSA signs bugged microcode for my Intel CPU."
Cue the OTP / epoxy / physical security arms race, I guess.

This is how cpunks was run from 1997 until mid-2005, when this

It's a nice idea in theory, but (with all respect) the original
implementation was far from pretty; kudos to Jim Choate and Igor
Chudov for making it work at all :)
In principle it should be pretty straightforward to make a "distributed
mailman" setup work.  The high-level idea is that all the servers
accept messages, and all messages get forwarded to all servers. Then
each server decides based on local policy which messages get delivered
to users. For example, someone might decide they want to run a cpunks
node that's moderated, and the important thing is that only their
subscribers would see the moderated version of the list---subscribers
to another node could get the full feed.
The server-server forwarding stuff is like 10 lines of procmail, and
requires no changes to mailman. The part that gets slightly hairy is
implementing subscriber-only filtering [1]. In a naive setup, every
node needs to know every other node's subscriber list. In addition
to the (completely surmountable but sometimes annoying) issues with
distributed synchronization, this is potentially a privacy concern
for list subscribers.
One step toward fixing this would be for lists to blind their
whitelists. For example, a list could publish a set of SHA256 hashes
of suscriber addresses, or maybe even something more clever, e.g.,
    But this still isn't perfect. For example, when a subscriber sends an
email, each server gets to see which whitelist the subscriber matched
against, which means that servers can keep track over time and build
up a mapping from active posters to home nodes. This might not be
a problem, but it's worth considering whether there's some approach
that would fix this without too much computational overhead.
[1] I understand that there are reasons to have a fully unregulated
    list, but in my view subscriber-only filtering plus whitelisting
    known remailers gives a good balance between ease of posting
    and good SNR. If I recall correctly, the LNE.com CDR node was
    the first to implement this policy, and I followed Eric's lead
    because it was far and away better than what came before it.

Yes. Really, procmail is all you need. If the local node is
mynodename.com, then make the posting address (cypherpunks go to
the procmailrc below and an internal address (_cypherpunks go to
the local mailman instance. So your /etc/aliases might have lines like:
    cypherpunks: |procmail -m /etc/procmailrcs/procmailrc_cpunks
    _cypherpunks: |mailman post cypherpunks
Note that you will have to tell mailman to accept messages addressed
to cypherpunks and cypherpunks in addition
to cypherpunks
As I said in my previous message, the harder part is sender whitelisting.

This is a nice thought, but it has two pretty major issues.
First, one of the reasons to have many nodes is so that nodes can apply
their own filtering policies to the traffic. But naively operating
the setup you describe would apply that filtering policy to mail
going from that node to other nodes, which is bad---the "backbone"
traffic should be unfiltered. It's possible to get around this issue,
but (e.g.) vanilla mailman can't do it.
Second, in the setup you describe, posting to the list instantly
reveals to everyone which node you're subscribed to, which is
information I was trying to keep hidden in the design I proposed.
If it's OK to reveal to other node operators which list a poster is
subscribed to, a simple solution is having the nodes share blinded
(e.g., hashed and salted) subscriber lists with one another (note
that this hides subscription information from everyone other than
node operators).
In my estimation, this is not a good idea. The reason is that adding
nodes to the network takes work from existing node owners. If the
incentive structure is such that it's almost no work to set up a new
node, then people will be incentivized to start nodes ("hey, that
sounds fun"), but not to keep them running ("ugh, too much work").
This will result in a bunch of node churn, which is bad.
Plus, what sane person would run a Docker image put together by a
bunch of strangers from Cypherpunks?
Finally, lowering the bar for people to run nodes sounds like a good
idea until you're subscribed to a node whose operator is ignorant or
malicious. Node operators are in a semi-trusted position. Having a
barrier to entry is probably a good thing.

I'm guessing the big change since we moved the list is TLS.
SPF is already in place.
There's a DKIM pubkey with the selector "email" to which Greg's server
(presumably) has the secret. But it is somewhat unusual, as far as
I know, for listservs to add their own DKIM signatures when passing
mail through; certainly mine never did. Usually the idea is that you
check the sender's DKIM, and the listserv should just avoid munging
headers so that the signatures can still be checked by the recipient.
I'd be surprised if DMARC changes much since I never had it set up
either, but of course I could be wrong.

Specifically: all mail to  or  should
now go to Greg's list instance. In the next few days, Greg and I

@_subject: Re: Fwd: [Cryptography] "Flip Feng Shui: Hammering a Needle in the Software Stack" 
The answer is "it depends."
Machines with ECC RAM make successful rowhammer attacks considerably
harder, and meanwhile most cloud providers use ECC (e.g., Amazon uses
ECC on all machines according to their FAQ). In fact, the Flip Feng
Shui paper obliquely acknowledges that ECC helps to prevent the attack,
but doesn't quantify beyond "we have observed that Rowhammer can
occasionally induce multiple flips in a single 64-bit word" (\S 6.1.1).
For a better idea of how much harder it makes things, let's have a
look at another paper from USENIX Security this year,
    There's a bit of decoding to do here: all of the evaluation in
this paper uses machines that *don't* have ECC. Fortunately, we can
extrapolate from figure 13(c). Remember that with ECC, one needs to
flip 3 bits in a word to undetectably change the state of RAM: ECC
will silently fix 1-bit errors and produce a machine check exception
on a 2-bit error. How much harder is it to flip 1 bit than to flip
3? According to Fig. 13(c), it's ~30x harder to flip 2 bits than 1,
and another ~30x harder to flip 3 bits than 2.
As an aside: note that the attack the Xiao paper describes only works
against Xen guests that *don't* use hardware-assisted page tables
(EPT for Intel, NPT for AMD). If you're using hardware-assisted
virtualization (e.g., most Amazon "HVM" instances), this particular
attack won't work; others might, of course.
So if you're paranoid about rowhammer in a cloud setting, one strategy
is to monitor the MCE log and shut down any instance that's getting
a lot of uncorrectable ECC errors, as this may indicate an active
rowhammer attack. But my guess is that if someone is trying to pwn
you with a cross-VM attack, they're going to use something like
cache timing: it's harder to detect and probably easier to pull off,
assuming your cloud box has ECC RAM.
But as always, new discoveries might change the whole game.

@_subject: Re: 4096 bit SSL keys 
Multiplying two n-bit numbers naively costs O(n^2) operations (one
can do better with Karatsuba and related tricks), and exponentiation
costs O(n) multiplications (so O(n^3) in total). So assuming the device
is using something like Montgomery multiplication you'd expect about
8x increased load. 30x sounds like there *could* be some other issue
with the implementation, but a significant slowdown is not unexpected.
Depends who you ask.
    - NSA Suite B recommends at least 3072 bits.
- BSI says 2048 bits for now, but 3072 bits for 2017 and beyond.
- ANSSI and NIST both say 2048 bits should be fine through 2030.
All of the above recommendations seem to assume the adversary is
classical rather than quantum.
Shor's algorithm runs in time O(n^2) and requires O(n) qubits to
factor an n-bit number. The first doesn't offer much help: you're
only increasing the time by 4x going from 2048 to 4096 bits. I'm not
qualified to comment on how much the second helps because it's not
at all clear to me how the expense/difficulty of building a quantum
computer scales with the number of qubits.
But if you're worried about defending against general-purpose quantum
computers, there are other weak points you should be shoring up (no pun
intended): 256-bit symmetric ciphers, preferably with 256-bit blocks
(so Rijndael-256 rather than AES-256); and ephemeral key exchanges
that don't rely on Diffie-Hellman (Google is deploying RLWE and LWE
schemes in the next coupld years; supersingular isogeny D-H also
looks promising, but there's a recent attack that suggests caution).
In sum: it's a strange and scary new world once general-purpose quantum
computers arrive. In the next few years we're going to see the rollout
of new post-quantum ciphersuites. For now, maybe we should learn to
stop worrying and love the qubit :)
