In both cases, the evildoers may only gain access to a
passphrase-protected private key.  That doesn't help if the private
key is generated on a compromised system, but it helps if the system
is compromised after the private keys are generated, or if the private
key is generated elsewhere and loaded onto the compromised system.
And it doesn't help if the passphrase is easily guessed.
