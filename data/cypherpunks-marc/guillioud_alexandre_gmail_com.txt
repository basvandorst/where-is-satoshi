What I need, is a cut circuit of all gps/gsm/3g/4g/bluetooth/wifi/whatever
which emit/receive radio radiations. Today, it's something uncommon on the
mobile market.. You can't totally controle hardware throught software
easily. If i don't want wifi or gsm, i need to be able to disable totally
these chips. Not standby them..
My iphone contain so much offline music, offline games app and
notes/documents that i want to be able to use totally offline. Popping out
the battery doesn't achieve this.
