if your phone is stolen and used by a drug dealer, i'm pretty sure the cops
would not be after you for anything the dealer did.
if you stand on the corner with a sign saying "free cell phone airtime,
just ask me", they might take a different view on things.
now, whether you are guilty of anything or not, by standing there with a sign
you are certainly opening yourself to legal inquiry, delay and hassle.
i wouldn't be surprised if the cops didn't accept your "i'm just letting
people use my phone, i've got nothing to do with their activities" defence,
at least not without poking about for a bit, which might include looking
at your cellphone, your home phone, your bank records, and anything else
they think (and a judge agrees) might need viewing to clear you.
