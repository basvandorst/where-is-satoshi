I just made the brain melting mistake of trying to read the DMCA.  The text
which jumps out at me is:
   `(2) EXCEPTION- Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to material
      residing at the direction of a subscriber of the service provider on a
      system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider
      that is removed, or to which access is disabled by the service provider,
      pursuant to a notice provided under subsection (c)(1)(C), unless the
      service provider--
   `(A) takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it
         has removed or disabled access to the material;
   `(B) upon receipt of a counter notification described in paragraph (3),
         promptly provides the person who provided the notification
under subsection
         (c)(1)(C) with a copy of the counter notification, and
informs that person
         that it will replace the removed material or cease disabling
access to it
         in 10 business days; and
   `(C) replaces the removed material and ceases disabling access to it not
         less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the
         counter notice, unless its designated agent first receives
notice from the
         person who submitted the notification under subsection
(c)(1)(C) that such
         person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain
the subscriber
         from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the
         service provider's system or network.
I'm about 90% sure that in a fair court, it would be concluded that
disabling the reported URL qualifies as disabling access to the material.
The court might then issue an injunction to, in the future, disable *all*
*possible* access to the material, but that's not the current text of the
law.  YMMV

I seriously doubt many TOR exit nodes have the political clout to be
considered a common carrier.
In a related note, I wonder if the six-strike rule would violate the ISP's
safe harbor, as it's clearly content inspection.
