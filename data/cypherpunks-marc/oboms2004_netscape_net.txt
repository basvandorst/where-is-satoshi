@_subject: CAN YOU BE TRUSTED? 
I am the head and director of a Private Bank in Netherlands and I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.This involves a client who has a large deposit of about $35,000,000 usd (thirty five million usd) in our bank with investment intentions many years ago, the circumstances surrounding the investment made by this client who died interstate,  has made it very difficult to locate anyone who is directly related to the deceased.
With the very strong feeling that no one will ever come forward to claim the funds and the investigation has been closed after several months,the need for an assistance becomes crucial, as a next of kin to the depositor is earnestly being searched for but no has come forward, I have already developed a foolproof, legal and totally risk free means through which the fund can be released to your nominated bank account within a very short time after due documentation and authentication process.The strategy is to use my position and influence as the Head of the branch and Personal Account office of the deceased to present you as a next of Kin and beneficiary of the deposit. I want to assure you that I have concluded all local modalities for the successful completion of this within 10 banking days of your agreement to proceed with me as the required assistance is perfected to be 100% risk free.All you need to do is to open an online account with our bank and i will transfer this $35,000,000 usd into the account to be opened by you and thereafter you have to transfer the money to your private account in your country and i will then have to close the account here in my bank and destroy all the documents and come over to your country for my share. Incase this proposal is accepted by you, Myself and my co managers will take 70% while you take 25% and 5%!
 should be set aside for any exp
ences Incured by both side.
I expect your urgent response and if in the affirmative, I shall advice you on what we need to do.
Best regards,
 ALEX VAN DIJK
