agreed. my point is really that the fingerprint/ID hash algo shouldn't be carved in stone. like most other parts of the openPGP spec, it should be flexible and user defined (within certain constraints). as time goes by, strong algorithms are proven to be not as strong as originally thought. this has happened to MD5, is now happening to SHA-1, and will just as likely happen to the next generation of hash algorithms. the spec needs to adapt to this landscape, not be re-written every time a hash is broken.
the spec has it right where the digest and cipher algorithms are concerned, and that needs to be adapted to fingerprints and key IDs.

there's more to it than that. openPGP specifies SHA-1 (and nothing else) as the hash used to generate key fingerprints, and is what key IDs are derived from.
a real threat if this can be extended into a practical attack is substituting a key with a *different* key having the same ID and fingerprint. it would be difficult for average users (and impossible for the current openPGP infrastructure) to tell bob's key from mallory's key that claims to be bob's.
it can also be used (if the attack becomes practical) to forge key signatures. mallory can create a bogus key and "sign" it with anyone's real key. this would turn the web of trust into dust.
the openPGP spec seemed to have assumed that SHA-1 just wouldn't fail. ever. this was the same mistake made in the original version of pgp that relied on md5. the spec needs to allow a choice of hash algorithms for fingerprints and key IDs, or else we'll play this game every time someone breaks a strong hash algorithm.

regardless of the size of the message... if it's being signed/verified then you're signing/verifying a hash. if it's being de/encrypted you're de/encrypting a session key.
for all practical purposes the overhead of using larger keys and hashes doesn't get worse with larger messages.

if you're paranoid about RSA, then there's no reason to go to ECC since the math behind it is still young and uncertain. while a 1024 bit RSA key ~may~ not be secure for a long time, it's old age is due only to computing horsepower, not a "break" in the math behind it. as such, a larger RSA key buys time... and only time will tell if it buys "enough" time for a particular need.
gpg does support RSA-2048/SHA-256 (or even RSA-4096/SHA-512) which is what i've been using for a while now. i'll sign this email with RSA-2048/SHA-256 (my default on this key) just to show what it looks like. it's a big signature block, but not ridiculous and on a reasonably powerful computer it's hardly a noticeable delay to work with such keys.

and the prosecution provides another mirrored copy of the original drive. that trick will get old, really fast.
