keys look
Out of curiosity, was there any indication that Bernstein's
improvements might apply to the discrete log problem, DSA in general,
and the 1024-bit limit on key size built into NIST's DSS standard?
Revoking an RSA key and re-issuing a longer one might be a pain, but
there's no option for that in the current GPG implementation.
