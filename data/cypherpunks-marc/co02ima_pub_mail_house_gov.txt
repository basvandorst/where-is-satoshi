Dear Constituent,
Thank you for contacting me. Listening and responding to the concerns of the
constituents in the Second Congressional District (2nd CD) is very important
to me. I have chosen to use the Write Your Representative website
( for e-mail communication.  This service
will help me communicate better with people of the 2nd CD and allow
constituents to contact me without using an e-mail provider.  As a result, I
do not have a public e-mail address.  Please use the Write Your Rep service
in the future, so I can better serve you by corresponding more efficiently,
promptly and completely.
Once again, thanks for writing me with your concerns.
Warm Regards,
Mark E. Udall
Member of Congress
