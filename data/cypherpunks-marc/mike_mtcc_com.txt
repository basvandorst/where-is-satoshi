I think that the larger issue here is resilience. If you're completely
dependent on IP, then when IP fails you're hosed. We have a situation
where that is becoming more and more true, however. When the last
vestiges of TDM are rooted out of the telephony network, we will be
less resilient than before. When paper record trails are replaced by
the cloud, we are less resilient. It's sort of scarey in some ways how
much of an information monoculture we're building: it's a huge strength
and a glaring vulnerability.

Sure, but balance that with podunk.usa's possibly incompetent IT staff? It costs
a lot of money to run a state of the art shop, but only incrementally more as
you add more and more instances of essentially identical shops. I guess I have
more trust that Google is going to get the redundancy, etc right than your average
IT operation.
Now whether you should *trust* Google with all of that information from a
security standpoint is another kettle of fish.

In fact, it's very useful -- what do you think the initial diffie-hellman
exchanges are doing with pfs? Encryption without (strong) authentication
is still useful for dealing with passive listening. It's a shame, for example,
that wifi security doesn't encrypt everything on an open AP to require
attacks be active rather than passive. It's really easy to just scan the
airwaves, but I probably don't need to remind you of that.

I'd say we already have those things too in the form of PGP/SMIME.
Who knows what the NSA can break, but it's just not right to say that
we need new protocols. The means has been there for many years to
secure email (fsvo 'secure'), it's just that it's not terribly convenient
so we just don't for the most part.

Uh, a first step might be to just turn on [START]TLS. We're not using the
tools that have been implemented and deployed for a decade at least.

My bet is that when the said the were "partially" capable of intercepting things,
that means that they haven't broken any of the usual suspects in a way, but instead are using anything they can think of to do what they want to
do. So all of the known crypto vulnerabilities, backdoors, breakins, etc, etc are
added to the "partial" bucket. And it wouldn't surprise me that that "partial" is
an impressive amount, because so much of internet security is a big old
