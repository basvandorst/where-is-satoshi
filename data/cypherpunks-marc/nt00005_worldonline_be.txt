The TISR Model has now been fully illustrated and TISR offers a complete, broad, holistic and consistent basis for understanding our societal world -- a basis that may now be refined in the future issues both in practical and theoretical terms. In addition, the news of The Social Capital Foundation are good. The first international conference of TSCF, held May 12-13 2004 in Brussels, has been a success.

Please let us know if you would be interested. Best wishes, The International Scope Review - The Social Capital Foundation
