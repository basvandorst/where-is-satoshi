Perhaps Ms. Caproni needs to read the 11th Amendment. "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,...
...commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."
Where are your Courts of Law, Ms. Caproni? You are committing a fraud upon the American people, a fraud via public speech, using intimidation from a public, corporate, office.

Seconded. Post instructions on a setup and it will be running on a debian
vserver guest.
An additional mixmaster/tor middleman node is planned as well.

Traceability has to exist because there is no money in circulation.
Seen this?:
Basically everywhere that your attorney would never look ;).
The GSF documents are a start. There is more in the pipeline. You need to learn
Common Law, how to do a Claim of Right, etc.
FYI, such a /Claim of Right/ is far advanced.
Lessons on Common Law:  - how it works is basically how a real
Court of Record works:
At a minimum read every essay here:
At a minimum listen to this:
Then go back and read all the GSF documents and claim of right:
This for bonus points (latest developments):
Basic quiz after all that:
1. What is the difference between money and currency?
2. What is the difference between one of the People of America and a US Citizen?
3. Is the President (the current one, and, say, the last dozen) of the United
States an American?
4. What is a Court of Record?
5. What kind of court is a US Federal or State Court or UK equivalent?
6. What is on deposit at a US or UK retail bank?
7. Who /can claim/ to *represent* the people?
8. Define the territory of the United States.
9. What *is* the United States and/or the United Kingdom?
10. What is the /law of the land/ and who can claim to enforce it?
The GSF System allows for multiple, independent issuers. The idea is, to start
an economy, not a monopoly. See claim of right.
p.s. Feel free to forward a copy to anyone you *know* (do not spam), including
but not limited to: Judge Advocate General of US Navy, US Coast Guard, US
Supreme Court Justices, World Court, the President of the United States, Prime
Minister of UK, US & UK Army Provost Marshal, FBI, CIA, MI5, MI6, House of
Commons, US Congress, House of Lords, US Senate, US Fed Res, BoE, SEC, FSA,
Interpol and similar in other countries. Any such high powered recipient can
then forward his or her response to the quiz to us or one of the lists.
Responses will be published, gag orders *notwithstanding*. If you wish to write,

Hello David,
"Today, we do not have money or stock markets. We have debt tokens, slave
identification cards, money markets instead of stock markets, and fascists in
charge. In a related note, we do not have news, we have propaganda. This is
because we do not have a market for news, we have a market for advertising. News
merely turns into filler in-between the paid advertising spots. Naturally
parasites arise to replace news with propaganda."
So, hell no, religious idealism won't cut it. You need a market.

Oh, lets get you started. Go on, you already have:
I see.
My question, Steve, is how does "1 dollar" come into existence?
Lets make that three questions. How does 1 dollar in your bank account get there
and how does a 1 dollar Federal Reserve Note come into existence. Are they one
and the same?
Anything else you wish to add regarding a gold standard, I'm all ears.
