You have selective amnesia . I said I want people who drive smog-belching one or two ton potential homicide machines to have a certification in homicide avoidance. It's called a "Drivers License" and albeit it doesn't preclude homicide on the part of the certified it helps provide justification-for-the-crushed that the person who did it knew how not to do so.
"Through counter-intelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential trouble-makers ... And neutralize them, neutralize them, neutralize them"

This is all child's-play. A couple of years ago a company called Persistent Systems was discovered to have been doing full-time 24/7/365 Wide Area Surveillance of ALL OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY for the LASD. They changed their name to Dojo Technlogy to avoid the publicity.
Locally they were noted by yours truly as the company that does the surveillance system for the local transit station (bus). They're probably also responsible for sat-tracking the buses which has been ongoing for literally decades.
Again, full-time 24/7/365 Wide Area Surveillance of ALL OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY at a price the LASD could afford. Why waste money on aviation fuel?
