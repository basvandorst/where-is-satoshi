@_subject: Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. 
That to secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed.
That whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the
People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying its foundation on such principles
and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and
Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and
transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design
to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government,
and to provide new Guards for their future security. Thomas Jefferson
We the people of this country we can do this if all
our freedoms are taken away by the government. We are
allowed to ask for reform if our country goes bad.
How much longer will we let the government pick off
our right?
If we let it continue our country will become just
like england right now!

   "Just a few weeks ago I had a piece in the Bangor
paper. It's on our
   website, greenparty.org... I submitted it under my
name alone. It's    fairly radical piece; that's what I do. I'm a
political and
   environmental activist.
   "I walked into the Bangor airport. What I saw was
National Guard    all over carrying machine guns... The atmosphere
was very tense...
   This was Thursday... I went over to the American
Airlines ticket
   counter way down at the end. Nobody else was there,
except the    I gave him my name. He didn't even ask for photo
ID. It was almost
   like they were expecting me. He put it into the
computer. He stayed    the computer a long time, like 10 minutes.
   "He put an S on the boarding pass, for search. He
said, 'You've been
   picked for having your bag searched.' ... I said to
him, 'This    random, was it?' He said, 'No you were in there to
be searched, no
   matter what.' I went over to baggage to put my bags
through the    and then went into the boarding area.
   "There was this National Guard guy there. He yells
over at me, so
   everyone can hear, 'Bring your bags over here.' You
know how they    when they're all puffed up with themselves. He
said, 'Hurry up,' so    slowed down some more.
   "I put my bags on the table. The two women
employees were standing
   there. [I tried to help them with a stuck zipper.]
He grabbed my    arm, he started yelling in my face, 'Don't you know
what happened?
   Sep. 11, don't you know thousands of people died?'
I said, 'You    do that.' He went to grab my arm, and I said,
'Don't touch me.' I    an older airline guy shake his head, 'No,' and he
backed off.
   "That insulted his little manhood. He could not
force me to listen    his idiot ideas on Sep. 11, whatever it was he
wanted to say. So he
   was angry. I hadn't done anything except pull away
from him... I    he was trying to provoke me. They did the wand
thing, they were    and I heard him say real soft, 'Don't let her on
the plane,' like he
   was talking to himself.
   "Then I go to get on the plane since we're all done
and everything,
   and the American Airlines ticket guy says,' You
can't get on the
   plane.' I say, 'Why not?' ... He says, 'Because
this guy says you
   didn't cooperate with the search.' ... I said,
'Didn't you see him
   grab my arm?' He said, 'No, your back was to me.'
   "He said, 'Maybe we can get you on the 4:00 plane,
it's the last one
   today.' I felt, okay, let's put up with this
aggravation now and    go to Chicago and we'll see what we can do... Then
this little guard
   guy, it wasn't enough to stop me, wasn't done with
me. He said,    with me.' I followed very slowly, I sat down for a
while. I said I'm
   carrying these bags; I need a rest... It's called
passive    "He went and found the airport police to come and
talk with me. He
   went and got six other National Guard guys and they
all approached    Here are these six untrained, ignorant,
   don't-know-how-to-deal-with-the-public,
machine-gun-armed young guys
   in their camouflage suits with their military gear
hanging off of    "I looked up and started laughing, 'Is all this for
me, guys? What    this about?' There was this big burly guy, he was
in front. He said,
   'You didn't cooperate with the search.' ... I said
what he did was
   grabbed my arm, and I backed away... He said he
only hit your arm. I
   said even if that's all he did, he's not allowed to
do that. He    hit my arm and demand I listen to him.
   "They had the airport policeman tell me, 'You're
not flying out of
   this airport today.' ... Of course I had
cooperated; why do I care    they search my bags? ... What I didn't like was
being singled out
   because of my political views. They couldn't arrest
me because there
   was no reason for that. They had people who saw
there was nothing to
   arrest me for. They wanted to get back at me
somehow because I was    a subservient female, because I questioned their

this just today?'
   He said, 'I don't know.' One clerk said, 'You could
drive to Boston
   [five hours away] and see if you can get out of
   "I never made it out of Bangor. I had to turn
around and drive 100
   miles back home... The fact that they gave the
other airlines my
   name... They told me they did that... That's
