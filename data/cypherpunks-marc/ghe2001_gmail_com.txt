Thanks. I just downloaded it from their site, and I'm doing Gmail on
it now. It's pretty cute.

How do you get a tor GUI?
Jessie, XFCE
I just installed tor, and it doesn't show up in XFCE's Applications
menu. I tried to start it on the CL, and it did a lot of getting
ready, then stopped and didn't display a GUI or what I get from lynx.
Solutions greatly appreciated...
