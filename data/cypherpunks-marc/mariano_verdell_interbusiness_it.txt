Hi Cypherpunks, The consequences for patients can be tragic: If their pain goes untreated, it can rage out of control. New research shows that prolonged pain can cause lasting changes in the spinal column and the brain stem, turning what had been side streets into roaring freeways for pain signals. You do not want to be one.
We have a global network of health professionals with one common goal: to provide a convenient, globally accessible, affordable and safe means in acquring the latest drugs available for all.
