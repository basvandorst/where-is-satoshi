Wow I will need this for a few days so I will print this message. I have some old rpm packages I need to load.
Thanks, Karl

Yes that is correct! I was changing the volume and listening to skype test and no changes. You change volume then start Skype.
    I'm using Skype Test to do the recording so I was sure pleased when it worked and I could hear my recorded voice.
    Well I did play with the terminal Alsa presentation and that turned me off. I had one terminal open to man alsa and the other with the alsa showing. It got really stupid...my fault.
    I like the GUI Alsa Volume on FC6 but I wish it would keep the settings I have changed. On FC4 the thing asked if you wanted to save it. Smart.

Hi Gang,
    Well! I went looking on FC6 and I found at System->Preferences near the bottom Volume Control. I clicked and it came up and sure enough under Capture the setting was x'ed out with a red X. I clicked on them and they went away. I moved the Microphone lever way up and then killed the Volume control.
    I tried skype and still no mike output!!!
    Really mad I brought up Volume Control and under Capture the DARN red X's were still there!!!! I erased them again and clicked on Help and it was there but no help on my problem. So I just started futzing with things, then quit, then bring up and on about the 6th cycle the Red X's were GONE from the Microphone!
    I started Skype and called the Test number and to my surprise my recorded words were played back. I did 3 tests and all three worked. I called a couple of friends but they didn't answer.
    Now I know what to do. No Mike, remove the Red X's about 5 times and maybe it will work again.

I enjoy using Skype so I got one from their web page they say is a Beta Version. When I rpm the package it came up with 5 bad dependents. So I used yum install and one after the other I loaded the needed software. Slowly the list got smaller and then it worked.
    I brought it up and it looks odd but it works and I see the guys I talk with. But I checked the system and like last time, I have good listening audio but the Mike is dead!
    Without a doubt the software to adjust the sound card audio has gone way downhill since FC4.

I have the FC5 version of Skype that ran fine on F7 but on F8 I have to find 5 FC5 packages available to answer the failed dependencies.  I think there is a way to yum these 5 things  but I don't know how to do it easy.
