I have just tried your script but it gives the same error on my computer.
And this even after uninstalling and re-installing mod_perl2 and libapreq2
(latest versions) using ppm.
I am using Apache 2.055, ActivePerl 5.8.7 under Windows 2000.
It is very strange. This happends after re-installing Windows, and perl and
all the modules, but if I use the old version of perl (5.8.6) which made
that program work fine, it gives that error also now.
I have also upgraded from Apache 2.054 to 2.055, but I don't think this
could be the problem.
Thank you.

[Tue Jan 10 22:05:34 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Can't locate object
method "FETCH" via package "APR::Table" at e:/web/modules/Modul.pm line
The line 35 of that script contains:
my ($session_id) = $r->headers_in->{Cookie};
I have read perldoc APR::Table and I have seen that it says that this module
has a "FETCH" method.
I have tried upgrading Apache2::RequestIO, Apache2::RequestUtil,
Apache2::RequestRec, APR, APR::Table, but cpan said that the latest version
is installed.
The modules loaded by that script that gives errors are:
use Apache2::RequestRec ();
use Apache2::RequestIO ();
use Apache2::RequestUtil ();
use Apache2::Const -compile => qw(:common);
Thank you.
