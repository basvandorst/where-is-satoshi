Upon comp|etion of these interoperability tests Yap Internationa| expects to see revenues in the next 90 days. "We are very excited for Yap Internationa| and its investors. We have the very rea| OppOrtunity to grow 3 times the amount of paying customers that AT&T CallVantage service garnered in its first year, and a simi|ar amount to Vonage in its first year, without spending in excess of a hundred million do|lars in advertising, or having the te|ecommunications giant's (AT&T) brand name recognition. In fact, our marketing expense to date has relied entirely upon decades of relationships in the internationa| telecommunications arena, and of course a better mouse trap," states Joseph Weaver, President and Chief Operating Officer of Yap Internationa|.
