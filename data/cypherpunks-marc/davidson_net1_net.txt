Dear Declan,
Ooo!  Brake fluid and gasoline in... a motor car!
How dare he!
And what's all this about posting "explosives information"
on the Internet.  International Development posts info on explosives  and nobody arrests them.
DuPont sells explosives, nobody arrests them.  Oh, but, yeah,
DuPont had that director on the Second Bank of the United
States Board, so they must be okay.
I gather that the First Amendment freedom to post information
to web sites is now gone, victim to the "USA Patriot Act"
along with the Second Amendment freedom to keep and bear
arms.  So, when are you Americans gonna have another
American Revolutionary War?  The one from 1861-1865 didn't
work out, but that's no reason to stop now.
So, the illicit finds are: computers.  I have 'em.  Literature
advocating revolution: I have Patrick Henry's "The War
Inevitable" and other writings, so I've got that, too.
Iced tea bottles.  Got 'em.  Flammabel materials.  Got 'em.
Gas masks.  Got 'em.  Anarchist flag?  No, but I've got a
Jolly Roger.  Does that count?  It is black, after all.
Got it.  I mean, I live on a farm.
Got 'em.  You can never have too much brake fluid. If
your car won't start, that's a problem, but if it won't
stop, that's an accident.
Wow.  Urban thuggery.  I gotta tell Mom!
