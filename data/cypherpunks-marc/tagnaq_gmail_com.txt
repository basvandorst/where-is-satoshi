I think karsten's graphs from  fit also well to this thread:

Could you have a look at:
and tell me if you see Tor connecting to your mailserver in Vidalia's
"Tor Network Map"?

I suppose it is a timing/delay issue since 50.7.228.92 is included in
the current version of
Generally speaking you can never say that a user that is coming from
an IP address that is *NOT* listed as an exit node is *NOT* coming
through Tor.
This is because Tor exit relays might use separate IP addresses on
inbound and outbound traffic.
The inbound address is announced and can be found in the consensus but
the outbound traffic (the one gmail.com will see) is not necessarily
the one that can be found in the consensus if a server is specifically
configured to do so or if he is behind a NAT.
So I would suggest to allow *ANY* IP address as soon as you know that
the actual user specifically opted-in to be a "Tor gmail user" (if the
user completed one of your two options described) - any other approach
will only mean trouble for Tor users on the long run.
thanks for bringing this up here!

Hello Mike,
thank you for providing this information on this mailing list - really
I'm using Tor to fetch and send emails since quite some time but never
reached the point where I didn't get any 'Suspicious sign in
prevented' emails from google anymore.
I got used to it and occasionally verified if the IP address in
question was an exit node at the given time.
Yesterday google decided to lock my account (not the first time) even
though I used your described procedure (2) a while ago and hoped that
I should be fine now.
Did google revisit it's procedures or is this expected behaviour even
after following your described procedure (2) and with "relaxed
security checks"?
As several times before - I was able to unlock my account answering
the security question, but this is becoming a continuous burden.
kind regards,
tor-talk mailing list

In case you are trying to improve the system to prevent false
positives and need some feedback:
I still get 'Suspicious sign in prevented' emails (4 in the last
month) and was forced to change the password - but luckily I still
have access to my account.
Gmail blocked access when coming from ~8 different IP addresses - all
of which where tor relay IPs (verified via metrics.torproject.org).
I suppose you can see the IP addresses in my "account history" in case
you need them for debugging purposes.
If I should direct these emails to someone else let me know - thanks.

Yes, and I still believe this is the best option, because even with
the best possible 'tor exit IP list generator' - implementation you
will get false negatives [1].

Correct, it wasn't a web-signin.
I started a thread for it here:

I'd suggest the following:
Run an hourly job that gives you a list of tor relay IP addresses that
actually allow exit traffic to *your* services.
To achieve this you probably want to run a tor client to get an
authoritative consensus. Then you can parse that data to produce the
final IP address list for simple and fast offline lookups (simple IP
address comparision).
Exonerator is probably a good starting point that can be reused and
modified to your needs without a lot of effort.

We still get 'Suspicious sign in prevented' emails:
The following relay was used:
Note: The relay has no 'exit' flag (not fulfilling the minimum
requirements for that), but still allows exiting on certain ports.
Thank you for forwarding this email to the relevant people.
Would be great if they could share a timeline on when this issue will
 finally be fixed (if at all) - thanks!
