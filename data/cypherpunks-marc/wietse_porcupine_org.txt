The text says:
    Trusted (peer certificate signed by trusted CA, unverified peer name)
    Verified (peer certificate signed by trusted CA, verified peer name)
The difference is that the client verifies that the name(s) in the
certificate match with the name of the host that the client wanted
to connect to.
TLS_README goes into the details of verification.
You could be talking to the wrong server, some man in the middle,
or anything else than the desired host.

This clarifies what is/isn't optional and why one might want to
make some change.  Only those who want the gory details should
have to consume the entire document.

In this section, the commands that compute the parameters PRECEDE
the text that says why one might want to do this.
This is not a skimming error, it is a presentation error.

    Note: greater security against "pre-computation" attacks against
    EDH can be obtained by periodically regenerating the EDH
    parameters as above (an hourly or daily cron job running as
    root can automate this task). The parameter files are not secret,
    after all these are sent to all SMTP clients in the clear. Mode
    0644 is fine.
However, this comment is (still) in the wrong place. It should
precede the commands that compute the parameters and that set
smtpd_tls_mumble_param_file stuff.
