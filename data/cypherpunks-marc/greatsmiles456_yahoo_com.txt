You may recognize me from television or magazines I've appeared in.  I've been modeling for several years now but I've never made it big.  I have done a lot of fun assignments though.  I was even on an episode of Baywatch!
So you are probably wondering why I'm looking for men on the internet. For the simple fact that I'm tired of the singles scene.  I'm sick of guys trying to pick me up at bars without even getting to know me.  The internet is such a great way to get to know each other!
I even have my own homepage so you can get to know me.  I designed and maintain this page myself.  All the pics are really me and the contact info is all mine!  Get to know me online and then maybe we can make that real world connection!
Please visit my slice of cyberspace.  I know this site isn't too flashy, but like I said...I built it myself!
