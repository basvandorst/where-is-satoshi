What is this propaganda?  Any system record can be problamatic. Hell operating system's debug (windows dump for instance) files can be used to reverse engineer systems.  Are we going to suggest that setup log files are even an issue?  How about Microsoft's system reporting system?  Do you see where I am going with this?  You may as well unplug your router if you hold this sort of view.

Such systems may already be around.  This of course raises the debate surrounding unbreakable codes.

It was so easily broken because of lack of knowledge.  Poor implementation is the enemy.
