hi Jorge,
as Stephan wrote earlier, it's likely a Ubuntu specific breakage in the
SDK package (libreoffice-dev) that they provide.  please try it with a
LO downloaded from libreoffice.org or built from source following the
description [1] and report back.  if you want to develop LO itself (as
opposed to an extension) you will need to build LO from source anyway.
