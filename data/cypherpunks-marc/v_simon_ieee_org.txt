   The algorithm is publicly known since over 20 years, so It start to be not that young anymore.  As an argument, ECDSA is one of the recommended algorithm by NIST and approved in FIPS 186-2.
   It is also known that the NSA, the government of Canada and probably many other countries use ECC to protect at least some of their sensitive information.  It seems that ECDSA is also already used by at least some banks, but I don't know well enough to be sure.
   Here another argument to support ECC trustiness:
"NSA has determined that beyond the 1024-bit public key cryptography in common use today, rather than increase key sizes beyond 1024-bits, a switch to elliptic curve technology is warranted."
   Note that NSA also ask that current electronic signatures be strong enough to last at least 50 years, which is something certainly not OT on this list.
   That said, 2 years ago I was looking at ECC, and then found out that there is apparently hundreds of patents in USA, not directly on ECC, but on different optimisation, family of curves with special properties, small variations with ECC, an unknown number of undisclosed submarine patents and so on.  That alone is enough to discourage ECC in free software for years (and in closed source software where companies are afraid of being    Another point, and not the least, is that implementing ECC properly is very difficult and error prone.  That said, here OSS probably have an advantage as scholars will tend to study implementations for which they have the source code.
   NIST is saying that RSA-1024 will be ok for up to 2010, but that you should prepare to switch to something more secure in the next few years. It also means that if there is something you need to protect for more than 5 years, you should not use RSA-1024.
