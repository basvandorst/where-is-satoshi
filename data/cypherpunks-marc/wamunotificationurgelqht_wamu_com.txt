Security Center Advisory!
                Washington Mutual is committed to maintaining a safe
                for its community of buyers and sellers. To protect
the security
                of your account, Washington Mutual employs some of the most
                security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly
                screen the Washington Mutual system for unusual activity.
                We recently have determined that different computers
have logged
                onto your Washington Mutual Online Banking account,
and multiple
                password failures were present before the logons. We now need
                you to re-confirm your account information to us. If
this is not
                completed by Feb 25, 2005, we will be forced
                to suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used
                for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in
                this manner.                 In order to confirm your Online Bank records, we may require
                specific information from you.
                Please follow the link below and renew your account information
                :                 Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please
                that this is a security measure meant to help protect you and
                your account.                 We apologize for any inconvenience.
                If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choise but
                to temporaly suspend your account.
                Thank you for using Washington Mutual!
