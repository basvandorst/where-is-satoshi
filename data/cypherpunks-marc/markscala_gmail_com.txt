thanks for the heads up.  I read other posts on this error, but it's
unclear to me whether the following will be a problem as well.  Suppose
I break up my very long module into smaller modules and import them
into another module 'main'.  Will I get the same error running main if
the total number of lines in the smaller modules is > 10k?

Anyone know what this error means?
