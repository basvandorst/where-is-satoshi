I don't know that I'd call it "auditing" exactly; to my knowledge, no
audit as such has been undertaken with the kernel. That said, evidently,
a pair of the "many eyes" did ferret this one out, about 9 weeks ago:
Unfortunately, he did not see it as critical enough to throw out
security alerts and make a new release right then, so anyone with
untrusted local users was completely unprotected. Including Debian,

So is it prohibited that drug companies are compelled to disclose known
side effects of their medications in order to sell them, and treason on
the part of FDA employees who enforce that?

Along these same lines, mightn't a TLA or similar induce someone
downstream of them to spam the cypherpunks remailers and collect the
identities of those who complain?
At any rate, the two problems reduce to the same one. You could filter
AV replies/complaints from the remailers, but there's no way to stop the
automoton/spamee from directing it to the virus "sender"/upstream
provider directly.
Perhaps people who run AV systems which send out automated notifications
deserve any unwanted attention they might get this way.

a couple nitpicks on otherwise interesting points...
There's a well-supported extension for that: Actually, plans are in the works to make S/MIME an extension as well, so
the two will soon be on equal footing.
Out-of-band transmission of known-hosts entries has been standard
operating procedure everywhere *I* have used ssh for the past 10 years.
I thought everyone did that.

No. AIUI the CC company is not obligated by the state to offer joe any credit
at all in response to his application. They may reject him based on his
nonpayment twenty years later. They simply may not attempt to collect the old debt. Also, in practice, the people who aggregate such information
from other creditors will have a hard time reporting on the old default.
But you are not obligated to extend any credit that you do not wish to
