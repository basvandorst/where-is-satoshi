@_subject: Re: Bitcoin 
My language was a bit strong about not being able to convert them to
other currencies. However, if  is any
indication of the market for Bitcoin exchange, there was a total
worldwide transaction volume of maybe $8,000 today. That doesn't give me
much confidence that I'll be able to exchange any significant value
without an unacceptable price adjustment. I've seen evidence that the cost of electricity to create a bit coin
currently exceeds it's value. I wish I could fine the source now. I'd
bet against major acceptance of bitcoins.
