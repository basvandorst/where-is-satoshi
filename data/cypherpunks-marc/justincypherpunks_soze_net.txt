Never fear; if you forget your password and the secret token used for

All they need is your account info, birthdate, and the last 4 digits of
your SSN.
Secure, indeed.  Even after most people realize the utility of
relatively strong _required_ passwords being used, as they often are in
movies, to deal with banks, they are satisfied when real banks use two
publicly available pieces of information and 13 bits of your
maybe-or-maybe-not-so-secure SSN is good enough.
Imagine the panic if Americans were required to use passwords like
"b2\9690d" to access their bank accounts.  I suppose the objection would

But the U.S. position since way before the war has been that this is not

Are you suggesting that we might try to get the ICC to handle Saddam's
trial and that they'd refuse on the grounds that it was a
Bush/Blair/Howard junta that went to war rather than an international
coalition?  It would be highly amusing if the ICC signatories were to
say that, but I don't see it happening.
Even if the United States wants to reform the Iraqi judicial system to
incorporate most or all of U.S. rights (which really don't exist here
anymore thanks to decades of creative work by the Supremes), I think
that goal is orthogonal to the matter of how to treat Saddam.  The Iraqi
courts haven't been reformed yet.  There's no Iraqi constitution, and
the country isn't even sovereign, in the sense that there's no permanent
system of authority or law.  If Iraqi courts are to be used, do
prisoners just have to sit around for years until the process generates
a criminal justice system with adequate procedural guarantees?  I would
think that the current courts have to be used, regardless of what shape
they're in.
We really have no direct control over what goes on in Iraq.  We can use
diplomacy to try to influence what the governing council does, but it's
the governing council that's creating a constitution.  I'm really not
sure what we'd do if the governing council were to come up with a
constitution without the equivalent of our 4th-8th amendments.  Would we
march into the meeting chamber and kick everyone out, and seat military
commanders at the table instead?
Also, there's an existing (1968) constitution in Iraq, ignoring the
post-coup modifications, and Saddam ignoring it for a few decades
doesn't mean it's bad.  I haven't read it in translation and I don't
know Arabic, so I can't say what the old constitution guarantees in
terms of criminal procedure.  But allegedly it wasn't a terrible
constitution, and it probably guarantees something.
How much influence can we exert without turning Iraq into a U.S.
territory?  It's easy to argue that we've gone too far already by
screening Governing Council members.  Are you suggesting that Iraq
should be a U.S. territory?  If the Governing Council is a puppet, does
it matter whether they have fair trials?  I would think in that case
that any trials they conducted would be invalid, even if no other
countries were to object.
Just because we're there and we're trying to set up a democracy that has
some toleration for religious freedom and speech doesn't mean we have an
obligation to turn Iraq into a puppet state and run U.S. trials for
people who violated Iraqi law.

As Bill Stuart pointed out, this is not an American war.  This is a war
(or so the U.S. claims) based on alleged violation of an agreement
between Iraq and the UN.  It seems to me that American Courts or
American Tribunals have no authority to preside over Saddam's case in
general.  I don't think anyone wants to try Saddam for crimes over which
the U.S. might have jurisdiction.  There's likely a much better case
that he killed various subordinates, or that he gave orders to murder a
bunch of Kurds, or that he murdered various people in his ascent into
power, than there is that he offered material support to Al Qaeda or
some other terrorist group.
Even if such a U.S. law-based prosecution were to be pursued, clearly
there are serious international law issues.  Saddam was not some rag-tag
nation-less scoundrel.  Even if he was directly involved in terrorism, I
would think the only way to prosecute him for any such crimes would be
in some international court, because he was essentially sovereign.
Please explain why an Iraqi court must give Saddam U.S. style procedural
rights, because I don't understand.  I know you said "should", but what
does that mean if not "must"?  The U.S. has no influence on Iraqi
judicial proceedings, or at least it shouldn't.  Appeals to ethics don't
mean anything when one talks about a different culture.

I'm still not convinced of the utility of just setting up a base on

terraforming.  And what are we supposed to do for the hundreds of years

to actually utilize Mars has nothing in particular to do with a Mars
base, and could probably be more effectively engineered here on Earth or
in Earth orbit, I'll retract my baseless cost estimates for a Martian

FreeS/WAN made no serious attempt to integrate with the linux kernel's

Kennedy, privacy interests of the family outweigh public right to know.

I hadn't looked it up before, but it seems most countries with
compulsory voting have exemptions for debilitating conditions.  Assuming
that's the sort of scheme you're proposing, proxy voting is unnecessary.
Semantics.  If you're thrown in jail for failing to vote, is that a
voting requirement?  If you're threatened by a gangster with a machine
gun, is that a requirement?  Very few countries throw people in jail for
failing to vote.  Most states either fine violators or revoke their
suffrage.  IDEA.int considers that "compulsory" voting.  You don't.
Your plan would split current rare- or non-voters into two categories,
the ones who are banned from voting due to apathy, and a second group
whose members want to preserve future voting ability.  I would guess
that the latter would end up voting in Presidential elections, and would
only care about the presidential candidates.  That might make things
worse, since such idiotic, uninformed voters might vote along party
lines in other races on the same ballot.  We have enough party-line
voters at the moment.  We don't need any more.
I'm arguing against any sort of coercion - whether it's a loss of
rights, being stuffed in a prison, or being beaten with a stick.  You
consider voting in Australia to be mandatory?  The punishment is a fine,
different from loss of suffrage but not necessarily more serious.
This was apparently a set-up.  Most places have abstention options of
one sort or another.  It doesn't matter that much how you abstain,
whether you can tell them to keep the ballot, whether you can feed blank
ballots into the machines, or whether you have to mark something.
What do you gain by forcing people to go to the polls to mark "abstain",
eat their ballots, or otherwise effectively abstain after showing up?
It would be a lot more logical to require voting if abstention wasn't an
option, though there are still serious problems with mandatory voting.
You seem intent on allowing people to express disinterest in who wins,
but for some unknown reason you want their disinterest to be expressed
within an arbitrarily-designed framework rather than allowing them the
flexibility to vote, show up and abstain, or stay home.
I suspect there's much disagreement as to whether abstention is included
in the concept of "voting".

Requiring that adults vote is a terrible idea.  While being deathly ill

The above proposal only requires 33% turnout among current non-voters.
While that's certainly an "improvement" (by your metric), it doesn't
resolve the core issues.
If not voting is the sin you seek to prevent, why settle for 33 percent?
If it is dumb voters you're trying to eliminate, requiring them to drive
their dumb asses to the polls isn't going to make then any smarter or
more informed.  It might even increase stupid voting patterns by
encouraging dumb people to form cliques.  They won't want to appear dumb
to their friends as a result of voting for the "wrong person," and
groupthink is bad for elections.
There is an abstention option.  The poll administrator checks off your
name when you show up, so someone knows that you "voted."  You don't
have to choose anyone on your ballot.  You can either toss it in the
garbage on your way out, or draw pictographs derogatory to politicians
on non-critical areas of the ballot before feeding it to the

Sandy has discovered the deep dark secret of crypto! I worked for Intel

Every crypto key is secretly recorded by Intel microprocessors. Motorola
processors do not yet record keys, which I why use a Macintosh. The
specific instruction is the so-called "NSA instruction" which John Gilmore
identified some time ago. Sun Microsystems was ordered by the NSA to redesign their chips to capture
keys, which is why the SPARC processor was introduced. SPARC stands for
"Sun Processor Allowing Remote Capture."
Once the keys have been captured and stored on the user's hard disk (notice
how the drives occasionally turn on a night?), they are forwarded to the
NSA and National Surveillance Organization by "screen saver" programs, like
"After Dark," which were actually written by the Berkeley Microsystems
cut-out operation of the NSO. Real hackers don't use cutesy screen saver
This new automated system is much more convenient than the previous system,
where the FBI and NSO had to break into homes and offices in order to
retrieve the keys the Intel processors had recorded.

In practice, intelligence is never accurate.  Hitting only military

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Law enforcement officials said on Monday they are
looking for a man seen taking pictures of two refineries in Texas City,
Texas City, located on the Texas Gulf coast about 30 miles south of
Houston, has three refineries including the largest U.S. plant operated
by BP Plc., which is the third-largest U.S. refinery, processing 470,000
barrels of crude oil per day.
The man, described as white with dark hair, was seen taking pictures
outside the refineries, all located on the same highway, at about 5 p.m.
CDT on Saturday, said Bruce Clawson, emergency management and homeland
security director for Texas City.
While it is not illegal to take pictures of a refinery from a highway or
street, officials would like to talk to the man to find out his reason
for taking the photographs.
"This is based on the idea that al Qaeda does its homework," Clawson
said. "That's not to say we don't have enough home-grown idiots already
who might want to do something."
The man was seen driving a white van.
Valero Energy Corp. operates a 243,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in
Texas City. Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, a joint venture between
Marathon Oil Corp., and Ashland Inc., operates a 76,000 bpd refinery in
Texas City.
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has repeatedly warned refiners
that they are possible targets for would-be terrorists. U.S. refinery
security officials say their security guards regularly report people
observing or taking pictures of refineries.
During the Independence Day holiday, ExxonMobil Corp. tightened security
at the largest U.S. refinery, the 538,000 bpd plant in Baytown, Texas,
30 miles east of Houston, because of general warnings about possible
terrorist activity.

representatives that mirror their views.  That's where the blame lies.
What do you want?  Do you want everyone to vote Democrat, Libertarian or

The reason we don't have any socialists or libertarians or fascists in

fixation on voting for one of the two major parties.  Other countries do
not; that's why some of them have multi-(3+)-party representation in

elector selection, that blame lies with the States; the States dictate
how their electors are chosen.

the ones you wanted is irrelevant.
Presidential elections are a mess, though.  Most states' selection of
electors for presidential selection may violate the intent of the
Constitution's writers; the electors for most states were originally
selected by legislators.
The winning-party-take-all system in most states does seem to violate
the intent of election mechanics.  Notably, there is a difference
between having 3 electors and having 1 elector with 3/538 of a say in
president selection.  The current system may be too much like the
IMO, your complaint about gerrymandering is valid.  There are a variety
of formulaic ways to ensure voting district compactness.  See e.g.
Nevertheless, there is a fundamental inconsistency between two
requirements that everyone seems to want:
1) coherent voting districts
2) equal-population voting districts.
No matter what criteria are used for creating equal-population voting
districts, there are always going to be multiple ways to choose them, so
someone will always complain.
It's the same sort of thing as voting procedure itself; there are
multiple ways to conduct a democratic election.  The fact that most of
the population is unaware of the alternatives (in the case that no
option gets a majority: 1st/2nd/3rd choices, run-offs, no run-offs,
etc.) doesn't mean they're any less serious.  Perfectly democratic
elections run by different rules have different results.  It's amazing
anyone even bothers to complain about the y2k election when there are
issues like this lurking under the bridge.
Clearly, no matter what you do, there are problems.  If the district
size is 1 million, there's a city of 499k and a city of 1501k, what
then?  The city of 499k is screwed unless there's a nearby population
center with similar culture.  Even then, the numbers won't be equitable,
and someone, somewhere will whine about "lack of representation."

I'm torn on Interventionism, and I suppose everyone is in some way.  I
believe that no matter how "oppressed" someone is, they can still
accomplish great things.  Based on that alone, there is little reason to
intervene in other countries' societies even if their governments are
perpetuating discrimination.
I also think it's a mistake to say that the U.S. has been so successful
because it's a democratic republic.  Wasn't it the spirit of those who
rebelled against British rule, rather than the particular form of
government they established, that was critical in establishing the U.S.
as a progress-oriented nation?
A semi-free society that has fewer economic regulations will have more
companies, and more capital that can be directed to pay people to do
research or to fund development of abstract ideas into usable
technologies.  However, even though economic deregulation aides
progress, is that a justification for rebellion or for war?
Consider Saudi Arabia.  Ignore the House of Saud's ties with the Bush
family, for a moment.  I hope everyone will agree that Saudi society and
government discriminates significantly in its treatment of men vs women.
Hopefully everyone will also agree that there are some, though certainly
a minority, of both men and women in Saudi Arabia who do not like their
rights under sharia and under the monarchy.  They want some guarantee of
equal rights, at least equal treatment by government (in matters of
divorce, voting, women's travel w/o closest-male-relative's permission,
etc.).  Ignore the "dress code" -- abaya and all that -- of Islamic law.
I'm interested in more substantive rights, rather than purely social
(non-government-enforced) discrimination.
1) Do individuals in that minority have a right to equal treatment by
2) Does the fact that they are not numerous enough to foment a rebellion
mean they don't have that right?
3) Is there something inherently different about
equal-treatment-by-government, vs a discriminatory system under sharia,
that makes aiding a rebellion "good" or at least "neutral" in an
absolute moral sense?  Can intervention be justified?
4) If (3), can secondary considerations (oil access, "friendly
democracies" in the middle east, etc.) nullify any moral right to
intervene on behalf of an oppressed minority?
5) If (3), do a people with the means to displace discriminatory
governments have a _duty_ to do so?  (whether the U.S. has the means,
given that any military operation will increase government debt, is
If the U.S. has a right to invade other countries based on
government-enforced discrimination, do they have a right to invade the
U.S. based on democracies' tendency to produce a population rendered
brain-dead by the media and by demagogues?  How does the U.S. tendency
to create world-leading corporations mitigate the fact that many of its
citizens are vegetables?

by the educational system, by media, and by government?  Because in such

Customs service seizes depleted uranium in Russia region28.01.2005, 13.28
   MOSCOW, January 28 (Itar-Tass) - The customs service in a Volga region  has seized more than 37 kilograms of depleted uranium.    A spokesman at the Federal Customs Service told Itar-Tass on Friday  that workers of the Orenburg customs service spotted the dangerous cargo  on Wednesday during examination of a car with a radiation detector.    The radiation-emitting object was a cylindrical protective container  intended for remote manipulation with radioactive substances.    It contained 37.5 kilograms of uranium-238, which is a depleted form.    An owner of the container described it in a customs declaration as a  dumb-bell. He said he had found it at a dump and used it for exercise  and sometimes straightened nails with it.    Specialists are looking for the origin of the container.    A criminal case on an attempt of contraband of a radioactive substance  has been opened.    Specialists of the Russian Agency of Atomic Energy told Itar-Tass that  neither a conventional nor dirty bomb could be made from the confiscated  amount of uranium.     Uranium-238 is one of the most available elements in the earth crust.  About 60,000 tonnes of uranium a year is extracted in the world. © ITAR-TASS. All rights reserved.

@_subject: Re: Police Worried About New Vest-Penetrating Gun 
There are various levels of body armor specified by the NIJ.  In order
of effectiveness (lower to higher): Levels IIa, II, IIIa, III, and IV.
Level IV typically takes the form of a trauma plate and is put into a
pouch in the front (and/or in the back) of soft body armor.  III and IV
are heavier, bulkier, and as a result aren't used as much.
The NIJ standards are based on stopping standard bullets up to certain
velocity limits (preventing them from going through the vest), _plus_
"backface deformation" limits.  They put the vests over geletin, and the
volume displaced by the vest when it absorbs the shot is measured and
must be less than a specified limit.  There is a lot of sentiment that
this testing method is crap, and all that should matter is whether the
bullet goes through the vest.  Or at least that backface deformation
should be less heavily emphasized.
Then there are other specifications outside of the NIJ scheme; for
instance, the there's "PAGST" and "CRISAT" body armor.  I don't recall
what they stand for.
A lot.  5.56mm pistols (based on the AR-15 and available from olympic
arms or bushmaster, among other manufacturers) are perfectly legal and
will shoot through IIIa vests.  The real jump up is between IIIa and
III; the former mainly stops handgun rounds, while the latter allegedly
stops standard .223 and .308 loads, but I'm not sure... before I looked
it up just now, I thought only level IV trauma plates stopped .308.
Cops typically wear level II or IIIa armor.
And even trauma plates will not stop repeated hits to the same area.  If
you expect to be shot at with a rifle, you do not want to be out in the
open where many hits are unavoidable.  Ceramic plates weaken through
chipping, and metal plates weaken through stress/deformation.
Of course.  Otherwise it would be a machine gun, and new machine guns
are not available to civilians... and haven't been since the 1986
Firearm Owners Protection Act.
The anti-gun forces try hard to associate the assault weapons ban expiry
with the availability of machineguns.  They are lying.
This gun, the Five-seveN, has been available for years.  What hasn't
been available for years, I don't think, is the "practice" non-AP
ammunition.  And, of course, some FFLs (gun dealers) are unwilling to
sell the Five-seveN to private citizens.
Other armor-piercing handguns include .223 pistols and the CZ 52; there
are also nasty rounds, though generally unavailable, for 9mm handguns
that will penetrate IIIa armor.  Ordinary rounds at +P+ pressures may
even do it.  The Five-seveN bullets have a muzzle velocity about half-way between
handgun bullet velocities and rifle bullet velocities.  Given the round
diameter (5.7mm) and the short barrel (compared to rifles) of the
Five-seveN, it's essentially a rifle round.  5.56mm pistols fire rounds
with nearly the same diameter, though they weigh more (5.7mm bullets are
~30gr, standard 5.56mm is 55 or 62gr) and therefore require more powder
to achieve the same velocities.  Hence the longer cartridges for 5.56mm
(I use .223 and 5.56 interchangably; they're technically not the same
thing but close enough for government work).
Most .223 pistols are based on the AR-15, so their magazines attach
outside of the pistol grip and make them look scarier.  That also makes
them slightly less concealable, which is why they're not being attacked
by the anti-gun forces.  Perhaps the anti-gunners don't think they're
Uzis, MP5s, short-barrelled rifles.  They'll have top of the line
handguns; If I were a criminal, I'd carry what I'd carry anyway, a
Walther p99 compact plus several full p99 mags (they work in the p99
compact, something that cannot be said for H&K P2000 mags and the P2000
Don't be fooled by the association with James Bond.  The factory p99 is
an excellent gun (if you don't mind polymer).  The PPK is another story.
I don't know what criminals think is practical.  Very few criminals make
killing police officers their primary objective, for obvious reasons.
The fact that they get into a shooting at all implies that they have
planned, at some level, to kill police if they need to.  The statistics
speak for themselves.  It's rare to see rifles involved unless the
criminal is at home, in a car, or actively committing a crime (and even
in the last case, they're less common than in homes and cars).
middle of the page, "Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted"
According to the 2003 pdf, in 2003, 34 officers were killed with a
handgun, 10 killed with a rifle (out of 52 murders).  34 of the 52 were
wearing body armor.
On page 35 of the pdf (document p. 27), handguns were the murder weapon
in 56 ambush situations, compared with only 28 where rifles were the
murder weapon.
They are not bullet-proof.  That's a term the anti-gun forces like
because it implies that any gun/ammo combination that will defeat the
vests are somehow magical or evil.  And yes, the majority of officers,
particularly city police, wear soft body armor.  Typically it is NIJ
level 3a or level 2, so it will not stop high-pressure or
maliciously-shaped standard-caliber handgun rounds, nor 5.7mm
(Five-seveN), nor 7.62x25mm Tokarev (CZ 52).  The CZ 52 can be found in
very good condition for $100-125.  I recall advice from somewhere that
the CZ 52 firing pin should be replaced with a titanium one on account
of reliability and safety concerns.
It's a problem for any cop wearing common body armor.  Most beat cops
and detectives wear it.  I don't know about SWAT teams -- of course they
wear some sort of armor, but I'd guess level 3 and possibly trauma
plates as well.  I don't know how the Five-seveN training rounds do
against level 3, but I'd guess they are stopped.
Of course it's not a practical concern.  Criminals already have access
to handguns that will defeat common soft body armor.  This media panic
was instigated by a press release from the Violence Policy Center, which
has evidently (for now) given up trying to pass a new assault weapon
ban, and is instead finding new legislative targets.

The name is "Five-seveN."  It's made by Fabrique Nationale (FN).
Allegedly the U.S. secret service likes the Five-seveN, along with the
FN P90 (unavailable to civilians except title 2 firearms dealers because
it's only made in a select-fire version).  They both use the same 5.7mm
rounds, which makes logistics easier.  Of course, they also use MP5s and
9mm handguns...
Other guns with civilian-legal "armor-piercing" ammo include the CZ-52,
.223 pistols, and most all rifles.
The real ammo penetrates CRISAT/PAGST armor at 100m and 300m
respectively.  Level 2 or 3a armor is really rather pathetic.
Police have no duty to protect the public.  Anyway, most of "the public"
doesn't walk around wearing vests, so protecting "the public" from these
is no different than protecting them from other firearms.  Protecting
the police from these is no different than protecting them from rifles.
Only trauma plates can stop pointy, high-velocity rounds.

How could they possibly get clue?  Scientists don't want to write
pop-sci articles for a living.  It's impossible to condense most current
research down to digestible kernels that the masses can understand.
SciAm should close down, requiring those who care about science to learn
enough about it to read science journals.
Professors who can teach a QM course well in a semester are rare enough.
I doubt any one of them could write a 5000 word article on quantum
entanglement that would be intelligible to the average cretinous
American who wants to seem smart by reading Sci-Am.  If they want to be
smart, they can start by picking up an undergrad-level book on QM.  But
that requires much effort to read, unlike a glossy 5000 word article.
Journalism should not be a college major.  Journalists in the main know
little about how to write and interview, and less about the topics they
write on.  They don't understand that being able to write (and in many
cases even that ability is in serious doubt) doesn't qualify them to
write on any topic they choose.  Many journalists aren't qualified to
write on anything, not even journalism.

No, I want the right to fair use of material I buy.  If someone sells

My fair use rights should not be held hostage by a stupid majority who

Maybe the market for music won't support DRM-only products, but I

Low-sales books may end up being DRM-only, and I _hate_ reading books on
a screen.  Since DRM-only rare books will satisfy some of the market,
there will be even less pressure on physical book publishers to
occasionally reprint them, thus forcing even more people to buy the
DRM'd ebooks.
I bought an ebook on amazon for $1.99 a couple months ago.  The printed
book was $20.  It was very nearly the worst purchase of my life.  I
won't buy a similarly DRM'd ebook every again, for any amount.  The

Is there a difference between property rights in a society like a pride
of lions, and property rights that are respected independent of social
status?  Or are they essentially the same?  They seem to be different,
but I can't articulate why.  Obviously the latter needs enforcement,
possibly courts, etc., but I can't identify a more innate difference,
other than simply as I described it -- property rights depending on
social status, and property rights not depending on social status.
I don't think any society has ever managed to construct a pure property
rights system where nobody has any advantage.  Without government it's
the strong.  With government, government agents have an advantage, and
rich people have an advantage because they can hire smart lawyers to get
unfair court decisions.  So maybe this is just silly, in which case I
believe even more strongly that formal status-independent property
rights are not the basis of government.

As I said, I think this is wrong.  Mammals other than primates recognize
property in a sense, but it depends entirely on social status.  There is
no recognition of property rights independent of social position.  If a
lion loses a fight, he loses all his property.
Chimp and gorilla communities have the beginnings of monarchy.  Yet they
don't care about religion, and their conception of property rights still
derives from their position in the social ladder.  If not primates, do
any animals besides humans recognize property rights independent of
social position?
I think it's fair to say that religion post-dates government, at least
informal government.  Maybe the first monarchs/oligarchs came up with
religious schemes to keep the peons in line, but I would think that was
incidental, as was the notion of property rights.  Both property rights
and religion depend heavily on the ability for communication, but
monarchy can be established without it.  All the monarch needs is a big
stick and an instinctual understanding of some of the principles much
later described by our good Italian friend Niccolo M.
I think it's fair to say that religion may be more important than
property rights for keeping people in line.  But I think they're both
Okay.  So it's fair to say, then, that we have compromises between
property rights protections and other (perceived yet imaginary?)
property rights protections.  Which is really what it boils down to.
There's no property rights usurpation without some motive behind it.
And motives generally stem from wanting to redistribute property or deny
it to another individual, group, or an entire nation.  Sometimes that
property is land (the excuse for such property redistribution or denial
of ownership is called "self determination"), sometimes it is
intellectual property (the excuse is "information wants to be free")...
sometimes it's explosives (they're TOO DANGEROUS, and only terrorists
have them... are you a terrorist?).

I think it's fair to say that governments initially formed to protect
property rights (although we have no historical record of such a
government because it must have been before recorded history began).
They then developed into monarchies which were only really set up to
protect property rights of the ruler(s).
With the advent of various quasi-democratic forms of government, the law
has been compromised insofar as it protects property rights.  You no
longer have a right to keep all your money (taxes), no longer have a
right to grow 5' weeds in your front yard if you live in a city, and no
longer have a right to own certain evil things at all, at least not
without special governmental permission.  There were analogous
compromises in democratic Athens and quasi-democratic Rome.
When democratic states inevitably fold into tyranny, some of those
restrictions remain.  Right now most states have a strange mix of
property rights protections (e.g. the Berne convention and the DMCA) and
property rights usurpations (e.g. no right to own certain weapons; equal

they shift the blots vertically and compress or expand one of them to

Okay; I accept that.  We can assault ourselves, but we cannot waiver in

She is not functioning, however.  Her rights and the rights of her legal
representative are the same.  Anything that she could have requested in
a living will can be requested by her legal representative, her husband.
That depends on her condition.  If she is merely a brainstem attached to
a beating heart and a bunch of tissue, there are clear reasons for
ending this spectacle.
Utilitarian: she's using medical resources that could help people who
have a chance at recovery.
Utilitarian: the spectacle is diverting time and attention of citizens
who should be focusing on increasing their personal wealth, and by
extension the GDP.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Once she's dead, people
will quickly become less distracted as the media can only run stories in
her wake for so long.
Ethical: She wouldn't want to live like this (the court's accepted this,
but it's still disputed).
Ethical: We don't want to see her live like this (which morphs into "she
wouldn't want US to suffer like this").  I don't think this one's
disputed, though Michael may take that view for financial reasons.
Can she recover to sentience, or is she merely a braindead automaton
capable of swallowing?
So I don't get to define my own notion of "human dignity"?
Three arbitrary thresholds.  Two subjective: "horrible" suffering and

Terri's parents supported the adultery, based on news reports I've seen.
I'm not saying it's morally right for him to cheat on her, but I take a
very dim view of any State involvement in marriage.  As far as I'm
concerned, the marriage granted him the right to represent Terri in a
situation like this, just as if they executed a medical power of
attorney and never got married.  I consider the marriage contract fully
severable.  His "cheating" on her doesn't materially affect any
contractual aspect of the marriage, so unless she's around to get
divorced, he can still legally represent her.

She is a corpse with a heartbeat.  Artificially feeding her against her
wishes and/or the wishes of her husband (whose wishes have precedence
over the wishes of her parents -- if you don't like that, get that law
changed) is sick.  She has become a doll for her parents, who are too
immature to grasp the concepts of "life," "death," and "dignity."
Presumably they're still stuck on "God" and "selfishness."
If I have a living will (in writing or by the decision of a legal proxy)
that restricts certain kinds of treatment, you're more than happy to see
doctors violate that and keep me alive as long as someone on Earth is
willing to pay?  (Even if Terry's parents weren't willing or able to pay
originally -- I don't know, and haven't investigated that aspect of the
case -- if they manage to keep her alive, they'll probably get enough
donations to keep her alive for millenia.)
That is not the way any sane legal or medical system should work.  I
suppose you don't believe in euthanasia either?  It would seem to be
inconsistent if you did.  How can someone choose to die if anyone else
can veto that choice?
Thankfully, Neither Jeb nor George nor the U.S. Congress have any
jurisdiction over this whatsoever.  The courts do.
That is of course true, but not because of the decisions so far in this
case.  The law allows her spouse to decide what artificial means should
be used to keep her alive.  If you don't like it, again, lobby for a
change to the law.
The strong control the weak.  The majority controls the minority.  All
we have here is a governmental system originally set up by the majority
(maybe... at least no internal faction opposed it until 1860), where
some people managed to get into positions of influence within the
governmental machine despite having unpopular beliefs.
I find it amusing that the Republican-dominated national Congress wants
Terry kept alive, while Scalia has been quoted as saying, "Mere factual
innocent is no reason not to carry out a death sentence properly
reached."  Republicans in general can't get anything right because their
belief system is less coherent than any other.  At least the supreme
court didn't reverse the decision... not yet, at least.  That's only
because some of the Republicans are not-so-conservative and they all
know the decision would be affirmed.  Taking the case would just waste
