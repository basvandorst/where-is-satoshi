Doubt it. Google spews out
[see last story of section 1] from March 2001, which attributes the quote to "a note in Humphreys' vehicle".
Unless Humphreys was so inspired by this statement that he took it with him wherever he went. Stranger things have happened, I guess.
The most alarming point is that this is the only evidence quoted in the Ananova article. Criminalizing of the public's perception of the unbranded, uncontrolled portions of the Internet? If they can't see what you're doing, it's probably illegal anyway.
(Also from July, for the SD Memorandum Opinion and Order)
