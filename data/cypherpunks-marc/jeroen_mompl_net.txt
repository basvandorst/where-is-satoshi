You mean the whole innertubes went down because some dewd haxx0red it? I believe that was the claim being made in so many words (maybe he was just trying to land that DARPA job). It's one thing for parts of the innertubes to go down, but the whole thing?

I am very skeptical whenever I see claims of this nature "If I do X I can bring down large global system Y in a matter of minutes/hours" where X involves something reasonably simple any single person with some skill could do.

(I base my rant on the assumption megaupload had outsourced their email to one of those "enterprise level" offerings, such as gmail or yahoo).
If this isn't a convincing argument for using your own physical email servers (with encrypted filesystems and limited log keeping and what have you) and against outsourcing your email, then I don't know.
I understand they can seize your servers and get your email that way if you were not smart enough to delete it and/or use encrypted filesystems.
However it's much much harder to use email against you in preparation of a case when you run your own servers. Because they can't just quietly ask your email provider to hand over the data and forbid them to talk about it...
Besides, running an email server is almost a trivial exercise for any marginally competent IT person. If you can set up a system such as megaupload you for sure can run your own, secure, email servers.
If not ask someone competent enough to do it for you.
