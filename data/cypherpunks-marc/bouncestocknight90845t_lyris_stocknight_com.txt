  The recent anthrax scares have led to a handful of companies being
discovered that have products   available that test and disinfect antimicrobial agents. Vital Living
Products (OTC BB: VLPI) recently   announced it had developed home testing kits for Anthrax and the stock
soared to a 52-week high on   Monday with shares climbing from $0.06 to $2.00. Another company,
Veridien (OTC BB: VRDE)   announced that its sanitizing and disinfecting products are designed
to stop or slow and control   environmental challenges and the stock jumped from $0.05 to $0.13.
Other companies like   eSAFETYWORLD, Cepheid, Vital Living, and Ozolutions, and InVision
Technologies have emerged and   shareholders have been rewarded in this era of fears for personal
safety. Some are calling it the "Anthrax   Bubble."
     WHAT COMPANY WILL BE NEXT IN CONFRONTING BIOLOGICAL THREATS ?
  Who will be the next leader in eradicating bacteria and preventing
biological risks? There is a great deal of investment speculation.
  TRSG Corp. is a leader in selling neutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals,
and health and dietary supplements in   the U.S. and Japan.  The following is an excerpt from a BusinessWire
news release issued today:
        ------  Handheld Anthrax Detection Device -- $50-$100 Price Tag
  *** TRSG ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCT LINE ***
  LAS VEGAS--Oct. 25, 2001--TRSG Corp. (OTC BB: TSGO), a majority-owned
subsidiary of   Gateway Distributors Ltd., Thursday announced it has entered into a
preliminary agreement to acquire   certain assets of Mobility Solutions Inc.  These assets include the
Rest Assured Product Line of hand-held,   low-cost devices used to detect the presence of biological agents such
as Bacillus Anthraci (commonly   referred to as Anthrax) as well as many other biological agents.
  The Rest Assured Biological Agent Detection Product line utilizes UV-A
waves or waves in the 320 to   380 nm range, commonly referred to as black light or wood's light,
that have been determined to not cause   sunburn to human skin though the use of eye protection is recommended
during use. These products are   for detection purposes only and are not intended as a treatment or
cure for any specific disease.
  Ongoing research is being conducted at this time to verify the
product's effectiveness in the use of   identifying the presence of a wide range of biological agents such as
Becillus Anthraci, which is currently   making headlines throughout the world. Independent research
laboratories are conducting this research.

                               ***
          News/Assignment Editors & Sports Writers
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2001--Grand Prix Sports Inc.
(OTC BB:GPRX) announced that it has won both the FIA Formula 3000
International Team Championship and Drivers' Championship for the
2001 season. Coca-Cola Nordic Racing secured the Team Championship
with two races remaining in the 2001 season and has set new team
records for the most podium appearances and team points of any team
since 1985. Appropriately, Coca-Cola Europe Ltd. has extended its
title sponsorship for Nordic Racing for an additional two years.
Coca-Cola Nordic Racing driver Justin Wilson also won the prestigious
Drivers' Championship while teammate Tomas Enge finished in a tie
for second place. Wilson became the first-ever British driver to win
the Drivers' Title and with a 71 point total, eclipsed the all time
single season points record previously held by Formula 1 driver Juan
Pablo Montoya. Enge missed the last F3000 race at Monza, Italy after
being chosen by the Prost Formula 1 team to replace the injured
Luciano Burti for the last three Formula 1 races. Enge successfully
competed in the Italian, American and Japanese Grand Prixes to
finish the Formula 1 season with Prost.
"Obviously, this is the utmost achievement in Formula 3000," stated
Team Principal, Derek Mower. "To win both of these titles is a
testament to the strength of our race team and the support of
sponsors like Coca-Cola and Conoco. Together, we're effectively
tapping into the enormous popularity of global motor sports."
Grand Prix Sports owns 40% of Coca-Cola Nordic Racing and is the
first publicly traded race team in the Formula world, allowing
fans of Formula racing, by and large the world's most popular sport,
the unique opportunity to "own" part of a race team.
