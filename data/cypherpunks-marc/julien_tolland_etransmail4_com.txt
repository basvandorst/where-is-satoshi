@_subject: New "3-in-1" Ink! Top 5 reasons for using it... 
+++ NEW! VersaInk is the most economical solution for ALL your printing needs +++
Here are the Top 5 Reasons why you should use VersaInk for your InkJet printer:
1 - ULTRA-SHARP
VersaInk includes the new metal-complex xFerrone(tm) which is a nanometer sized inorganic pigment. It produces an ultra-sharp contrast and strong light absorption which creates an unmatched saturated black and color experience on both photos and documents.
2 - EXTREEMELY WATERFAST, DURABLE & LIGHT STABLE
VersaInk bonds chemically with paper fibers and surface coating materials. Not water nor any other traditional chemical solvents and agents can separate xFerrone pigments from paper, photo glossy material and fabrics (to make T-shirts). The inorganic metal-complex core of VersaInk's pigments protects against "fading" under light exposure. This property ensures preservation of documents and photos over generations.
3 - 20% ENHANCED YIELD vs. OTHER INKS!
The new ink formulation features higher viscosity and surface tension levels, which cause a reduction in the effective ink droplet size.
The same amount of VersaInk will create 20% more print output than any of the standard inks! 4 - NOW YOU CAN PRINT YOUR OWN CHECKS!
VersaInk is the only ink that supports bank accepted check printing. xFerrone(tm) pigments respond to magnetic field exposure and will make your self created checks pass magnetic check readers at banks and retail stores.
5 - A GREAT PRICE...
... AND get a FREE printer with purchase of your first supply of VersaInk!
