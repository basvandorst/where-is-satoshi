@_subject: Re: William was raided for running a Tor exit node. Please help if 
+1 I strongly disagree as well. I am very interested to see how this case evolves in and out of court. Are Tor exit-node operators going to be given the same rights as ISP's who's networks are used for illegal purposes? I would hope so, but it doesn't seem like that has happened in this case, so I am very interested to hear how the situation pans out.
It is extremely relevant to the Internet community and to free speech in Kind regards,
