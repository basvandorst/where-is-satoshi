Hi this is Suzie emailing back....a friend of the website gave me your email a few weeks ago...I'm usually online everyday so we can chat and maybe we could hook up after as well considering we live pretty close...Anyways, hope to hear from you soon cuz my husband will be out of town next week ;-)
P.S. I left you a msg online so use this email when you log in ;-)
