Hi David,
IIRC there was talk of a new version of RFC 4086 (Randomness Recommendations) being worked on. You might want to contact the authors, particularly Donald Eastlake, and contribute some text.

@_subject: Re: [Cryptography] randomness +- entropy 
My original comment was not a general statement about consuming bits from the PRNG. I said that consuming PRNG bits *before the PRNG is fully seeded* is a double problem:
- The consumer gets low-quality randomness.
- The *next* consumer's entropy is lower, because the first consumer might broadcast the randomness he had just received.
And then Ted said that the consumer in question ("minstrel") does cause the entropy estimate to be decreased, so the second problem does not apply.

When this Minstrel guy reads urandom (which only has 23 bits of entropy at the time), do you reset the entropy estimate to 0? If you don't, and Minstrel broadcasts the random value somehow (in this case, as a timing value) an attacker can easily discover the first 23 bits of entropy which would make guessing the PRNG value of the next consumer much easier.

IPsec is mostly inside enterprises, so actual deployment can only be
counted by asking the vendors (who won't say) or the open source
providers (who don't have reliable numbers).
I don't know what part of encrypted email is done by individuals and
what part is enterprise. But since email in general is becoming less
and less cool, I suspect email encryption will over time become more
of an enterprise thing, and therefore even harder to measure.
