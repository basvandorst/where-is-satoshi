Right.  Most of these people are successful businessmen, some are even
investors.  They know how the hardware business works, just hoping to
get us to do their engineering for free.  This is a fine business model
if you can get it to work.  ;)
This is great.  Thank you.

In general, we encourage people to work on these types of ports of Tor.
   We will work with you and help you turn this into a reality.
However, be aware that it takes work, research, and effort to get tor to
work correctly on these platforms.  I'm sure there are a list of
features "micro-environments" would need to have in Tor to make
everything work better.
We'd love to have the help and your experience in turning this into a
reality.  We have the beginnings of a certification program in place, so
an end-user/customer can tell if this is really tor, works with the
current tor network, is a solid design as good as Tor, or is complete
bunk and merely includes the Tor tarball to say "uses Tor!" for their
marketing purposes.
However, coming up with the idea, and then punting all of the next steps
to the Tor Project doesn't work too well.  I have a list of platforms
that people have stated, "If you can turn Tor into an appliance on
device X, we'll sell it for you and donate x% back to you quarterly."
These platforms include: fonera2, embedded linux variants, polar cloud's
tomato, sheevaplugs, bug lab's modules, openwrt, ddwrt, windows ce,
windows xp embedded, and the list goes on.
In conversations with the requesters, they want:
Step 1) Generate an idea.
Step 2) Wait for Tor Project to do the technical work.
Step 3) Profit!
If only it were that easy.

This thread has wandered way off topic.  I suggest we let it die.  The

For the record, Tor has not heard from the DEA nor US Senators about Silk

Perhaps I wasn't clear.  Pakistan has banned all encryption on the Internet inside their country.  It is unknown how this will be enforced, if at all. There are at least two ways Pakistan can enforce this ban:
1. Block typical ports for encrypted traffic, such as ssh, https, pop3, and imaps; or
2. Require ISPs to deploy deep packet inspection devices that look for any encrypted traffic.  Once they find encrypted traffic, the ISP can be required to  a. simply record that customer X is using encryption and report that to the government; or
 b. block the traffic. If number 1, Tor clients talking to bridges may still work, assuming the bridge isn't running on a blocked port.
If number 2, Tor clients in situation 2a still get recorded, because on the wire, it looks like someone is using encryption. Tor clients in situation 2b means the client will not connect to the next hop, the bridge in this case.
This is all conjecture as we have no more visibility into the enforcement mechanisms than any one else. We are working on pluggable transports and obfuscating the tor procotol so that we can fool a deep packet inspection device to some level. See  for extremely experimental code.

Because encryption is illegal, not ip addresses and port combinations.
At the most basic level, they could just block tcp 443 and probably
stop the most customers with that alone. If the ISPs really care, then
deep packet inspection is the next probability to detect and block
anything the dpi device claims is encrypted traffic.
Bridges aren't public tor relays. So comparing a list of public tor
relays and trying to catch bridge users will not work.

Yes. However, any analysis of the traffic using deep packet inspection
will show it is using encryption which is illegal.

: I talked to someone from the pakistani government about this encryption
ban early this spring.  They were concerned that this law would be far
too broad and demolish whatever nascent e-commerce and online banking
markets that had started in the country.  They were also concerned that
too many people in the government didn't understand the difference
between a VPN and HTTPS. This person talked to American counter-terrorism people and found that
actual terrorists were not using VPNs nor HTTPS at all. They stating
right out in the open, from their registered DSL lines, their plans,
where they lived, and what they were planning to do on various online
chat network and forums.
While technically, yes this law does make anything that uses encryption
on the Internet in pakistan illegal, it was primarily aimed at the
various VPN providers run by known criminal organizations. Tor, HTTPS
Everywhere, and other tools are now illegal. Whether someone is actually
prosecuted for using such tools in country remains to be seen.

: Keyloggers would, I assume, defeat the whole purpose of Tor since the URL would be recorded and sent to the fedz.
If you lose control over your local computer, tor cannot help you. If
the attacker can see every keystroke you enter, you've lost. I'm not
sure if this is true for onscreen keyboards as well.
If the German customs agents took your computer away from you at a
border, you should assume the worst case and no longer trust your OS nor
hardware. It's possible tails may help here, but depending upon hardware
vs. software (bios firmware) attacks, the computer may not be
trustworthy at all. If the bios is infected, tails cannot help.

I had a conference call with the EFF to discuss SOPA/E-PARASITE. The result is this blog post, threatens-whistleblowing-and-human-rights. If the text of SOPA sounds familiar, it's probably a copy of what is going on in China to justify their continuing clampdown on the Internet, Generally, Tor works on technology. Technology may always be able to circumvent policy, but if something is made illegal, then only criminals benefit. We'd rather spend our money on making Tor better for all of the positive uses of it, not fighting lawsuits and waging policy battles. However, sometimes we have to speak up and help those that do engage in lawsuits and policy battles, like the EFF.
If you don't like the EFF, then Fight for the Future is another fine organization,   If you don't like either of these, then directly calling your congressperson is a fine step too.
We're going to keep working on making Tor better.

There's nothing in the chron.com report, nor that site, that ties Tor
usage to the targeted/killed people. Using a hidden service may help protect both the site and users.
I talked to a journalist from a newspaper in Mexico City concerned about
journalist safety in light of the ongoing drug wars. Most of the
discussion was about how internet surveillance can happen and things
people can do to stay safe, even if they aren't reporting on the drug
There was another journalist from an activist organization with the same
sorts of questions.
In both cases, the bulk of the discussion wasn't around the technology,
but about the social aspects of anonymity. If you use tor to successfully
hide from an adversary who runs the ISP, but login to facebook and join
an anti-zeta group under your real name and profile, well, you've lost
your anonymity.
I mentioned  specifically
 as examples of
places to learn more about blogging/reporting in dangerous areas. CPJ
also has a guide to reporting in dangerous places,
 This violence against journalists (both citizen and traditional) is
nothing new for lots of places in the world. It seems American's aren't
used to seeing it this close to our borders,
Tor alone cannot save you in completely hostile situations. Understanding
the environment and making decisions on your own is key. Many people are
struggling with the understanding part due to being overwhelmed with
the technical knowledge required to stay completely safe online, yet
still live in a hostile area. The lack of understanding leads to poor or
uninformed decisions. No software is going to solve some of these issues.
From talking to DEA agents and former drug/gang members, the drug cartels
are just as advanced as the police forces, if not more so.  We're seeing
the results of this in the targeted killings based on online activities.

: Either way your name is not attached to it, and your home address,

It's trivial for law enforcement to make the one hop from your company
to you and then to your house. Stupid criminals use a front company all
the time. While this may provide some legal protection after you're
raided and talking to a lawyer, you still get the swat team if your
local police are prone to overreaction. : The list may not appreciate my criticism, but the reality is we get

So what? Just because there are overzealous police forces doesn't
mean running a Tor relay isn't legal and not your right to use the
banwidth for which you pay monthly. The vast majority of people
will never experience the exception to the rule; the SWAT team at 5
AM.  is
my experience. This is still the case four years later.
One raided relay out of 3000 relays every six months is a fantastic
ratio. I wish it were zero, but running Tor is not illegal, nor
is relaying traffic for others. The vast majority of Tor traffic is
benign, normal traffic from people who need Tor. I'm going to trust the
probability that says I'm very unlikely to get raided for a Tor exit
node at home.
We also have the start of a legal directory for relay operators,
 At
the worst, call me, I'll try to help. I've helped many over the past
few years, some of them as the police were in the house asking
