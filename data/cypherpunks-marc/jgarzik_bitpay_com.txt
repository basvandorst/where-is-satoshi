One participant, yes.  Two participants lacking net would require a
serious revisit of BIP 70's security assumptions and some design, at a

Let's not pull out silly examples.  Of course you can find locations
that lack Internet.
Those locations are completely unsuitable to bitcoin transactions,
since the receiver cannot verify double-spending or anything else
about the transaction.

It really depends on the physical, real world size of the QR code.
If you have a big screen, and security permits displaying a larger QR
code, you can afford more bytes.  If you are displaying a tiny postage
stamp 1-2cm in size, the practical byte limit is very low.
Ideally, you test your QR codes in real world conditions, before
picking the best path.

Extremely limited.  Preferably under 100 bytes.  You will see
increasingly poor operating in varying light conditions, such as
paying via QR code on a printed receipt in a pub at night.  That was
one of the motivations for BIP 73.

Yes.  Internet connectivity is not a rarity these days.  Near-field
web servers also work fine.
