Anyone happen to know if panix.com had their registrar-lock set
when this happened?

I originally replied offlist, but...
Under the new ICANN transfer policy, this will most likely be
reversed if its shown to be an improper transfer. You need to
bring Dotster into this and they need to invoke a transfer dispute
under the new policy.
MelbourneIT needs to demonstrate a proper FOA (Form of Authorization)
to have initiated the transfer and if its found to be invalid the
domain will be re-instated and Melbourne-IT fined.
