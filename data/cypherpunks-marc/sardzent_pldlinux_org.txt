PLD is the biggest non profit Linux distro, and one of the most active
projects (
We was wondering is it possible do add to yours project home page
( link direct to rpm or
to dir with RPMS compiled and included in our distro.
If so there are links:
  to RPMS dir:
and direct to RPM:
for example.
We know that it's uncomfortable to manualy edit webpage every time new rpm  is been relased and we are working
on some script. Soon it will be finished:)
If it's needed we can send short info about our distro (right now
server  is down  but this
link was and will be used as official distro web page).
Yours sincerely Daniel
