A professor was giving a big test one day to his students. He handed out
all of the tests and went back to his desk to wait. Once the test was over
the students all handed the tests back in. The professor noticed that one of
the students had attached a $100 bill to his test with a note saying "A
dollar per  point." The next class the professor handed the tests back out.
This student got back his test and $64 change.
Two men, John and Jim, traveling through the country in America, stopped at
a small inn for dinner. On the table there was a large cup of mustard.
Thinking the contents were custard or a sweet of some kind, Jim took a
spoonful of it and put it in his mouth. Tears ran down his cheeks, but
wishing to have his friend John caught in the same trap, he said nothing of
the mistake he had made. The other man, seeing that his friend was crying,
said: "Listen, Jim, what are crying about?" "I was thinking of my father who
was hanged twenty years ago," Jim replied. Soon after, John took a spoonful
of the mustard, and as the tears started down his cheeks, Jim in his turn
said "What are you crying about?" "To think you were not hanged the same day
your father was." came the answer.
