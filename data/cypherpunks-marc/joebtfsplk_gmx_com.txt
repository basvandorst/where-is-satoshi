Very interesting, Michael.  You were a part of it (or knew of it) & it was because govt intelligence (you are aware many - not me - call that an oxy moron:)) wanted a system they could use for various purposes, where the source & destination can't be determined by one of the mid points?
That does make sense.  BTW, I never said conspiracy - others did.  Besides, many use the word or concept incorrectly.  A govt developing technology to use in defending the country isn't a conspiracy.  Covering up illegal activities, for instance, would be a conspiracy (like Watergate).  If some govt has figured out how to "decode" Tor traffic (or use it to great advantage) to thwart terrorists, that's not conspiracy.
I'm going out on a limb to say that US intelligence does not believe Tor gives terrorists a great advantage - for what ever reason(s), or else they'd shut it down, or at least stop funding it.  But then, we & other countries continue supplying arms to groups in various conflicts, which they often shoot back at us.   That said, it may be an earlier poster's comment about lack of foresight may apply.  It would seem that enemies *might* benefit from it as much as govts, unless govts are capable of more than many think they are.  No one, except people w/ high level clearance (perhaps various countries) knows the full answer to that, and they're not talking.
They thought the A-bomb was a good idea & no other country would get the technology.  Huh.  I was on the fence on that one.
It *may* be much like other ideas, such as the famous introduction of cats to an island, where they had no natural enemies.  It almost destroyed the island's eco system.
For "what did you think might happen" sorts of things that individuals & govts do, I now reference them as "Introducing Cats to an Island" principles.  Ideas that sound good at 1st, except for forgetting to ask (and seriously ponder) the most important question of all, "What's the worst that can happen if we..."
"Hey, let's build nuclear reactors on major fault lines all over the world."  "Yeah, that sounds good."

No idea why funding from one source is an issue.  Not a requirement for an organization or project to do well or go south.
Some of Watson's, Gregory's & Kasimir's possible explanations are at least plausible.  They may not be correct, but who's to say - & they didn't require conspiracy.
I'm not quite as naive as some seem to think.  When I refer to "govt(s)", I mean which ever dept(s) are involved in a specific endeavor.  Even diff depts involved in same project may not agree.  That's weakly related to my question.
The point about supporting the Taliban is well taken.  That's happened many times.  So are several others - like govts in general, making bad One of my main questions was about, if Tor is * indeed * anonymous to govts in general, it is one of the most powerful tools for terrorist groups (not nations).  Now, if one wants to argue that govt agencies being able to communicate w/ whomever outweighs terrorist groups being able to communicate openly, constantly, w/o fear of intercepted info - how can I argue?   I'm not sure  most advanced countries are that stupid.  Don't know the answer, but know there's usually more than meets the eye.
Doesn't matter who ALL funds Tor (or any project); what matters is who is / can do what w/ the technology or info.  It's great lots of people fund it, but doesn't prove anything one way or other.
Saying that there's a possibility govtS know (or can do) more about intercepting ANY kind of anonymous communications than the developers, universities, private researchers THINK that govts know, is no more a conspiracy theory than the (now) fact that individuals or depts working on the A bomb did not know what the other depts were doing, or how it would all fit together.  That was for the purpose of national security.  They would be the same w/ Tor or anything other technology - protect the national security.
To say the same thing as in WWII hasn't repeatedly happened or won't continue to, is naive - for Tor or anything else.  I DON'T KNOW if ANY govt, anywhere can intercept Tor communications.  *If*  they could, I know no govt(s) agencies or developers would be allowed to say so.  Like I said, it's a hard sell.  People are still waiting for WMDs to be found "over there," because that's what they were told.

Please, please - everyone (probably including me) is making the topic  way more complicated than my main question.  No one's addressed the main question.  If there's no answer, that's fine.  Forget conspiracy theories.  If you have a plausible, possible explanation to one question, great.
Why would any govt create something their enemies can easily use against them, then continue funding it once they know it helps the enemy, if a govt has absolutely no control over it?  It's that simple.  It would seem a very bad idea.  Stop looking at it from a conspiracy standpoint & consider it as a common sense question.
Number 1 & 3 on your list are either fact or common knowledge.
# 2 - I didn't say govts ONLY act out of self interest.
# 4 is very likely for large govts - espec. for something like  (electronically) monitoring internet traffic / email, listening to phone calls.  These actions are well documented in several countries.  It's not conspiracy - was well documented & investigated by US Congress & covered in documentaries.  Fact, not conspiracy.  How does that behavior relate to Tor?  Don't know - that's the question.

I appreciate your comments & the work of all involved w/ Tor.  I read the papers you linked, though I've seen most of the material in various Perhaps you should, because at least one govt seems to be steering the boat.  Therein lies the problem (not you, specifically).  My comments & MAINLY questions, weren't about typical or even very sophisticated adversaries.  They concern WHY any govt would continue funding an anonymous communication project that in today's world, very real enemies can use against said govt, in a very real way, if the govt has no way to monitor it?  One should ask, "Why would they do that?"  It doesn't make sense unless there's more to the story.  Also, in terms of adversaries against something like Tor, any advanced, well funded govt dwarfs the most sophisticated adversaries.  Many govts have unimaginable technology & resources as well as legal (or not so legal) authority to demand info (from ISPs, etc.) that no typical adversary would.
The threat models, discussion of thwarting various attacks, safety in numbers, etc., are all based on assumptions like, 1) the adversaries don't have unlimited time, resources & $.  That assumption is out the window if an adversary is a large govt.
2) The adversary doesn't have access to (some) info going IN and OUT of a network like Tor.  Not valid for a govt.  They can get what they want from ISPs - and have.  The info may be encrypted going in, but they can see you're accessing a Tor node.  A large govt could ALSO monitor every single exit node (& may).
There's NO comparison between people looking at open code, universities or organizations doing small studies on flaws in Tor, etc., and capabilities of a large, advanced govt.  So please, I'm not talking about how many people or universities look at Tor.
Advanced govts no doubt have incredible technology regarding breaking encryption.  Not a typical adversary.  Since Tor was developed BY a govt, and since many talk about one of its greatest values is to allow people in "repressed" societies to communicate freely, the adversary those users need to be most concerned about, is probably the one MOST likely to breach Tor's anonymity.  I doubt most people think Tor's main purpose is to hide communication between two cheating spouses.
A govt helped develop Tor for SPECIFIC reasons (we probably don't know all of them) & still funds it.  Then for users around the world counting on Tor for protection from their govts, the govts would have to be considered as one of the main adversaries to Tor.  Either the US is really dumb for developing a system, perfect for enemies to use against them (kinda doubt that) or there's more to the story.
I don't pretend to know the answers, but know when to ask questions.  For all I know, the US wants the enemy to use Tor for plotting, thinking they're anonymous, when they're not.  No one's answering my specific questions, possibly because if they knew them, they'd be in top level govt positions, sworn to secrecy.  For those doubting any of this has any merit, are you still waiting for them to find WMDs in Iraq?

1st, a note.  I appreciate everyone's reply.  If some want to be a bit insulting or sarcastic, that's OK.  I'm not highly technically savvy in source code, but I've lived a long time & know a lot about typical modus operandi of many govts.   I've read all up thru Klaus Layer's post.
2nd, my reference to a TRUE back door in open source software was fairly tongue in cheek.  However, * software is only part of the the Tor system.*  Responders are assuming I meant the ONLY way * any * govt could "crack" Tor is thru the software itself (or a back door, etc.).  That's not what I meant at all - sorry if I gave that impression.  There are lots of exit nodes, for * one * instance.  There's lots of eaves dropping on exit nodes.  There are probably ways inconceivable to most, how govts could get info from Tor communication.  Tell me this:  what other form of communication is off limits anymore in many counties, that govts monitor (constitutionally or not)?  I am NOT anti-govt, nor am I completely blind.
Axiom (or should be):  advanced governments have far more technological ability & capability than 1) anyone knows; 2) the govtS (not just ONE ) will EVER reveal; 3) than any university, institution or other very smart individual or group will necessarily be able to detect, or certainly prove.  Most of these are probably in the best interest of However, I feel comfortable saying, those thinking they know exactly what govts are / are not technologically capable of, are deceiving themselves.  They call them "Top Secrets" for a reason.
Fact:  Even if someone discovered any govt successfully monitoring something like Tor, if they CHOOSE to, most any govt can shut down "whistle blowers," university / private research, etc., on anything they consider of national security, in an instant.
Maybe, but I'm asking why any govt would create a system that it can't control, that could be used by its enemies to do as much or more damage, as the good the govt gets from it?  That's one HUGE problem w/ the concept that DoD / NRL created or continues funding anything * like * Tor (not JUST Tor).  If they truly have no way of figuring out who's using a communication method, what users are saying or any other means of identifying something about (Tor) users , they have created & still funding a WEAPON for the enemy to use against them.  Can't help wondering about that.
You can't have it both ways.  Either they can't & enemies are using it (or similar) to plot against MANY govts, or they can & users in "free" countries don't have nearly the privacy they think.  Is the DoD / NRL that stupid?  Possibly - don't know.  But if those saying it is basically impossible for any govt to get useful info from Tor communication are indeed correct, it defies logic any govt would do such a thing.  Or is it that they shortsightedly created something they thought would only benefit them, & now the enemy is using it against us?  Pandora's box is open?
One or 2... poorly researched?  Over several yrs, I think there're numerous reputable instances of serious flaws discovered in Tor.  Sure, they're patched when announced & confirmed.  I'm also sure it will be an ongoing problem, hence part of my concern.
Paul, it's NOT just the software - I'm sure that's regularly, independently examined.  ONE thing no one knows, for instance, is what capability govts have once communication leaves exit nodes.  Advanced govts aren't prone to shooting themselves in the foot.  What some are indicating or at least intimating here, is the US created something (maybe unintentionally) the enemy can NOW use against many countries AND they are still funding it.  Does that make sense?  Not to me - w/o some reasonable facts, such as why enemies can't use it against govts.

1st, thanks for the refresher, Paul.  I'll bet most users didn't know Tor was started by the NRL.  Unfortunately, for many, that won't ease their minds much.
I don't have the knowledge & skills to check Tor's source code & bet well > 90% of users don't either.
I know (knew) my comments on Tor being funded (or started) by any Fed organization would not be well received.  Neither were the handful of people w/ inside knowledge after 9-11 attacks, shouting there was no justification in attacking Iraq.  They were shouted down & quickly labeled as unpatriotic.  Even today, surveys show a significant percent of people still believe Iraq was responsible for 9-11 attacks.  "Don't confuse me w/ facts - I've already made up my mind."
Again, WHY would Sam develop or fund technology that would make it possible for * their enemies *  to communicate anonymously and privately, possibly allowing them to plot against him, with ABSOLUTELY no way to decipher that communication?
It's a serious question.  Please save the "check the source code yourself" comments.  Open source code means literally nothing.  Did it mean anything when Iraq cracked down on Tor users?  Researchers often show that.  What makes this project different than other govt funded projects?  (This seems like the, "It'll never happen here / to us" It * IS * happening to us in pretty much every aspect of citizens' privacy.  That's no secret.  What makes Tor any different?   If one govt can figure out how to identify Tor traffic, so can others.  Above ALL else, govts NEVER reveal the full extent of their intelligence capability.  That would be foolish.
I've never known Sam to get involved in, or fund something - especially like this - * w/o wanting something in return.*  Ever.  WHETHER or not they make known, to anyone, what they want or intend to do.  It's been shown for over 50 - 60 yrs (probably much longer) that even people in charge of entire govt projects (or govt funded ones), often don't know the  *full* extent of what's being done w/ the research, technology, info, etc.  If you want to ignore history, go ahead.

You've GOT to be kidding.  Tell me that's a mistake.  Tor Project, dedicated to privacy & anonymity, takes $ from DoD & Sam?  While the US spies on it's citizens, unconstitutionally?  That's rich.
Honestly, this enlightenment will make me reconsider ever using Tor for anything I don't want sent directly to DC.  It's like trusting car magazines' reviews that get their advertising $ from car manufacturers.  There is no way the fed is going to give $ to any "privacy" organization w/o wanting something (cough, back door) in return.  Every ISP has been forced into violating users' privacy.  Why would Tor project, after taking $ from Sam, be any different?  OK users, go ahead & stick your head in the sand.
EVEN if it's not true, for me, Tor project has lost a good deal of its credibility through its associations.  Of course, no government would ever lie & neither would a company (AT&T, Ford, Google, R.J. Reynolds...).

Thanks Anne.  Laws in virtually every state (U.S.) & country are different - yes?
I think I understand what you said, but not sure why it'd be so (in U.S.)  In a situation that LEAs SAY they suspect a crime, one's personal data (say, credit card info / transactions) stored on "3rd party servers" - (say, Amazon.com) is not protected in any shape form or fashion, from Boss Hogg (aka, an LEA) saying, Amazon - I want Daisy Duke's credit card info.  I don't have a warrant, but give it to me, anyway.  And Amazon has to say, "Sure,"... because of why??
Any business like that storing info would be a 3rd party server - yes?  So no LEA would ever need warrants to get financial / purchase transactions, email, ISP browsing records - ad nauseum,  Habeas Corpus, defacto, oreo.  Because it's your info, NOT stored on your personal equipment.  Is that correct?
Doctors storing patients' medical info, for back up purposes, off site, would be storing it on a 3rd party server.  So, does it become public Or at least Deputy Fife could walk into the back up storage facility & say, I want medical records on a guy that's been sniffing around Thelma Lou, cause he ran a stop sign.  And they must give it to him w/o a warrant?  I think we must have skipped over a few details.

I think I understand your point, but if Tor (or anything else) isn't really anonymous, there's no point in advertising it as anonymous. Unless you're selling snake oil.  If gov'ts (or other groups) can get what they want, when they want, out of an ISP, exit relays, etc., then it's only anonymous as long as no one's interested in what you're saying or doing.  Meaning, it's not really anonymous at all.
If being anonymous, or more specifically, having anonymous communication is outlawed (& it almost is, in practice), then there will be no Tor.
The conundrum:  if every thing that has some useful purpose is outlawed because someone can also use it maliciously, or LEAs make so no one wants to touch it, then most everything could be be banned - by that line of thinking.
gasoline - gone.
2" x 4" lumber - can be used as weapon - gone.
baby diapers - can be used to smother someone - gone.
kitchen or butcher knives injure / kill thousands around the world each year?  They're not trying to outlaw knives over 5 inches, because they pose no threat to a gov't.
Bottom line is, no gov'ts want their law abiding or criminal citizens to communicate anonymously, because it takes away power. Yes, they want to catch criminals (& we want them to).  No, they're not concerned in the least if 90 - 99% (or what ever) of Tor users don't break the law.  If they catch criminals AND stop people from using Tor, running exits - out of fear, they killed 2 birds w/ one stone.
The internet is really the best thing invented to allow gov'ts of the world to keep tabs on all citizens ( though they say they're only after criminals).  When people still wrote letters, (most) gov'ts couldn't scan EVERY letter, just to see what popped up.

I forgot - did someone say they keep cash & extra phone in a safe deposit box (pre paid or contract?  Contract phone is no use in a police crack down)?
If a deposit box, judge could freeze that too, so better hide it in someone else's house.  And what are they gonna say about that?  "I need to hide a phone, money, gun, etc. in your basement."
Even though I might think some of it's vaguely similar to preparing for a hurricane, most of my family would have me committed.
Though I empathize w/ him (read below), if William hasn't been charged w/ ANY thing, there's not much need for a full legal team - just yet.  Sure, he's sweating bullets - innocent or not.  But that doesn't translate into spending huge $ right now.  An attorney can't do anything (if he's truly innocent) unless there are at least some charges to start thinking about a defense; they arrest him, etc.
Unless William's goal is to get his equip back quickly.  A lawyer could file motions, but probably wouldn't do much good - at least for now.  It does appear that one in his situation would be building a defense fund before there is anything to defend against.  Now, if he could promise to pay everyone back, proportionally, for what wasn't used for defense... but how could one do that?  How would we make them, if they decided not to?
What if the defense fund is needed because he actually did something illegal (not necessarily porn)?  I agree, that in these VERY beginning stages, a guy w/ the credentials he's presented, should have the means to pay an attorney for an hr or 2, to tell him what to do / not to do, until such time that he's arrested, charges are filed, etc., (if ever).  Right now, that's all  he needs.
*How do I know?*  Cause I was put in a similar situation - of the *possibility* I might have to defend myself against false charges - unrelated to issues in this case.  I got basic advice on what to do / not do for now; have cash for bail bond, in unlikely event I was arrested.  (Believe me, they could've arrested me & asked questions later).  Then, nothing to do but wait... and wait.  Nerve racking.  Lost bunch of weight when needed to gain some.  But, didn't need bunch of money.
I didn't have equipment or belongings seized, but police never "told" me anything later on, like, "We're not filing charges;" "the DA isn't referring this to a Grand Jury."  Nothing, nada.  No, "Sorry we came to your house w/ no justification & threatened you."  No arresting the other person that made false accusations, even though there were witnesses.  Even then, I only needed a lawyer to advise me of basic rights, of prudent behavior till something did / did not develop, etc.  No giant defense fund needed.  The whole thing just... disappeared.
How much is 10,000 EU anyway - $100 USD?
There's a reason I'd never run a Tor exit or probably relay.  I'd like to.  If raided, I could never take the stress.  Too old now, w/ chronic health issues.  Plus I wouldn't want to spend my retirement savings hiring lawyers, if things got really ugly.
And people call me paranoid...

I read the paper - good job. Some of it will be over the heads of some, but that's unavoidable unless make it 10+ pages, in newbie language, then few would read it all, so...
I'm not bashing Tor here, so leave your pitchforks in the barn. Just asking questions, making observations that may / may not have an answer or even be useful.
One thing jumps out, Tor doesn't know for sure who's running Guard or exit nodes - & can't unless they start doing (regular, repeated) extensive personal interviews, background checks, giving polygraph tests, injecting sodium pentathol  to those wanting to run nodes.  I guess more so for Guards.
Since apparently now LEAs from (some) countries are teaming up, sharing info, etc., seems possible the problem of LEAs (or any adversaries) running a higher % of nodes could get worse, not better.  If adversary nodes as a % of all nodes doesn't increase (new good guy nodes keeps up w/ increase of adversarial ones), then overall risk hasn't changed.  But how can Tor (or any group) determine the risk if they have no reasonably reliable way to determine the REAL intention / identity of node operators (spies infiltrating Tor Network)?
Governments, crooks have proven themselves VERY resourceful over decades, or 100's of yrs.  The U.S., let alone other industrialized nations partnering together, has a lot more manpower, resources & money than Tor Project.  I don't think we can out spend "them," for setting up nodes.  How many full / part time programmers or "idea people" does Tor have (as good as they are) VS. one agency of one industrialized nation?
Is there any way - in the future, that Tor could run a much larger % of nodes or at least, instead of constantly trying to figure how to "beat / drastically improve the odds" that an adversary won't accidentally control the entry / exit nodes on circuits?  Perhaps a noble, but losing game, if gov'ts band together & decide Tor, or the entire internet, IS worth serious monitoring.  Perhaps reasonable anonymity on a world wide party line is too ambitious? (Those that don't know what a "telephone party line" was, can "Startpage it."  [stop saying "Google it"] :)
What about somehow getting a better handle on who actually runs the nodes?  With its current policies & design, Tor is in a very tough position to "ensure quality" (anonymity).  Tor isn't supposed to see any real data on the network - for one, so they can't be forced to give anything up (again, noble), but that prevents some (a lot of?) capability for quality control.  No company would / could handle its own security that way.  It's a Catch 22 situation for Tor, because of legal threats that many gov'ts impose, that many corporations don't face.  And if they had some REALLY secret stuff to send abroad, they'd fly it in their own jet.
What about a COMPLETELY different approach, rather than trying to develop methods to "beat the odds," *ad infinitum,* against what COULD become an ever increasingly larger PERCENTAGE of gov't / adversary run nodes?  Surely, it'd be worthwhile to look way down the road & see where Gov'ts / LEAs may be going w/ this & whether they can be "bested," by following the same course that Tor is on (even with improvements along the way)?  I have no idea - I'm just saying, sometimes the only way businesses, technologies, gov'ts survive & thrive is to completely change course.   For all of history, gov'ts have gone to GREAT lengths to spy on citizens & adversaries & have often done pretty well at it.
Well liked corporations can often be as secretive as they want - they're "protecting corporate data & assets."  Tor is looked at in part (*by gov'ts & LEAs*), as a tool for terrorists, criminals - of all sorts.  They couldn't care less if honest people, whistle blowers swim near schools of criminals & terrorists, whether some will get caught in the same net.  Maybe, like Corporations that get away w/ figurative murder, Tor Project should start contributing heavily to key political figures, to ensure they'll "be left alone?"  :D
You laugh, but that's exactly why big business, who by current STATUTES, break JUST AS MANY OR MORE laws, as Gov'ts / LEAs *ASSUME* that Tor users do?   Big Business is left alone & entities like Tor are on the hit list.

- heartbleed vulnerability
- type ciphers used

Using SSLlabs.com & some others to confirm findings, I was quickly able to determine that most banks - large & small - already installed the openSSL patch, much earlier on Tues. - possibly on Mon.
Where this smaller bank w/ a fair number of regional branches that I use, still had not upgraded OpenSSL as of midday on Wed 4/9.
The manager / VP in charge of their computer operations didn't reply to my email informing him of the continued problem, until... I sent a follow up to the bank COO, that the problem was still unresolved as of 4/9/14.  Funny how that works.
The followup reminding them both that they were putting themselves & customers at risk; from being so slow to implement the patch compared to comparable businesses, from not warning customers of the issue & by not stopping customers from logging in (potentially exposing passwords & critical data), until sufficient fixes were in place.
This may be a good thing to find out general practices.  They've been slow about past, immediate security issues, which I brought to their attention & they never said, "Sorry," "Get bent," or anything.
Only made excuses for being out of the office.  This could be the final straw for me using them for primary online banking.

UPDATE:  Users should not assume that by now, their bank / other HTTPS sites have patched the OpenSSL software.
Use one of the check sites, to see if a domain / server is still vulnerable to heartbleed bug.
As of late morning, 4/9/14, one of my banks (takes > 1 to hold all my $ :D) still hasn't patched it.
They have no warning on their site about it & apparently aren't restricting user login to access acct info or online bill pay.
They're not cautioning users to be alert for suspicious activity in their acct.

Thanks.  Adding one more heartbleed vulnerability site I tried: It seemed to work (though tough to qualify results).  It came back showing my bank was *still vulnerable* (not surprising).
So, made a payment over the phone instead of using their bill pay system (this should probably be taken this seriously, but some won't).
I checked a few other major sites at the rehmann link - it showed them as OK.
*"So you have to trust they did..."*
When something like this comes along, you shouldn't ASS-U-ME anything, or your ass may regret it. :)
Hard to imagine any reasonably large financial instit. NOT having a prominent banner on all main pages,
"We have (have not) fixed the openSSL issue. Customers can (should not) now do online banking." But not a peep.

Comments / suggestions from those w/ in depth knowledge in this area?  How users should proceed; how to check if sites used (banks, email, retail sites, etc.) were / still are affected, so one knows if & when to change passwords or other data?
If the number of sites potentially affected is as large as indicated on heartbleed.com, changing PW on even 60% of sites I use could take a long time - even to do it once.
It would do little good to change a password on a site that hasn't patched this.
Or perhaps it would do some good, to change the password before logging out of a site?  Then when a site must be accessed again, change the password again.
Either way, this might not provide perfect safety, but might ? be better than nothing.

For general principle, I always thought it was a little strange that Tor changed circuits every 10 minutes.
That it was too predictable, like a patrol car driving by the bank exactly at the beginning of the hour.
Never deviating.
There may not be any current, known exploits of this in Tor, but many things in Tor are built around randomness - for a specific reason.
On the other hand, what about destination sites that have only a few active Tor users at a given time.
Of course, their 10 minute circuits wouldn't have all begun at the same But of the Tor users on that site, if only one users circuits change at a specific time & continue to do so every 10 minutes, does that make them harder or easier to pick out of that specific crowd?

Thanks Zenaan, for detailed reply.
Knowing that this is  only a mailing list - not a Tor or VPN wiki, your diagrams & scenarios further show (to me) how complex these issues are.
In spite of your & some others' excellent attempts, it may be so complex that unless one is already an expert, mailing list answers won't be enough to educate most users.
Meaning, properly educating users  on Tor (TBB) and VPNs - or anything else -  to boost TBB's resistance against more powerful adversaries.
It may be that for now, Tor Project doesn't suggest using anything like

Exactly.  This isn't about agreeing / disagreeing with any group.
Only about what actually works for various, well organized groups to effect political change.
It takes more than a tiny % of any population, doing more than writing "pretty please" letters & wearing slogan Tee shirts.

I'm not, but some would say that LEAs & gov'ts figuring out how to track down people on the internet is no different than the time in societies when LEAs started developing modern crime solving technologies.
Fingerprints, comparing bullet markings & all the modern tools to catch bad guys.
Before that, it was a lot harder to prove a crime w/o eye witnesses, etc.
And societies lost a lot of their privacy because of the new advances.
And we will likely continue to lose them (not looking forward to it).
"Rulers are gonna rule."
Until such time as there are no more humans.
