Okay... so one side says it's 5th amendment rights, the other side says it's just like searching a house.
To point out something clearly obvious: they can search your house, get your blood & do DNA testing, take your stuff away etc without your interaction.
Asking for a password is asking for _information_. It's kind of like asking for your offshore bank account number or something.
Exactly what the 5th amendment right is about, if i'm not mistaken.
On a side note: I have crypt containers lying around on different HD's that I may have not even used, or did - but for benchmarking purposes, or even used it and temporarily and haven't opened it in years... following the court's logic, i'm a criminal if i don't remember the password to them (and i seriously don't). I don't think this is okay.
