You fail to understand that society is not comprised
only by rational actors and is more complex than a simple
if-else statement. Adding one more thing to spread fear
and death is redundant. On a massive scale this ends up
being at best a PR disaster for the people backing it up.
Besides, you already have general prediction markets already
out there working like Augur as I mentioned earlier.
What are your thoughts on that?

I will disagree with you here. Craig may be an idiot and
the fact that he holds patents makes him dangerous but he
does not have the network effect that the BCH "community" has.
They are all over the place when it comes to fake
libertarianism. I attended Anarchapulco last February, these
guys are FAR MORE DANGEROUS than Faketoshi. Both of these
shitcoins are meant to go down.

FYI I don't give a flying fuck about BSV and I consider
Faketoshi an idiot and dangerous scammer but I really
enjoyed this guy's breakdown of the BCH problems that
were made apparent after the split. Instead of making
assumptions, you could just ask.

Also, it wasn't clear from a quick look, do they utilize I2P at the network=

dard primes. The use of ElGamal is so pervasive throughout the I2P protocol=
 stack that it exists at every level of it. Removing it is a massive task t=
hat is taking a long
LONG time.
I am not a crypto expert but really how bad is ElGamal 2048bit that you can=
not wait for it to change? It's still the default in gpg fwiw. What did you=
 choose instead and what did Loki gain out of it in terms of performance?
 network architecture. Recently I2P has added some blocklist solutions sign=
ed by release signers but this probably won't scale in the event of a "big"=
 attack.
What about a mix of staking and DDoSing existing Service Nodes out of the n=
etwork? At a large scale such an attack would be far more effective than tr=
ying to out-stake the network.
Is Loki staffed for such attacks?
