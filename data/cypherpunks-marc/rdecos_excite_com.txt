I saw your email on a website I visited yesterday, and thought
you might be interested in this.
A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.
The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
Anyway, near the end of March I received a letter from my
sponsor (Leslynne Perry) informing me that I had more than 2000
PAID members in my downline!
As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?
I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Leslynne asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)
Well, it was true...I had 2865 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!
All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2865 people.
You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!
I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!
With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS.
My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.
How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your downline grow?
