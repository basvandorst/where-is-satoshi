@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Payment Protocol for Face-to-face Payments 
If the only concern is to make scan-to-pay work without reliance on
SSL's PKI, it might be better to specify the payment protocol url
*and* the public key used for signing right in the qr code. The wallet
connects to the url, fetches the payment request (maybe over a secure
connection, maybe not, doesn't matter), and verifies the signature
matches the public key from the qr code.
Downsides compared to embedding the entire request:
Payee needs to host/serve requests somewhere online. This introduces
reliability and DoS concerns.
Payer needs an internet connection to fetch the request.
Serve variable payment requests from the same qr code (improving
recipient privacy).
Still no hard dependency on CAs. Even if both CA and DNS are
compromised by an attacker, the worst they can do is Denial of
Optionally use CAs so that the wallet can attach an identity to who
you're paying by QR code. This partly addresses the problem of the
waiter overwriting the QR code. A non-PKI transaction would simply
show "Unknown recipient".
Much smaller QR code (only overhead is the key parameter, and you
could use a boolean param + the "address as public key" hack Mike
mentionned, for only 4 characters of overhead).
No need for a backward-incompatible bitcoin: scheme
