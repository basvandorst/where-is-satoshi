Blunder puts FBI suspects on internet
"A CONFIDENTIAL FBI list of 370 people suspected of
helping Osama bin Laden's terrorist network has
leaked out.
The names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail,
and social security codes of the suspects were
posted on the internet by Finland's Financial
Supervision Authority (RATA)."
