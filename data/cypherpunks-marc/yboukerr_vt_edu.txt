@_subject: Re: [cryptography] urandom vs random 
In terms of usability engineering, /dev/random is fairly cumbersome and in dire need of reform and expansion.
A user, might want more control of /dev/random - which sources of entropy, when, and which applications. e.g. I want my Geiger counter to feed communications and radio noise to feed data. I want 3000 from 9am-5pm and 200 otherwise. I want all this'd in a GUI or config file.
A developer, might want to tell /dev/random "don't give me keyboard and mouse crap, instead give me 80% rdrand and 20% audio source."
Naturally, the better alternative is a widely implemented open sources TRNG, but good luck convincing manufacturers. So why concentrate on what you can't fix. Reform /dev/random and empower user and developer with choice over quality and amount of randomness!
Randomness is hard to prove but you can test quality with dierharder.
