Delphi Forums Member Update
     We are pleased to update you with the progress we've been making here at Delphi Forums. The following is
 a list of past issues that have either been resolved or for which we are making great progress:
Its here! Fresh out of beta testing, our new three-tier system, including DelphiPlus, DelphiAdvanced, and DelphiBasic, is nearly ready for release. DelphiPlus includes several new features and benefits and costs just $4.95 per month. DelphiAdvanced is just $1.29 per month and includes exist
ing Delphi Forums functionality, no advertising, access to Delphi University courses, and unlimited listening privileges on DelphiCast. DelphiBasic is our free service and provides simple functionality and access.
The number one request by the Delphi
 community has been for a world-class, reliable chat product. We worked for some time to fix our existing chat and made the determination to build an entirely new version. Our new chat system has been in beta testing for several weeks and is nearly ready
 for release. We believe it is the finest chat product on the market. It is stable, robust, and feature rich. You will notice no difference in function other than improved speed and reliability. Have fun; Delphi chat is a remarkable experience.
After a bumpy start, eGems is now run
ning and downloading flawlessly and is available FREE to DelphiPlus members. Become a DelphiPlus member now and experience this award-winning product.

New courses are currently in developme
nt. Courses in Finance, Human Relations, and Health and Nutrition will be released first. Courses will include discussions, FREE Quick Courses and chat (for DelphiPlus and DelphiAdvanced members), as well as interactive scheduled courses with instructors
 and students. DelphiPlus and DelphiAdvanced members will also enjoy FREE live broadcasts by world-renowned experts, guests, and celebrities. Get ready for DelphiU!

 better help Delphi Forums' lifeblood, our forum hosts, we are starting a new forum dedicated to assisting Hosts.  This forum will replace Forumoperator.  The new Hosts forum will open on June 17, 2002.  The address is  or for more information, click here.
