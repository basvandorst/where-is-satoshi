@_subject: [cryptography] Dual_EC_DRBG was cooked, but not AES? 
The Snowden revelations describe several methods by which NSA committed kle=
ptography, caused compliance by hardware makers and influenced standards. =
Why has AES escaped general suspicion? Are we to believe that NIST tested, =
selected, endorsed and promulgated an algorithm that was immune to NSA's to=
olset, without NSA participation and approval? NSA involvement in DES is kn=
own, but we await cryptanalysis or Snowdenesque revelations before having s=
kepticism about AES?
"On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the Federal Register. =
Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshop=
s were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was some criticism from=
 various parties, including from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin He=
llman and Whitfield Diffie,[2] citing a shortened key length and the myster=
ious "S-boxes" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspi=
cion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence =
agency so that they =97 but no-one else =97 could easily read encrypted mes=
sages.[3] Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, "We sent th=
e S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different."[4] The=
 United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed the NSA's a=
ctions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the=
 unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee w=
In the development of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced key size was su=
fficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; a=
nd certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowled=
ge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.[5]
However, it also found that
NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invente=
d and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, an=
d concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all co=
mmercial applications for which the DES was intended.[6]"

 by a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward Snowden, suggest that the N.S.A. gen=
erated one of the random number generators used in a 2006 N.I.S.T. standard=

 NSA." On September 10 2013, The NIST director released a statement, saying=
 that "NIST would not deliberately weaken a cryptographic standard.""

 to stop using an encryption system that relies on a mathematical formula d=
eveloped by the National Security Agency (NSA).
RSA, the security arm of the storage company EMC, sent an email to customer=

velopers used a weak formula, and they should switch to one of the other fo=
rmulas in the product.
The abrupt warning is the latest fallout from the huge intelligence disclos=
ures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden about the extent of surveillance a=
nd the debasement of encryption by the NSA.
Last week, the New York Times reported that Snowden's cache of documents fr=
om his time working for an NSA contractor showed that the agency used its p=
ublic participation in the process for setting voluntary cryptography stand=
ards, run by the government's National Institute of Standards (NIST) and Te=
chnology, to push for a formula it knew it could break. Soon after that rev=
elation, the NIST began advising against the use of one of its cryptographi=
c standards and, having accepted the NSA proposal in 2006 as one of four sy=
stems acceptable for government use, said it would reconsider that inclusio=
n in the wake of questions about its security."

For reflection: What percent of domestic and global communications are protected from the collection of plaintext or session information by AES?
Who has the capability and the desire to avoid going dark on that portion of data flows? Is this an example of a high-value target for corruption? If the promulgation of a flawed Dual_EC_DRBG was influenced, tolerated or supported by NIST and/or NSA in 2006, can we be sure that AES (FIPS PUB 197, 2001) was immune to those behaviors?
If it was immune, was that due to a lack of funding, a lack of will, or a lack of technical acumen?
