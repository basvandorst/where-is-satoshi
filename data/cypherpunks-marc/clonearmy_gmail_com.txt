There already are options on bitcoins.  [1] nominally
supports them in its order book, though I see little use so far [2].
Apparently someone wrote a put for 100BTC at a strike price of
$0.75/BTC with a 1.50BTC premium two months ago, maturing 31 May 2011
[3]; the option did in fact sell but I have no idea whether it was
exercised. Bitcoin calls have been around on the forum since at least
January [4], complete with risk reversal strategies ([5] is a textbook
example of a collar though not a zero-premium one).

Those bullet points are far more likely to be brought up at trial than any
of the security properties of OTR. Defense counsel has to weigh the benefits
of presenting evidence -- will it get some point across, or will it be lost
on the judge/jury?
I submit that a military judge or a panel of commissioned officers (and
maybe some enlisted personnel) is unlikely to appreciate the finer
mathematical points, and more likely to fall back on "but there are these
logs, right there, and the feds say they're authentic." The defense has
plenty of Lamo's own documented actions to use to undermine his credibility.
There's much to be said for "baffle them with bullshit" (not that there's
necessarily any bullshit even involved), but a jury that doesn't understand
an argument is likely to dismiss it as bullshit.
