FINDING QUICKER SOLUTIONS AND SOLVING   PROBLEMS QUICKER
When you are fully booked and
overloaded   with work there are still the possibility to use the ancient mental   working methods, used by successful people, instead of the risk for   stress and burn out problems.
These ancient methods for shortening   waiting time, adding power to a quicker decision, eliminating stress and
the   risk for burn out, are not so commonly used, despite the methods are   known from ancient time.
The power in the mental working
methods   claim for no extra energy consumption so the body will not get tired,
stressed   or burn out.
Please check the web
In the compendium I, the
undersigned, will   reveile and explain my own methods - how I learned them and how I am
training   and exercizing them as well as the tactics in converting inner knowledge
to   outer reality the speediest way ever known.
You are most wellcome to study these   methods.
Best regards
