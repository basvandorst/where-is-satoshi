While not arguing the specifics of the socioeconomic situation in India,
remember that per capita income is only half the equation.
Cost of living is the other half of the equation.
Within the U.S., cost of living varies widely between cities.  See:

Out of a population of 900 million (or so) that's definitly the wings of
the bell curve.  The "poverty line" in the US is twice the middle class
income of India.  That's pretty stunning.
In the US, anyone below $20,000/yr income is "poor".  According
to that, 90% of India is "dirt poor"!!
