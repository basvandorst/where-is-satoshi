Quoting zem :
Andrey Sverdlichenko is working on encrypted vn support for FreeBSD.  He
currently has a working kernel module that supports Blowfish and AES.  I have
not tested it for suitability as an encrypted swap solution.
This is cryptographic disk driver for FreeBSD. It provides transparent
encryption and decryption of selected devices. It is based on vn(4).

Quoting Jan Dobrucki :
I don't think the threat model justifies your solution.  Locks on
vehicles deter burglary of the vehicle's contents and theft of the
vehicle itself.  As long as automobiles have breakable glass, a lock
will not prevent "smash-and-grabs".  Ford has used simple code keypads
on some of their cars for over 10 years.  How will adding a strong
cipher help prevent break-ins?
Putting a strong cipher on the ignition would be a bit better.  Many
manufacturers use a special key that inlucdes a RFID or a specific
resistor value to enable the ignition.  However, this system can be
bypassed by replacing the unit that reads the key with a previously
stolen/modified unit.  I believe preventing the control unit from being
replaced would be the primary problem you would need to solve.
