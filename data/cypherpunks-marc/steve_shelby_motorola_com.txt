I would install Sun's JRE from java.sun.com, or if you have an older version, uninstall it and install the newer one.
Also be sure to patch up from windowsupdate.microsoft.com

I have posted this mail to the list at least twice in the past month and no   one has made an attempt to answer it. I get this when I click on file manager.   Can someone PLEASE help? Is no one else getting this error? I am getting this error - java.lang.ClassFormatError: FileManager (bad   magic number). Does anyone know what it means and how to fix it?
