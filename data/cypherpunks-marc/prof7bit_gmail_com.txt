No, these few string replaces do not waste any time or resources, this
claim is totally ridiculous.
The protocol is self documenting, just print the messages to the
console as they are, the commands mean what their names suggest, it is
so simple you can even simulate a complete handshake and chat session
in telnet manually. Not every hype of the day (xml, protobuf,
binary-json, etc) must be used only because it exists and someone
thinks it has a cool sounding name, sometimes a simple line of text is
enough to transmit a simple foo=bar key-value pair without needing to
wrap it into kilobytes of obfuscating bloat.

What is bad about the torchat protocol? Is it its pragmatism and the
fact that it does not use xml and other bloat?
