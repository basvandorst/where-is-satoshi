Why go to all that trouble.  Just take it out of circuit.  Cut the printed circuit
board leads and disable it or if its in an inaccessible black box, cut leads to the box.
Easy enough.

Except its interesting that in the late/ongoing gulf conflict the Catholic church actually
said that US aggression on Iraq was evil.  Interesting.  In any case, my mother who would
consider herself a devout Catholic ignored this control channel and found herself obeying
the other more insidious control channel -- mass media.  They have weapons of
mass destruction.  Tomorrow they could be gassing all of NYC.  blah blah blah.
They have spurned the UN long enough!!!
Nothing about oil companies shutting down Saddam because he was funneling Russian Caspian
sea oil through his pipeline.  The rules say Saddam couldn't pump his own own (except
for oil for food).  They don't say anything about him moving someone else's oil.
