What is your concern when using Truecrypt? Some say the Truecrypt Project has courious licenses, incompatible with the "normal" OSS licenses. This might be a reason not using TrueCrypt. But I have not yet heard that using Truecrypt were a SECURITY risk. So what are the reasons one should not TrueCrypt except the license issues?
BTW: There was a newspaper article in germany some years ago, a police officier was interviewd regarding the "Bundestrojaner". He stated some islamic terrorists who tried blasting a railway have encrypted their hard drive. The german police tried to crack that hard drive but didnt succeed after 2 years. He said that tools like Truecrypt are such strong that there is need to install keylogger, gathering passwords.
So again, is TrueCrypt broken or not?
