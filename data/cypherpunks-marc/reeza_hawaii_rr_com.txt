True as well - until such time as the Nat.Guard is federalized (which

I'm not so sure Bill White is a "red."
But, the web page should say "copyright 2001" eh?
Bill White, the author of the subject-line story, wrote something for Indymedia.org also - it sheds a bit of light on him, perhaps also on
Tim's response to the article.
BILL WHITE: ISRAELI LOBBY SCRAMBLING FOR NEW APPROACH TO CRISIS (PART 1) The following is the first in a two-part series by Bill White. We will feature the second installment tomorrow. As Their Allies In Defense Face A Purge, America's "Official" Jewish Groups Look For Justice To Promote Agenda "America is finally running out of patience with us" the headline read in the Israeli daily Ha'aretz Tuesday. Sharon had just rebuffed the American demand that Israel withdraw its troops to behind the lines of occupation, and was holding more than five thousand Palestinian refugees trapped in the 'Aida and 'Azza/Beit Jibrin camps. On Wednesday, the butcher Sharon began shooting the refugees as he did in 1982.. The US State Department was "feeling like a fire brigade" struggling with the potential for war not just in Afghanistan, but in Occupied Palestine and Kashmir as well. On the home front, Israel's allies in the United States were also scrambling. Having been defeated in their attempts to use the September 11 bombing to draw the United States closer to Israel, they were facing a purge of their supporters in the Defense Department, as it became clear that their agents on the inside were leaking US secrets to both Israel and the press. The "official" Jewish lobby was now scrambling for damage control, and grasping at anything to distract public attention away from the US-Israeli relationship. "Saudi Arabia is the home of . one of the most fanatical, intolerant, and extreme forms of Islamic fundamentalism," Mortimer Zuckerman, an American media baron, publisher of US News and World Report as well as the New York Daily News, and head of the powerful Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, wrote in his weekly column. There had been a "mendacious implication . that the September 11 attacks were related to America's relationship with Israel" but now, Zuckerman wrote, "we . must face the harsh fact that Saudi Arabia, a nation we have long supported, is a central disseminator of the poisonous spores of fanaticism." Could the Zionist lobby be serious? Could it really be trying to persuade the public that the reason for bin Laden's attack on New York was not US support of Israel, but the fact that the US paid "moderate" Muslim regimes in the Middle East primarily to keep them from attacking Israel? If a directive issued by Israel's Foreign Ministry to pro-
Israeli journalists was indication, they were. And the attempt to distract the public showed the growing desperation the lobby is using in its efforts to keep the disintegrating situation in the Middle East from becoming a disintegration of their political power here at home. The Changing Tune Only a month ago, the Zionist-dominated elements of the American press were demanding the heads not of just the Taliban, but of the entire population of the Islamic world. "America's enemy is the Islamic Axis: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan and Afghanistan and the groups they fund, support and direct. These groups include the cells of Osama Bin Laden, Hamas, Hezbollah and the PLO," wrote ex-Israeli propaganda minister turned American journalist Zev Chafets, in Zuckerman's New York Daily News, "The U.S. must invade these countries (if there is time), dismantle their unlatched governments, disperse their armies and seize their arsenals. . If there isn't time [they] will have to be destroyed by whatever means necessary: the Japanese model." Chafets was not alone. "The enemy has identified itself in public and openly . Its name is radical Islam" wrote columnist Charles Krauthammer on Sept 12, "there should be no talk of bringing these people to 'swift justice' . We must carry their war to them." They were just two of hundreds of voices, most of them Zionist, or at least tied into America's "official" Jewish lobby, that demanded the destruction of Islam. Little more than a month later, their tune had changed, from a rumbling war-mongering drum beat to a softer song of explanation and excuses: "What spawned the real Osama bin Laden . was the infidel's 'occupation'' of Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca and Medina, the holiest cities in Islam." wrote Krauthammer on October 19, as he played along with the fiddlers trying to dance America's attention away from Israel, "Bin Laden . in giving reasons for his jihad on America, never fails to cite the starving and bombing of Iraq." Newspaper columns now avoided talk of Israel, not even recognizing the Israeli occupation as a possible complaint of bin Laden's, and certainly not mentioning it in the context of "terrorism". Israel was no longer safe. The Israeli lobby was on the defensive. Elder Lore There is no question that a Jewish lobby, with goals and interest beyond just Zionism and Israel, exists in America. It is divided into three major "umbrella" organizations - the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council (NCRAC or "nacrac"), the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations (the "President's Conference"), and the American-Israeli Political Action Committee (AIPAC). Each organizations is a council of smaller groups, and has responsibility for a certain area of Jewish political life -- NCRAC issues a yearly document laying out the domestic political line that the nation's Jewish groups have agreed to adhere to, the President's Conference issues the foreign policy line, and AIPAC conducts the actual lobbying of Congress and the Administration. There are nine major groups that form these councils, though each group has between 50 (for the President's Conference) and several hundred members on its theoretical governing body (and AIPAC is unofficially controlled by it's four-member "officer's committee"). There are the groups that represent the three main trends of American religious Judaism - the national unions for the Reform, Conservative and Orthodox synagogues. There are the three "defense agencies" - the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), American Jewish Congress, and the American Jewish Committee. Then there are the three women's organizations - Hadassah, the National Council of Jewish Women, and the Women's American ORT. There are additionally as many as 300 other "official" Jewish organizations active in the country and contributing representatives to the councils in various ways. The lobby works like the Mafia within its own community, brutally suppressing Jewish voices that dissent from its foreign policy dictates. According to Jewish writer JJ Goldberg, editor of the Jewish commentary paper the Forward, and author of the book "Jewish Power": "By mid-1976 . NCRAC and the American Jewish Committee ordered up internal studies on the limits of dissent. The Presidents Conference and the Synagogue Council of American held public inquiries on the topic. All the organizations reached the same conclusion: American Jews had the right to discuss issues freely, but only within discreet forums, outside public view. . "Working closely with [Israeli Ambassador Simcha] Dinitz and his staff, the Presidents Conference and NCRAC began to draw up a set of baseline principles to govern behavior within the organized Jewish community. They boiled down to three basic tenants. One was that Israelis were the only ones entitled to decide Israeli policy, since they alone bore the risks. The second was that American Jews must stand publicly united with Israel, and air disagreements only in private. The third was that Israel would no negotiate with Palestinian terrorists, since talking to them would grant them legitimacy "These rules were quickly taken up by the Jewish leadership as sacred write from Jerusalem. Jews who disagreed found themselves unwelcome in community forums, asked to leave governing boards, shouted down at meetings. Even luminaries . began to find themselves ostracized after they endorsed Middle East compromise." Like the mafia, they will rub you out - not your life, but your reputation. With extensive contacts inside both political parties and the mainstream press, the "official" Jewish community keeps its members under tight lock and key. Cracks In The Press The Lobby's muscle arm in America and abroad, though it is often impolitic to state it outright, are the major media institutions in America that are owned by Jews, combined with those that are not owned by Jews, but dominated by non-Jewish Zionists. (see "American Media Uses Disinformation To Guide Policy") To this they add many of America's most widely published and widely read opinion columnists, editors, "independent" publishers, and reporters. Even those in the media who choose to distance themselves are not immune to its pressures, as two American journalists recently discovered when they were purged from their newspapers for anti-Israeli statements. Freelance writer Jim Moore was the first of the two. Over the weekend, he submitted an article to the Tallahassee Democrat, daily newspaper of Tallahassee, Florida, and owned by the Knight-Ridder Corporation. The article was one of several he had written that were critical of Israel, but this one was a little different. It included a quote from Ariel Sharon, broadcast on Col Yisrael radio, that "Jewish people rule America." Managing Editor Mizell Stewart feared the implications of Moore's piece and refused to print. Moore received notice barred from ever again writing for the paper the next day. Though Israeli officials have publicly admitted that Sharon "had bouts of anger during a recent Knesset meeting and that he said 'things that shouldn't be said,'" this didn't matter to Knight-Ridder. Though it is not a Jewish owned or managed company, it still plays ball. When asked to explain their actions, Stewart referred Pravda's inquiries to a secondary editor who declined to respond. A second, and bigger, crack appeared over the weekend in upstate New York, where two editors for the Oneida Daily Dispatch were fired after publishing an article quoting a Pakistani man who claimed that the September 11 attacks were conducted by Israel's Mossad. The article, and all references to the two, were pulled from the Daily Dispatch's website ( and according to an Associated Press article on the case that ran on October 19, Managing Editor Jean Ryan and City Editor Dale Seth were dismissed from the paper. Notsurprisingly, the paper is owned by the Newhouse Media Group, a Jewish newspaper group owned by the brothers Samuel and Donald Newhouse - two men who's wire services regularly carry often ridiculous articlesattacking "right-wingers" and "racists", real and imagined, across America. But the third "crack", though it was only slight, is perhaps the one that most threatens the currently locked armed approach of the media in its attempts to misinform the American public. When Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz Alsaud had his $10 million dollar check rejected by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, every newspaper in New York applauded Giuliani but one - the usually Zionist New York Post if Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Why? According to columnist Johnathan Tobin, writing in Jewish World Review, "[the Prince] is, among other things, a major stockholder in News Corp., the multinational media conglomerate that owns the Post." Defensive Front It is not the occasional slip of a reporter's tongue, however, which has the Lobby in a dither, nor is it the small financial influence of one Saudi on one paper that has never truly been in their control. What bothers them most is that everything they demanded of the Bush administration - war on Iraq, war on Syria, war on Hizbollah, war on Hamas - had not only been denied them, but they are facing, for the first time in thirty years, a government that seems ready to simply remove them from policy making altogether. Two Defense Department officials - Richard Perle on the Defense Policy Board and Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense - comprise the core of the Zionist lobby's influence over US foreign policy. But their dual loyalty has caused them to leak to the press a number of important details of the US military's actions in the Afghan campaign - including top secret information on a US Special Forces raid on airfield near the city of Kandahar. The information caused the raid to fail, and the nearly 200 Special Forces troops involved in it to force evacuate the area only two hours into their mission. The result has been a Secretary of Defense who has threatened to not only dismiss, but possibly arrest, the "unknown" individuals responsible: "The fact that some members of the press knew enough about those operations to ask the questions and to print the stories was clearly because someone in the Pentagon had provided them that information. And clearly, it put at risk the individuals involved in the operation," Rumsfeld told the London Times Monday, and "It is terrible. And I just can't imagine people being that irresponsible that they're willing to do that . I couldn't care less where the source of the leak is, the responsibility is the same." Though Rumsfeld did back off his threats to arrest those responsible, and stated that responsibility was "unclear", it is clear that the lead candidates for the leak, two men who have been previously identified as leaking Pentagon data to the members of the press such as radical pro-Israeli journalists Bill Safire and William Kristol, were Perle and Wolfowitz, causing some observers to wonder if the President's Conference's dynamic duo were about to be dismissed from public duties. And as a further indication of US unhappiness with Israeli-loyal "American" citizens in the military, the Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday on the first wartime purge of an Israeli-American "dual citizen" from US forces. US Army Reserve Major Shawn Pine was relieved of his command of the 300th Military Intelligence Company of Austin, Texas, Tuesday after being accused of suspicious links to the Israeli military-intelligence complex. Pine, of course, accused the Army of "anti-Semitism", but all his complaining has not gotten him his reinstatement. Part II tomorrow.....

Sorry Sandy, I got it right the first time - it is not an insult
to all other women because I specifically identified her, I did
not make a general statement about all women - pc-ism be damned.
The following message was posted to [a list] Hi all,
I hate talking about individuals on a list like this, but the misleading statements being put out by one Nancy Oden need rapid rumor control. Defending her half-truths would make us look silly.
I got to meet Nancy three years ago when she was in Seattle for the national committee meeting of the activist organization known as "the Greens/Green Party USA," which should not be confused with the national electoral organization, "the Green Party of the United States," which nominated Ralph Nader for President and helped get him on the ballot in 44 states.
Nancy was incredibly rude to her fellow activists. She talked endlessly about how mean the Maine Green Party had been to her, and about how evil the Greens from "that other Green organization" were. I dismissed her as a run-of-the-mill kook.
Then, this past spring, she somehow got elected to the three-member Coordinating Committee of G/GPUSA. Her tenure involved a string of 2-1 decisions taking authority away from the larger Green National Committee, and shutting down various processes in the bylaws that were used to try to overrule her. Eleven of the 13 state parties then affiliated with G/GPUSA had called for a membership referendum on the "Boston Proposal for Unity." (Only six are needed to call such a referendum.) Nancy used her power on the CC to prevent any money being spent to hold the referendum, and continually threatened to fire the two staffers who were trying their best to obey the bylaws. To say that Nancy was abusive toward the staff would be an When the pro-unity supermajority was unable to ever get a vote called on the Boston Proposal, most of the state parties started disaffiliating. G/GPUSA is now down to four state parties, two of which are still in the process of disaffiliation.
Meanwhile, GP-US, which is expected to finally be recognized as "the national committee of the Green Party" by the Federal Elections Commission some time in the next two weeks, has 33 affiliated state Nancy Oden got elected to the G/GPUSA CC on a platform of "real democracy, where We the People ..." Instead, she ran the organization with an iron fist and sent nearly everyone fleeing to more productive Nancy's latest heavy-handed rhetoric does not match up with what I've been reading in the Bangor news. She was not targeted at the airport because she was a leader of the G/GPUSA. She was targeted because she was rude to the security officers. Indeed, the FBI say they had no idea who she was. Other Green Party leaders have had no trouble whatsoever flying.
Nancy was not banned from flying. She was simply not allowed to fly that day. Nancy said she did not put up resistance to having her purse searched (a standard procedure long before 9/11) or personal search. She just went crazy at the metal-detecting wand. I know Nancy well enough to know why she would freak out at the use of such a radioactive instrument around her body. She is a long-time anti-nuke We risk delegitimizing ourselves by defending Nancy Oden's hysterical account of airport security. We'd also be causing more well-intentioned Green-Party-activist wannabes to go to G/GPUSA's web site and pay dues to G/GPUSA, not knowing that it is not the national Green Party that put together the convention in Denver and nominated Ralph Nader for president.
If GP-US puts out a press release today, I hope it presents a more balanced account of what really happened between Nancy and airport security, and points out that Nancy's organization is *not* the national Green Party.
Sorry to rag on fellow activists.

The time to fight it is after, when there is a tort, not when you
are desperate and at their mercy.  Oden will not get far, I expect.
You said "Yeah, just like all those other rape victims..." except she was not a rape victim, the plunging neckline and miniskirt is not at issue.  This is more like stripping all your clothes off for a stroll
through the park at 2 AM, as I said in my response.
Why is that in quotes?  Where did it come from?  Regardless, you are not
reading me, you are inferring from me if you believe that.  I said she brought it on herself, I did not say she deserved it.
Stirring through the responses to me, it strikes me that those of you who have taken issue with me are the ones offended, I'm just calling the situation like I see it.
That what she did was dumb and that she brought it on herself?
Here is what she said about it all, in her own words, from
   "There was this National Guard guy there. He yells over at me,     so everyone can hear, 'Bring your bags over here.' You know     how they are when they're all puffed up with themselves. He     said, 'Hurry up,' so I slowed down some more.
Slowed down some more.
    "I put my bags on the table. The two women employees were     standing there. [I tried to help them with a stuck zipper.]     He grabbed my left arm, he started yelling in my face, Interfering with the baggage searchers.
    I said, 'You can't do that.' He went to grab my arm, and I     said, 'Don't touch me.' Lipping off at the security personnel.
    I saw an older airline guy shake his head, 'No,' and he     backed off. The "No" could have meant anything, including she failed the search.
    "That insulted his little manhood. Her subjective opinion, this interview is filled with it.
    I heard him say real soft, 'Don't let her on the plane,' like     he was talking to himself. We have only her word for this.
    "Then I go to get on the plane since we're all done and everything,     and the American Airlines ticket guy says,' You can't get on the      plane.' I say, 'Why not?' ... He says, 'Because this guy says you     didn't cooperate with the search.' ... She didn't.      "He said, 'Maybe we can get you on the 4:00 plane, He offers.
    He said, 'Come with me.' I followed very slowly, I sat down for a     while. I said I'm carrying these bags; I need a rest... It's called     passive resistance. Passive resistance.  Resisting.  She didn't cooperate with the search or anything else, did she?
    He went and got six other National Guard guys and they all approached     me. Here are these six untrained, ignorant, don't-know-how-to-deal-
    with-the-public, machine-gun-armed young guys in their camouflage     suits with their military gear hanging off of it.    "I looked up and started laughing, She laughed.
   "They had the airport policeman tell me, 'You're not flying out of    this airport today.' ... After all the shit, they respond.
   They wanted to get back at me somehow because I was not a subservient    female, because I questioned their manhood. She interprets wrongly, again.
   "I went to the American Airlines guy and said, 'Is this just today?'    He said, 'I don't know.' One clerk said, 'You could drive to Boston    [five hours away] and see if you can get out of there.' They still offered to get her to her destination, until she finally pissed them all off.
Here is what Wal Sheasby said about it all.
Written by Walt Sheasby on Solidarity List Serv. Who is Walt Sheasby? See, for example: LEADER OF GREEN SPLINTER GROUP FIBS ABOUT AIRPORT HASSLE
In an official press release from its Chicago headquarters, the
Greens/Green Party USA, a small splinter group that opposes
recognition of the Green Party of the United States as the
electoral voice of the movement that ran Ralph Nader for
President in 2000, declared that one of its leaders was stopped
from boarding a flight after a check turned up her name was on a
computer list because the organization opposes the U.S. bombing
of Afghanistan. The release said:
"Armed government agents grabbed Nancy Oden, Green Party USA
coordinating committee member, Thursday at Bangor International
Airport in Bangor Maine, as she attempted to board an American
Airlines flight to Chicago."
"An official told me that my name had been flagged in the
computer," a shaken Oden said. "I was targeted because the Green
Party USA opposes the bombing of innocent civilians in
The press release was relayed around the nation as a first signal
of the reach of the new draconian Patriot Act. But it turns out
that Nancy Oden was apparently not barred because of a computer
check, but because she did not comply with standard screening for
weapons. While who said what is not clear, it appears that her
name was not flagged by a computer search of potential terrorists
or their supporters, according to a news report in the Bangor Daily News on Nov. 3.
While the undue harassment of airline travelers is to be
condemned, it does not seem that this incident warrants fears of
a major violation of  Constitutional guarantees of free speech,
as it first appeared. The group that Nancy Oden leads is
nevertheless using the incident to draw attention and support to
One member of the group's National Council urged:
"The first thing to do is to organize a committee, include
spokesperson/ spokespersons. Contact civil liberties
organizations including the National Lawyers Guild, the ACLU ...
Ask organizations to sponsor defense committee- Seek prominent
attorney who may need to have a license to practice in Maine-
Send releases out every day. Has Ralph Nader been contacted? What
about Phil Donahue CONTACT TALK SHOWS. TRY TO GET POLITICIANS TO
SUPPORT, Barbara Lee. Organizations in Maine who know Nancy and
will back her up."
If the incident had taken place as Nancy Oden described it, it
would mean that other Green activists and leaders of other
anti-war groups would also be on computer lists and barred from
flying, which reportedly has not been the case. The exaggeration
of her victimization may only serve to discredit opposition to
the Bush Administration's attack on civil liberties.
It may also further isolate the Green Party USA, which saw a
majority of delegates at its July 20 National Convention leave to
form a new Green Alliance, which has its first convention in New
Orleans January 18-21.

how her ticket was purchased, then singled out for special treatment
because of how she acted in the airport.
No, you still don't get it.

Her name was flagged in the computer, which Ms. Ogen MISINTERPRETED as meaning it was because of her politics.
The real story is that it was flagged, but not because of
politics, but because she bought her ticket online. People
who use Expedia, CheapTickets, LowestFare, Orbitz, and other
rock-bottom and somewhat ANONYMOUS ticket services are having
their tickets flagged for (S)earch much more frequently than
people who use ticket agencies or buy their tickets direct
from the airlines.

Dig deeper, you'll find that all airline passengers who purchase tickets online get flagged for bag searches (discrimination by auto-selection).
Were other green party members detained or singled out?  No.  Were other green party members denied air transport?  No in both cases, else we would have heard about that by now too, right?
One of the airport flunkies even says they'll try getting  her on the 4 pm flight, she plays stick in the mud a bit more and gets herself bounced out of the airport, so yeah, go through the park naked at 2 AM, you have no grounds to object if approached by someone who is naked - what you do from
there is on you.
She was not denied right to travel (as Tim thought), she was free to get in her car and drive to another airport, to a private plane or even all the way to her destination if she wanted.  She was denied the use of that
particular mode of transport at that particular time, "we" cannot ride horses on the freeway either.

Whatever Jim.  Have it your way, a century of precedent means nothing.
The text of the Constitution and all the replies to other people were
a nice touch, I skipped right over it.

States are not prohibited from having a militia, the National Guard is an
organized militia, until such time they are federalized, at which point
they fall under the Army's Chain of Command.
Why do you think all or nearly all states have a National Guard, if it is
prohibited as you claim?

Working for the governor of their respective states, unless you're saying they've been called up by the Army and federalized.  There is a long list
of actions by Guardsmen by direction of state governors, you need to show
how this action is in violation of that precedent if you want to make that

That's right, whether "I" like it or not.
At the moment, it's National Guard, there is a long precedent for use
of Nat.Guard troops for civil things.  So long as they do not bring in
regular active duty military, in violation of the posse comitatus act.
An issue in its own right, the airlines were requiring it before 911 and the airline requiring it is not the same as the government wanting
The Patriot Act still amazes me.  What were those congresscritters
thinking?  They weren't, just reacting blindly by the looks of things.

You've yet to show how the airport departure lounge and check-in counter
is the proper venue to address this.  It isn't.

Suit yourself.  I said she brought it on herself by acting the way she did, which
is redundantly evident.  It's also clear you are objecting to the
word "cunt" so I used "prick" also.  If it makes you (or anyone
else) feel better I'll retract both the explicatives but I stand
by the original assessment - she was dumb to think she could resist
the way she did with impunity.  Further, she lied about it in the
press release we saw yesterday, Declan's interview revealed that and the statement from Walt Sheasby I posted (and which Declan
reposted) confirm that.
Misanthrope is the better word because I do not hate all women,
just the stupid lying ones.  You use your choice as a pc weapon.  Pardon me why I cry myself to sleep.  Really.  Interested in some

You stupid prick, what makes you think I am a misogynist?
(hint, "misanthropist" is the word you wanted).

Generic identifier of specific individuals who have distinguished themselves by performing specific behaviors, "as fucked up as a football bat" would be similar to the informational content of "cunt"
as I used it, note that I used "prick" and "cunt" in reference to
males (yourself and Choate) in similar contexts.
That didn't stop you from decrying my lack of "socialization," then
scant days later when you called Choate a "pompous ass" it struck me that you are not a bona fide pc-ist, you are just a hypocrite.
I disagree - it wasn't a general reference to women, it was a general
reference to a specific person who happened to be a woman, I suggested
you call Choate a "dumb cunt" too.
I don't think I am having it both ways, but in any event I won't play this game with you any longer.
