@_subject: Re: [discuss] Worm Klez.E immunity 
Having had 4 little gifts from klez in the last two days, I am wary about opening messages like one below with an attachment that very well could contain another klezzie.
Why couldn't the moderator or one of his henchmen, tell us whether it's safe to open?
Any thoughts?
