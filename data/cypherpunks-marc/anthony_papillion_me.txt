I like this idea. But I don't think it's something the core Tor devs should be working on. Too many ethical questions and too many 'gotchas' if things go wrong. Perhaps it's something an independent dev might want to take on but I'd keep it completely separate from Tor at all costs.

I would think that simply finding a mail server that doesn't log
ANYTHING (like what StartMail is about to offer) and encrypting
everything should be enough. Of course, you'd need to trust that the
service really isn't logging anything but that could be solved by
accessing it via Tor.
So StartMail (when it opens) via Tor should do the trick.
Just a thought,
