Thank you for your response.  For the record, I have faxed my
Representative and, for good measure, both my Senators.  Phone calls are
also great -- I just have more difficulty with them :-/ .  For those
that prefer an easier, but less personal and therefore (probably) less
effective method, I submit these links for contacting your Congress
Thank you!
P.S.  A call-out to Nick Mathewson.  Thank you, also!  I hate to be the
bearer of bad news, but this seemed like it might be important.  I do
appreciate what all of you do at a technical level.  Unfortunately, we
have to be aware of politics also.

I haven't seen this brought up on this list yet, so I thought I would mention it.  Tech Dirt (among others) are reporting on yet another round of misguided (U.S.) legislation supposedly targeting copyright infringement.  Part of this legislation involves attempting to prevent DNS from resolving "offensive" domain names.  The part that seems like it could potentially affect Tor (in my non-lawyer) mind is:
"To ensure compliance with orders issued pursuant to this section, the Attorney General may bring an action for injunctive relief.... against any entity that knowingly and willfully provides or offers to provide a product or service designed or marketed for the circumvention or bypassing of measures described in paragraph (2) and taken in response to a court order issued pursuant to this  subsection, to enjoin such entity from interfering with the order  by continuing to provide or offer to provide such product or service."

I have been following that NANOG discussion as best I can  (Sometimes my eyes do start to glaze over.)  A lot of that discussion seems to involve a lot of suppositions about what is really going on.  I was wondering if there is any new public information available beyond what was released immediately after the raid.  For example, has it been verified that William actually was raided as a result of what  passed through a Tor exit node he was running?  And is there any reason to believe his situation involved anything beyond simply running an exit node?  (A lot of the NANOG discussion seems to imply that he himself must have been doing something illegal.)

For some reason this didn't go through a couple days ago.  Try again ...
When Pamela Jones stopped posting articles on Groklaw (TMK the website
is still there) some members of the Groklaw community attempted to
continue the tradition at  .  I haven't
kept up on what is going on there, among other reasons, because I had
trouble accessing the site via Tor.  It is also possible that by now
they have moved the site to a different domain since there was talk
about FreeForums being a stop-gap measure until they could get something
