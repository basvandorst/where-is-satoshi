At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including
human beings. Little Tommy, a child in¡¡the kindergarten class, seemed
especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of
Adam's ribs.Later in the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he
were ill, and asked, "Tommy, what's the matter?"Little Tommy responded, "I
have a pain in my side. I think I'm gonna have a wife."
Professor Laurie of Glasgow put this notice on his door: "Professor Laurie
will not meet his classes today."A student, after reading the notice, rubbed
out the "c". Later Professor Laurie came along, and entering into the spirit
of the joke, rubbed out the "l".
A young executive was leaving the office of a major corporation late one
evening when he found the CEO himself standing in front of a shredder with a
piece of paper in his hand. Eager to make a good impression, the young exec
introduced himself and asked if he could be of any help. "Why yes," said the
CEO, holding up the piece of paper. "This is a very sensitive and important
document, and my secretary has gone for the night. Can you make this thing
work?" "Certainly," said the young executive, happy for a chance to help the
boss. The young man turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and pressed
the start button. "Excellent, excellent!" said the CEO as his paper
disappeared inside the machine. "I'll need two copies." uv20kuyokwenzekalani62ehartebeesthoek .
