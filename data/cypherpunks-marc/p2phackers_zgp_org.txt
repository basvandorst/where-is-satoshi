Hash: SHA1
Does anyone have any references they would recommend which talk about the
problems of time in a secure and distributed environment?
Specifically, how do you keep others from cheating and saying that an event
happened in the past when it actually happened in the present?
I have tried to get some resources from google and other crypto hackers but I
can't seem to find anything substantial.
There HAS to be some prior research in this area!
