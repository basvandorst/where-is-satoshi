Observing Mastercard today, apparently none.
Can't blame stupid users or Microsoft for this one, either. The 'attackers'
using a .NET tool which I'm sure all of us are familiar with, LOIC. It
voluntarily (with user's consent!) adds their machine to a botnet controlled
somebody from 4chan over IRC. Because that can end well.
Blaming Microsoft for DoS attacks and spam is so passÃ©. These mouthbreathers
the bigger threat, I think.
