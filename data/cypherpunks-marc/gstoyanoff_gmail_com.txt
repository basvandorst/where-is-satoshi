Hi guys,
Thank you for your help once I put my isp news server as the server I
was able to get access to comp.lang.python.
Thank you for your help :)

Hello everyone,
I am a python beginner and look forward to learning the language and
working on some interesting projects using it.
I was wondering if anybody may help me get access to the news group
comp.lang.python I am trying to access it using KNode but I get an
"unable to resolve host name" error.
Thank you.
