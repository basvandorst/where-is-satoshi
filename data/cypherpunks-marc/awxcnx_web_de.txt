do you run a TOR server on a virtual server without connection faults?
A year ago, I tested a tor server on virtual hardware (Virtuozzo) and I
got many TCP connection faults in "/proc/user_beancounters".
Is a TOR server now ready to run with less then 1024 TCP connections?
Or do you have a virtual server, which does not have low limits for TCP
connections? In this case the offer of 1blu is very nice for TOR.

I know, it is a Tor list. But please let me write this:
What do you think about a remailer (Mixmaster or Mixminion), something
like TOR for emails. Emails are more private than surfing in my opinion.
If you did have the power to admin a few tor server, you may run a
remailer too. It may share a server together with TOR. The traffic is
not very high: 5.000 mails per day. It uses at max. 16 TCP connections.
And it can act as a middle-man like TOR. For Mixmaster a working MTA
("exim4" or something else) is required, for a Mixminion middle-man nothing.
The size of the remailer networks decreases in the last 6 month down to
35 nodes for Mixminion and less than 30 nodes for Mixmaster. Hope, we
can stop this trend. Large networks for high anonymity are needed.
I am ready for help, if somebody needed any docs. (in German too)

I have checked a few long-runnig TOR nodes in the Sorbs SPAM blacklist:
Many of this servers are blacklisted in the database of
vulnerable/hacked servers:
"Likely Trojaned Machine, host running unknown trojan"
The nodes I checked are mostly well administrated and run actually
software over a time of 1 year. It may be, they are listed in other SPAM
blacklists too.
