The only obvious potential terrorist on the Cpunks list is Tim May.
He fits the profile.
He is paranoid,armed to the teeth,hates democracy.
Hates the U.S. Government, which he refers to as the Z.O.G.
Has called for the Nuking of Washington D.C.
Only 300 killed in the recent attack. He must be real disappointed but maybe many more next time Tim.
Hates big cities especially on the east coast.
Hates Israel.
Hates Jews.
Hates those that don’t think like he does, “they need killing”.
Is generally unhappy with the modern world and would see it burned down and rebuilt in his own particular vision.
Seems Tim never has a nice day. Except perhaps 9/11.
