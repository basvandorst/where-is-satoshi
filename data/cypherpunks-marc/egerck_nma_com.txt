Interesting Q&A paper and list comments. Three
additional comments:
1. DRM and privacy  look like apple and speedboats.
Privacy includes the option of not telling, which DRM
does not have.
2. Palladium looks like just another vaporware from
Microsoft, to preempt a market like when MS promised
Windows and killed IBM's OS/2 in the process.
3. Embedding keys in mass-produced chips has
great sales potential. Now we may have to upgrade
processors also because the key  is compromised ;-)

PS: We would be much better off with OS/2, IMO.

The question of "what is trust" might fill this listserver for months.
But, if we want to address some of the issues that Pd (and, to some
extent, PKI) forces on us then we must be clear what we mean when
we talk about  trust in a communication system -- what is a trusted
certificate, a trusted computer? Trusted for what? What happens
when I connect two computers that are trusted on matters of X --
are they trusted together on matters of X, less or more? What do
we mean by trustworthy?
I can send you some of my papers on this but the conclusion I arrived
is that in terms of a communication process, trust has nothing to do with
feelings or emotions.
Trust is qualified reliance on information, based on factors independent of
that information.
In short, trust needs multiple, independent channels to be communicated.
Trust cannot be induced by self-assertions -- like, "trust me!"  or "trust Pd!"
More precisely, "Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel
but cannot be transferred using that channel."  Please see the topic Trust Points
by myself in Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security by Jalal Feghhi,
Jalil Feghhi and Peter Williams, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-20-130980-7, pages
194-195, 1998.
That said, the option of being *able* to define your own signatures on what
you decide to trust does not preclude you from deciding to rely on someone
else's signature.  BTW, this has been used for some time with a hardened version
of Netscape, where the browser does not use *any* root CA cert unless you sign
it first.
Thanks for your nice  comment ;-)

It may be useful to start off with the observation that Palladium will not be
the answer for a platform that *the user* can trust.  However, Palladium
should raise awareness on the issue of what a user can trust, and what not.
Since a controling element has to lie outside the controled system, the solution
for a trustworthy system is indeed an independent module with processing
capability -- but which module the user should be able to control..
This may be a good, timely opening for a solution  in terms of a "write code"
approach, where an open source trustworthy (as opposed to trusted)
secure execution module TSEM (e.g., based on a JVM with permission
and access management) could be developed and -- possibly -- burned on a
chip set for a low cost system. The TSEM would require user-defined
signatures to define what is trustworthy to *the user*, which would set a higher
bar for security when compared with someone else defining what is
trustworthy to the user.  The TSEM could be made tamper-evident, too.
Note: This would not be in competition with NCipher's SEE, because NCipher's
product is for the high-end market and involves commercial warranties,
but NCipher's SEE module is IMO a good example.

The principle here is that no one should be able to prove how the voter voted, not even the voter. Yes, votes need to be verified and voters are certainly one party that can do it. However, you never want to allow the voter to take any kind of "receipt" out of the voting station if that receipt can be used to determine how the voter voted, e.g. by matching a number or pattern on the ballot, even if to the voter. Otherwise, vote selling and coercion cannot be prevented.

The lowest possible totals are per race, per ballot box. The 'second law' allows you to have such totals -- which are the election results for that race in that ballot box. For example, if there are two candidates (X and Y) in race A ,
two candidates (Z and W) in race B, and only one vote per candidate is allowed in each race, the election results for ballot box K might be:
Vote totals for race A in ballot box K:
  Votes for candidate X: 		  5
  Votes for candidate Y:   		 60
  Blank votes: 	         		 50
Vote totals for race B in ballot box K:
  Votes for candidate Z: 		 45
  Votes for candidate W:   		 50
  Blank votes: 	         		 20
Total ballots in ballot box K: 	   	115
Because only the vote totals are known for each race, a voter cannot be identified by recognizing a pre-defined, unlikely voting pattern in each race of a ballot. This exemplifies one reason why we need the 'second law' -- to preserve unlinkability between ballots and voters.
No. All you need is that there should be more than one voter
per ballot box. This is a rather trivial requirement to meet.

The privacy, coercion, intimidation, vote selling and election integrity
problems begin with giving away a receipt that is linkable to a ballot. It is not relevant to the security problem whether a voter may destroy his receipt, so that some receipts may disappear. What is relevant is that voters may HAVE to keep their receipt or... suffer retaliation...
not get paid... lose their jobs... not get a promotion... etc. Also
relevant is that voters may WANT to keep their receipts, for the same
As long as this does not go against the 'first law' for public voting systems: voters must not be linkable to ballots.
The 'second law' also takes precedence: ballots are always secret, only
vote totals are known and are known only after the election ends.
There is no tradeoff prossible for voter privacy and ballot secrecy.
Take away one of them and the voting process is no longer a valid
measure. Serious voting system research efforts do not begin by
denying the requirements.
There is no such principle.
You don't have this option when the public at large is considered, for
a public election. You can do it in a private election for a club,
for example, but even then only if the bylaws allow it.

The flaw in *both* cases is that it reduces the level of privacy protection
currently provided by paper ballots.
Currently, voter privacy is absolute in the US and does not depend
even on the will of the courts. For example,  there is no way for a
judge to assure that a voter under oath is telling the truth about how
they voted, or not. This effectively protects the secrecy of the ballot
and prevents coercion and intimidation in all cases.
Thus, while the assertion that "Only if all the trustees collude can
the election be defrauded" may seem to be reasonable at first glance, it
fails to protect the system in the case of a court order -- when all the
trustees are ordered to disclose whatever they know and control.
Also, the assertion that "All of this is possible while still m
aintaining voter secrecy and privacy essential to all public elections" is incorrect, for the same reason.
Moreover, the assertion that "Vote receipts cannot be used for vote selling or to coerce your vote" is also incorrect, for the same reason.
These shortcomings do not depend on any specific flaw of a shuffling
process, a TTP, or any other component of either system. Rather, it is a design flaw. A new election system should do "no harm" -- reducing the level of voter privacy and ballot secrecy should not be an acceptable trade-off for changing from paper to electronic records, or even
electronic verification.
Court challenges are a real scenario that election officials talk about and want to avoid. Without making voter privacy inherently safe from court
orders, voter privacy and ballot secrecy are at the mercy of casuistic, political and corruption influences -- either real or potential. When the stakes are high, we need fail-safe procedures.
Now, you may ask, is there any realistic possibility of a court order for all trustees to reveal their keys?
Yes, especially in a hot and contested election -- and not only Bush vs.
Gore. Many local elections are very close and last year an election
in California was decided by *one* vote. For example, the California Secretary of State asked this as an evaluation question, when they were testing voting systems for the 2000 Shadow Election Project.
The question was whether and to what extent the voting system could be broken under court order   for example, if some unqualified voters were wrongly allowed to vote in a tight election and there would be a court order to seek out and disqualify their votes under best efforts.
Perhaps a trustee could be chosen who would be immune even from a US
court order?
Well, not for a US election, which is 100% under state and/or federal But there are additional scenarios -- a bug, Trojan horse, worm and/or virus that infects the systems used by all trustees would also compromise voter secrecy and, thereby, election integrity.

a counterpoint...
:-) that's one S too many. For true believers, KIS is enough.
If the real vote (the thing that gets counted) is machine-read
from the OCR-B, and the voter is verifying the human-readable OCR-B text on the ballot, then how can one say the vote is really You end up trusting the machines after all, both for scanning as well as for tallying. In addition, the paper ballots could also be falsified and the totals would be wrong even if someone would have us believe that their machines are infallible.
Machines are not 100% efficient when counting paper ballots. There
are misreads, rejections, jamming, etc. The usual procedure is to feed
the ballots twice in the machine, for verification. What happens
if the result differs? Since you don't know which paper ballots were misread, you MUST end up having to count them ALL manually. Florida law,
for example, unequivocally requires a manual recount in a close election
