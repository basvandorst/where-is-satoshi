And who would be "we" ? And who are "they" ?
You seem to have some conclusive evidence ... care to share with "us" ?
No, Ms. Propaganda, this is not war, this is bullshit.
It is (according to the past history) a natural path for the empire to
gradually become a police state because of dissent (which the state,
naturally, labels as "terrorism"). This progresses until internal
pressure builds up to the point of disintegration. Nothing new here,
except that US managed to do in 60 years what took others centuries.
While it is easy to understand why the feeble-minded gather around the
official story (and flag-waving politicians) when they feel threatened
by dark & hairy foreigners, it should be obvious that such grouping is
the main long-term consequence of "terrorism", and that the state is the
principal profiteer.
It is impossible for USG to "attack their strategy" while remaining USG.
And I can not see a single reason that would compell USG to do so.

Looking around for someone to smite, Glasgow's Daily Record found a
soft target in one David Munro, who thought impersonating a plane in
front of an American player at a soccer match was a Good Thing.
Is the world going crazy?  Has the new offence of Griefcrime been
established, whereby those who do not temper their opinions to
respect mass 'hurt feelings' deserve exactly what's coming to them?
I'm guilty of Griefcrime too.  I haven't shed a single tear, because
I don't know anyone who has ever been to New York.
I've told the odd joke to close friends about the disasters.  I've
argued back at the TV when idiots talk about the need for unity, or

Or am I relegated to anonymous cowardice by a fear of the same character assassination at my trial by media?

Daily Record, Tuesday October 2, 2001
By ALEX DOWDALLS and RON MOORE
THE moron who used the World Trade Centre tragedy to taunt Rangers'
Claudio Reyna is named and shamed today by the Daily Record. David "No Neck" Munro's stepdad said he should be jailed for mimicking
an aeroplane in front of the American star at Sunday's Old Firm game.
Mum Ann was close to tears as she branded the Celtic "fan" a disgrace.
Reyna said: "You wouldn't think something as sick as that would
come into someone's mind." And the Parkhead club banned Munro for life, telling him he had shamed
the whole of Scottish football. Munro jumped to his feet and stretched
his aims out like aeroplane wings as New Jersey-born Reyna prepared to take a corner at Ibrox. He was one of the tiny minority in
the Celtic section who made the sick gesture. More than 6000 people
died in the attacks on the World Trade Centre. The Record was flooded
with calls from fans after we appealed for help to name the yob.
Supporters described Munro as a drunken idiot who also caused trouble
on a bus going to Celtic's game with Juventus. Our trail led to
Munro's mortified mum and stepdad in Johnstone, Renfrewshire. The
jobless lout still lives with his parents at the age of 32.
Mother Ann McKeeman choked back tears as she said: "I couldn't believe
what he did. He was so full of the drink and didn't know what he was
doing. He's a disgrace. David hasn't come home since and is too
ashamed to face us. He's staying at a pal's house.
Stepfather Bill added: "I wish he had run onto the park and done it
in front of the players. He would then have been lifted and jailed
then and that's what he deserves. "He has let us and the club down."
Ann said Munro has a spinal disability and had been taunted by Rangers
fans before his gesture towards Reyna. But she admitted there was no
excuse for his actions.
Reyna confirmed he saw the gesture. He said: "It's disgusting to think
about it because of how horrible the tragedy was. "I did honestly
think about it afterwards and I was surprised. "I thought that if anything Tragedy would teach people to unite and
not to act like that
"I wouldn't care even if he'd had a lot to drink. You wouldn't think
something as sick as that would come into someone's mind.
"If they can punish the person, they should. It was pretty awful - how
someone could stoop so low."
Celtic spokeswoman Kate Cunningham confirmed: "This person will be
banned with immediate effect and his season ticket will be withdrawn.
"He has brought immeasurable shame on this club and all of our
supporters. "Our fans are gutted by what he has done and we don't want
him or anybody with that. kind of sick mind anywhere near the stadium.
He has shamed the whole of Scottish football." Decent Celtic fans shared the club's outrage. One supporter who knows
Munro said: "The guys were almost fighting among themselves to try to
restrain him. "He is an out-and-out trouble-maker. Imagine if your
relatives had perished in America and you witnessed this total clown
pretending to crash a plane. "Fans from both clubs are up in arms. The guy is one sick puppy and
needs to be taught a lesson." The supporter said Munro was so drunk on
a fans' bus to Turin that other supporters feared for their safety. He
was finally thrown off the coach and went "absolutely mental", kicking
at the vehicle in a rage.
Another fan said Munro stole a bottle of champagne as the bus
travelled through France but was let off with a warning by police.
Munro is a notorious character in Johnstone, often seen drunk in local
pubs. Former schoolmates, who gave him the "No Neck" nickname, said he
was 'spoiled rotten" as a child. One claimed: "No Neck was wasted by
his mum and dad. "He never wanted for anything and always wore the
best designer gear. He was always acting the clown, boasting and
shouting, a right wee show-off.
"Yet he has nothing to shout about. He was an absolute failure.
"He never learned a thing and left without any qualifications. "The
guy has still not grown up - he's just a 32-year-old idiot without the
sense God gave him."
Munro has been in hiding since his photo appeared in the Record.
His mother said he had contacted Celtic to apologise and planned to
say sorry to Reyna in a letter.

Saudis May Ask U.S. to Leave,
   Washington Post Says
   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's rulers are growing more
   uncomfortable with the U.S. military presence in their country and may
   soon ask that it end, The Washington Post reported on Friday.
   Citing a senior Saudi official, the newspaper said senior Saudi rulers
   believe the United States has ``overstayed its welcome'' and its forces
   have become a political liability.
   The official told the newspaper that Saudi Arabia would prefer a less
   conspicuous military cooperation once the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan
   (news - web sites) is over.
   If asked to leave, the United States would no longer have regular use of
   the Prince Sultan Air Base, where American forces have maintained a
   presence since the 1991 Gulf War (news - web sites).
   Washington's relationship with Saudi rulers has been strained by the
   Sept. 11 hijacked airliner attacks on the United States that killed about
   3,100 people and were blamed by the United States on Saudi-born
   militant Osama bin Laden (news - web sites). Most of the 19 suspected
   hijackers were Saudi citizens.
   The presence of U.S. military forces in Saudi Arabia -- currently
   numbering about 5,000 -- has been repeatedly cited by bin Laden as a
   key reason for his violent opposition to Saudi rulers.
   The Post said among the reasons Saudis give for deciding that it may be
   time for the Americans to go is that they do not want to appear to be
   dependent on U.S. military support.
   The American presence has become a political liability in domestic
   politics and in the Arab world, Saudi officials told the newspaper. The
   Post said the Saudi government has also become increasingly
   uncomfortable with a role in U.S. efforts to contain Iraqi President
   Saddam Hussein (news - web sites).
   The Post said Pentagon (news - web sites) spokeswoman Victoria
   Clarke declined to answer when asked whether Saudi Arabia has told
   the United States it will ask for an American withdrawal.
   ``We have a very good relationship with the Saudis,'' she told the
   newspaper on Thursday night, and ``we will continue to work with them
   in as cooperative a fashion as possible as we go forward.''
   Saudi officials who spoke about a U.S. withdrawal told The Washington
   Post that nothing would be done precipitously. They said Crown Prince
   Abdullah -- the kingdom's effective ruler given the frail health of King
   Fahd -- did not want to create the impression that he was responding to
   pressure from bin Laden.

[Ed: choice quote: "Everyone is a suspect"]
January 15, 2002 -- A new Web site devoted to local politics is breaking one scoop after another - but the one story it won't report is who's behind the effort.
PoliticsNY.com, launched Dec. 3 as a sister site to PoliticsNJ.com, beat all the local media in disclosing how Mayor Bloomberg was trying to block Andrew Eristoff from becoming the Manhattan Republican leader.
It also was first to reveal that former Mayor Rudy Giuliani was establishing his own repository for his official papers.
"Everyone's all hyped up about the site," said City Councilwoman Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan). "You constantly get asked, did you see such and such on their Web site."
Proud as they are of their exclusives, the authors - who appear to be well-connected - are no Matt Drudges: They won't step forward to claim credit.
"We have chosen to remain anonymous, much like when James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers under the pseudonym 'Publius,' " the writers proclaim in a message on the site.
One City Hall official said he's treating "everyone as a suspect" because some of the stories have so much background information that "it can't be someone new to the scene."
A Post source fingered the chief author as a former staffer in the Giuliani administration.

Bin Laden book banned
                    From AFP
                    December 31, 2001
                    A FRENCH book about Osama bin Laden, called The Forbidden Truth,
                    had been banned in Switzerland at the request of one of bin Laden's half
                    brothers, Yeslam Binladin, his lawyer, Jurg Brand, said.                     Binladin is claiming 20 million Swiss francs ($23.73
                    million) in damages for defamation from the co-authors,
                    Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie, and the
                    publishers of the book, Guy Birenbaum and Olivier
                    Rubinstein of Denoel publishing house.
                    He claims the book falsely says he was closely linked
                    to the man blamed by the United States for the
                    September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.
                    The German translation of the book, which was due to
                    be published in Switzerland in the next few days, has
                    also been banned.
                    Binladin has lived in Switzerland for about 20 years
                    and has held a Swiss passport for nearly a year.
                    Brand said further legal action was planned in Switzerland.
                    A complaint has also been lodged against the French website
                     for promoting the book. The disputed book's
                    co-author, Dasquie, is the editor in chief of the website.
                    Binladin says he has not had any contact with his half brother for a number
                    of years.

Thermal camera may detect lying
               Published 1/2/2002 2:04 PM
ROCHESTER, Minn., Jan. 2 (UPI) -- An experimental new lie detector that measures sudden flashes of heat from around the eyes may soon provide another line of defense against terrorism.
"This is the first technology that allows lying to be measured or lying to be detected without any contact with the subject whatsoever instantaneously, in real time," said lead researcher James Levine, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. "You don't need to hook them up to anything -- you don't need any sophisticated experts to analyze the data."
The researchers say prototypes of the device may aid security operations within the next two years, in areas such as airports and border checkpoints. However, Levine also is concerned about the potential ethical ramifications of the technology if it ever becomes developed for the open market.
               "If this technology really becomes developed to the desktop phase, you could be sitting in front of your boss                and he could ask you 'Do you think you can meet your deadline?' And you can say, 'Sure, of course,' and                he'd say, 'I know you're lying,'" Levine said in an interview with United Press International. "Or, on a date,                one's boyfriend could say to a person, 'Are you serious about wanting to get married?' and when she                answers the question, she's being photographed."
               "On the other hand, when thinking about the possibility of someone with explosives in his shoes boarding a                plane, given the technology's security potential, I think most of us would want this application to be                accelerated as quickly as possible," Levine added. "We're making advances in science, and I think the                ethical issues need to be dealt with when the advances are being made. Otherwise ethics gets left behind,"                he said.
               The device consists of a high-definition thermal imaging camera the size of a shoebox. The scientists also                have developed a miniaturized version of the camera, roughly the diameter of a postage stamp. Both are                hooked up to a filing cabinet's worth of computer hardware.
               "As people lie, there is a massive increase in blood flow around the eyes, and associated with that there is                sudden warming around the eyes, where the color changes to white in the thermal imaging system," Levine                explained.
               The researchers made their discovery accidentally three years ago while studying, of all things, gum                chewing. They were using the thermal imaging device to study the facial muscles at work to analyze how                physical activity affected metabolism.
               "We got these beautiful thermal images every time someone chewed gum, and by accident we detected the                very subtle changes that occur in the face with fearfulness -- there was a loud bang when a book fell on the                lab floor," Levine told UPI. "The changes in the face that came with that were very consistent with several                individuals. And we thought, 'My goodness, if this can detect these very subtle changes instantaneously,                perhaps we can see these same changes with lying.'"
               The research team had 20 volunteers commit a mock crime and then assert innocence under experimental                conditions at the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute in Fort Jackson, S.C.
               Eight of the volunteers stabbed a mannequin and stole $20 from it, while the rest had no knowledge of the                crime. The device accurately detected lying roughly 80 percent of the time, a precision level comparable to                standard lie detecting polygraph tests performed by experts.
               "Is the method detecting stress or deceit?" commented physicist Gerry Yonas, principal scientist at Sandia                National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M. He suggested the researchers needed to further compare this                new data with other methods of stress and deceit detection.
               Levine agreed more evaluation was needed under a variety of conditions outside the laboratory, taking into                account factors such as wind speed or what people had to eat.
               "If this technology has the remote possibility to do what it could do, it's mandatory to get this carefully                evaluated as soon as humanly possible," Levine said.
               The researchers reported their findings in the journal Nature.

      A student at Manchester University proposed the motion
      Large numbers of students are expected to converge on Manchester       University to demonstrate over an attempt to brand Israel an "apartheid       state".       A motion being proposed by a Manchester University student and supported       by the Islamic Society, argues that Israel is carrying out human rights       abuses against Palestinians.       Students from across the country are travelling to the city to support and       protest against the action on Wednesday.       If it is passed, Jewish students fear anti-Semitic sentiment will lead to       the ban of Jewish societies within universities and fuel prejudice.             The proposal draws a parallel between South African and Israeli             apartheid and human rights abuse             Andrew Perfect, Students' Union       General secretary of the university's Students' Union, Andrew Perfect said       tensions on campus were running "fairly high".       He said they were expecting at least 1,000 people in the debating hall,       students outside and people from the local community.       He said: "This is a human rights motion regarding abuses against the       people of Palestine.       "The proposal draws a parallel between South African and Israeli apartheid       and human rights abuse.       "We are expecting at least 1,000 of our 24,000 members to vote, with lots       of others outside, as well as a large number of people from around the       country and a number from the community."       Heated debate       The motion is expected to be debated for most of the afternoon.       Greater Manchester Police have been notified of the expected crowds and       are sending officers to the event.       A police spokeswoman said: "We are aware of it and there will be a low key       presence to ensure it passes off peacefully."       Mr Perfect said: "Tensions are fairly high on campus at the moment.       "But this is not the first time something like this has happened. In 1996,       a group of students tried to ban the Jewish Society."       A spokesman for the university said they had read the motion and were       satisfied it was "a legitimate debate".       He said: "The motion relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine and       that is why some kind of heat has been generated.       "We are expecting it to be quite heated."
Islamic Society at Manchester University Human Rights For Palestinians
Dear Friends, Peace Be Upon You.
We would like to bring to your attention that students at Manchester University have felt that there is a need to condemn the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in their own homeland, by the racist 'Israeli' apartheid regime, on an official level.
A motion detailing the atrocities and blatant disregard for human rights was submitted to the Students Union to be discussed and voted on in a general meeting next Wednesday the 27th of Feb. at 1.30pm in the Academy.
Unfortunately, certain groups opposing this motion (hmm, I wonder who that could be?!), have sunk to all time new lows in trying to divert the attention away from the issue up for discussion.  They have resorted to attempted provocation and outright childish behaviour in an attempt to stop this motion.
However, those supporting the motion, have been ignoring these pathetic attempts, much to the despair of those opposed to it.
What's on this microsite?
Well, due to the huge support we have received from people up and down the country, we have decided to add a diary of events including pictures detailing what has been going on.We have also added a list of links that you may find What Can You Do?
Keep sending us your comments via email : muisoc and spread the word about what is happening at Manchester University.  More importantly, remember us in your du'a.
There will be more information soon...

Ah, the PETAphiles can't detect a joke. Who woulda guessed.
Can we put a hard number to the "couple of percent range"?
Think of it as evolution in action. Eventually, even the FTC will grow a clue.

Friday marked the end of insomnia for Young, Brett Brendix and the rest of the Moon Dogs, a troop of reservists who worked from midnight to noon for the past six months. Gov. Gray Davis authorized posting 800 troops at 30 California airports to boost security following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
"We're ready to go," said Brendix, the noncommissioned officer in charge of the 12 soldiers on the night shift at SFO.
Brendix said he hasn't slept well during the day, and is looking forward to being closer to his family in Sacramento.
"My wife told me she can't wait until I can be home to help with family responsibilities again," said Brendix, a father of two. "She's had to be both mom and dad, and it's been pretty tough on her."
At Sacramento International Airport, 50 members of the National Guard who have been staffing security checkpoints since Oct. 12 were feted at a ceremony to thank them early Friday morning.
"It was a successful mission and the soldiers and airmen were proud to serve," said National Guard spokeswoman Denise Varner. "But they are happy to go back to their lives."
"The threat is still there," said National Guard Col. Terry Knight. "Has anyone done anything yet? No."
Guardswoman Alexsandra Serda, 19, said travelers weren't always pleased with the presence of armed guards standing watch with guns. She said on her first day on the job at the San Francisco airport, an elderly woman shoved a soldier after airport staff took away her two butter knives.
"A lot of the old ladies tend to get rowdy," she said.
Guards said the job was sometimes boring as they stood watching and waiting with their M-16s in hand. Defusing tempers of frustrated passengers was the most common action they saw. But passengers said Friday they will miss the guards.
"I hate to see them leave," said Hugh McCullough of Cincinnati, returning from a cruise with his wife, Donna. "I feel more comfortable with them than with the rent-a-cops they will be getting."

Here are the perl scripts I cobbled together to put the ring signature
at the end of the file, after a separator.  I called the executable
program from the earlier C source code "ringsig".  I call these ringver
and ringsign.  I'm no perl hacker so these could undoubtedly be greatly

# Usage: $0 pubkeyfile < filetoverify
die("Usage: ringver pubkeyfile < filetoverify") if  != 1;
$outfile = "/tmp/sigdata$$";
$sigfile = "/tmp/sigfile$$";
$separator = "  \\+\\+multisig v1\\.0";
-r $pubfile || die ("Error reading $pubfile");
open (OUTFILE, ">".$outfile) || die ("Unable to open $outfile for output");
open (SIGFILE, ">".$sigfile) || die ("Unable to open $sigfile for output");
# Skip leading blank lines on input file
$_= while /^$/;
# Save lines to outfile until separator
print OUTFILE $_;
while () {
die ("No signature found in input file") if !$_;
# Save remaining lines ot sigfile
print SIGFILE while ;
close INFILE;
close OUTFILE;
close SIGFILE;
open (SIG, "./ringsig -v $outfile $pubfile < $sigfile |") ||
# Print output from program
print while ;
close SIG;

# Usage: $0 filetosign pubkeyfile privkeyfile
die("Usage: ringsign filetosign pubkeyfile privkeyfile > outfile") if
$outfile = "/tmp/sigdata$$";
$separator = "  ++multisig v1.0";
open(INFILE, $ARGV[0]) || die ("Unable to open $ARGV[0] for input");

@_subject: Signing as one member of a set of keys 
This program can be used by anonymous contributors to release partial
information about their identity - they can show that they are someone
from a list of PGP key holders, without revealing which member of the
list they are.  Maybe it can help in the recent controvery over the
identity of anonymous posters.  It's a fairly low-level program that
should be wrapped in a nicer UI.  I'll send a couple of perl scripts
later that make it easier to use.
 *  * by Rivest, Shamir and Tauman
 *
 * This creates and verifies a signature such that it was produced from
 * one of a fixed set of RSA keys.
 *
 * It requires the openssl library to build, which is available from
 *  *
 * This program takes a PGP public key ring file which holds a set of
 * old-style RSA public keys.  It creates and verifies signatures which
 * are such that they were issued by one of the keys in that file, but
 * there is no way to tell which one did it.  In this way the signer can
 * leak partial information about his identity - that he is one member
 * of a selected set of signers.
 *
 * To sign, the signer must also give a PGP secret key file which holds
 * one key (actually the program ignores any keys past the first).
 * That key should be the secret part of one of the keys in the public
 * key file.  Also, it should be set to have no passphrase - it is too
 * complicated for a simple program like this to try to untangle PGP
 * passphrases.  So set your key to have no passphrase, then run this
 * program, then set it back.
 *
 * The program outputs the signature in the form of a list of big numbers,
 * base64 encoded.  There will be as many numbers as there were keys in
 * the public key file.  So signatures are quite large in this scheme,
 * proportional to the number of keys in the group that the signature
 * comes from.  They are also proportional to the largest key in the
 * group, so all else being equal try not to include really big keys if
 * you care about size.
 *
 * The signature is not appended to the text being signed, it is just
 * output separately.  The signer can combine them manually with some kind
 * of cut marks so that the recipient can separate out the signature from
 * the file being signed.  Some perl scripts that do this are supposed
 * to be distributed with the program.  (That is what is used to verify
 * the signature in this file itself.)
 *
 * The recipient must use the same PGP public key file that the signer
 * used.  So that may have to be sent along as well.  He runs the program
 * with the PGP file and the file to be verified, and sends the signature
 * data into stdin (using the "<" character).  The program will print
 * whether the signature is good or not.
 *
 * This program was written in just a couple of evenings so it is
 * a little rough.  This is version 0.9 or so - at least it works.
 * It has only been tested on my Linux system.
 *
 * The program is released into the public domain.  See the end for
 * authorship information.
