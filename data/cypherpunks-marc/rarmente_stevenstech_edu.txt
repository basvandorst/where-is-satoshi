@_subject: A question 
I am familiar with the netBSD operating system by using it in the cs lab
at stevens institute of technology but now I ran into a problem when i
tried to install it.
I downloaded the iso files from the netbsd.stevens-tech ftp site
(i386cd.iso,  i386pkg1.iso, i386pkg2.iso, i386pkg3.iso) into my computer
running windows xp.
Then i recorded the images into cds, but when I ry to open them under
windows it says "D is unavailable, the file is corrupt and unreachable"
and when I restart my computer with the installation cd in it wont start
at all and the computer proceeds to load windows. I have the load from
cd rom option sellected in the BIOS. What could be my problem? Why are
the cds from the images unaccesible in windows? Is this a recording
problem or have I missed a step? It happens with all the cds created out
of the iso's.
What is the i386cd.iso image used for?
  Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.
