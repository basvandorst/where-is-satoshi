Hi Cypherpunks, How quickly does it work? The doctor told me when he prescribed it that the first time I tried some it would take a little while to work, like almost an hour, and to be patient. So I took it, and set back to wait. I was surprised to find out that I didn't have to wait near that long. I was ready to go in fifteen minutes, and went a little longer than she wanted me to go.
