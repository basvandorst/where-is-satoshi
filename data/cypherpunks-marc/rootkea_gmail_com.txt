Thanks. I'll take a look.
I am NOT going to install another operating system to read my emails. ;)

Thank you for the reply Greg!
munge or otherwise direct or update the messages you receive:
Thanks. I'll use the List-Id field to filter the messages as I have
moved to Thunderbird.

Good to know. :)

Wow! Thanks for mentioning Mailpile. It looks promising. Completely
open source with built-in PGP support! I'll give it a try.
But now I'm wondering what other FLOSS mail clients are there which
have built-in PGP support with bells and whistles?

Yes. I have been wanting to use GPG keys in Tunderbird using Enigmail
for so long! Thanks for reminding me of Enigmail. :)
And yes. Gmail or any 3rd party webmail is garbage when it comes to
privacy. Moving to Thunderbird. (Not comfortable with mutt yet!)

Hello Vasily! Thanks for the reply. BTW I don't see a single reason
why would someone get offended. :)
As I said may lists follow the practice of prefixing the list name to
subject. It helps in quickly identifying the message without even
clicking on it.
Now about tweaking the client, which one do you use which gives the
ability to quickly spot the messages just by having a single look at
your mailbox?
Even if we filter messages we still need to click on the folder which
contains those messages. I don't see a valid reason for not saving a
user click and user's time.
That being said, if there are not enough people who get affected by
this issue and we decide to continue the current practice I am
thinking about using Gmail "Labels". :)

Hey Georgi, I know that we can set filters but thanks for the tip anyways. :)
It's just that prefixing a list name seems to be a standard practice.
Many lists follow it. And it helps actually! Saving us a click for
entering into the directory/mailbox. We can spot the Cypherpunks
emails from just a single look at our mailbox. :)

I am subscribed to handful of mailing lists and I'm sure many of you
are too. It gets pretty overwhelming when I check my mailbox at the
end of day or after couple of days.
I would like to request the admins/owners to add [Cypherpunks] at the
beginning of a subject by default to easily spot the mails from
Cypherpunks list. This can be easily done by tweaking the appropriate
Mailman settings and I can see that we are using Mailman to manage
this list.
What do you guys think?
