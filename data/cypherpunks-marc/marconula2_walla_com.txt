@_subject: tsunamis donnot ignore? 
My name is Marco Nula; I am a victim of the recent Earthquake followed by
the Tsunami that wrecked our whole society of Banda Aceh Province in
Indonesia resulting in painful death of my Parents.
My Late Father Mr. Alfredo Nula is from Paramaribo in Suriname (South
America) and my Mother from Banda of Aceh Province in Indonesia, they got
married in Suriname because Indonesia like Suriname was a colony of The
Netherlands, but they moved to settle in Indonesia when my Sister and I were
born and because Indonesia has better economy than Suriname, but my Sister
and I was away in School in the Capital Jakarta when this sorrowful
incidence happened to my late parents and all other Families affected by the
Quake and the Tsunamis all around Sumatra and Aceh Province.
My Father and Mother owned a tourist resort and grocery store at No 71
Panglima Polim Street, Banda Aceh in Indonesia, it was visited by numerous
tourists from different countries on Holidays each year but these tragic and
devastating Tsunamis took the lives of my parents and many others.
My Late Parents saved much of their money in a Bank in The Netherlands, not
only because we were Dutch Colony but also because we speak Dutch as an
official Language in Suriname, I contacted my Parents Lawyer in Hague and he
has confirmed to me that my Parents has the sum of 9Million Dollars
deposited in savings in The Netherlands which will be claimed by me as next
of Kin, but he also explained to me that because I was not nationalized in
Netherlands after Suriname got Independence from the Netherlands I had no
permission to settle there in that Country.
We have recovered the corpses of my Late Parents, although private,
International and Government Aids is coming in, it will not be any where
enough to settle our problems, please I am hereby soliciting for your
assistance in clearing my Late father's money, while I will have the Lawyer
arrange the necessary document that will enable you have the power of
Attorney to effect the funds release from Netherlands. As soon as you show a
sincere intentions to help me and my Sister, if you are business oriented
with experience in Holiday, Hotel and Resort business or have some idea on
how to run a groceries shop, I am willing to recommit the money for the full
benefit of all (My Sister you and I) apart from that I shall be willing to
give a negotiable percentage of the money to you otherwise or alternatively,
please contact me on my email address as the telephone system is not
functioning at the moment.
Thank you, I hope you understand our predicament and come to our
Marco Nula
