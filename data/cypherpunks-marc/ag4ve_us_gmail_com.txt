or, lets take a real example - rsa gets compromised and a third of the
authentication tons (most?) of government agencies were using is all
of a sudden vulnerable (possibly more than that if you consider that
rsa could've lost classified technology). rsa has to realize the
threat and can take their time to disclose what they want to disclose.
i think if i were in the power to fix that, i would *try* :) ie, i
highly doubt a massively scaled system has a chance at detecting most
also, i don't really like the idea that someone might be monitoring my
activities (who watches the watchers). however, if i were in the
position of acquiring data about threats, i think i'd try to suck in
as much data as i had the processing power to manage.

No kidding. I think someone on here told me about them and I tried to get
one a bit later and couldn't. I think the company I work for might also get
a few as well. It's not like they're the only ones that sell these, but
they /were/ the only ones to sell USB PRNG at <$800.

They're also not super good. They barely keep up with my ssh traffic and it
took ages to create a key for whatever Arch wanted (don't recall what).

I don't follow this - I understand why lack of entropy should block
urandom but, why shouldn't it block on a running system that

I thought that decent crypto programs (openssh, openssl, tls suites)
should read from random so they stay secure and don't start generating
as being a smart thing to do is if these programs also looked at how
much entropy the kernel had and stopped when it got ~50 or so. Is this
the way things are done when these programs use urandom or what?

Do we have any proof of this? Is there any record of how we did business with Crypto-AG? Well yes, windows with noise and radiation deflection or refraction and blast resistant probably cost more than those in your dining room. Also, we read this (and most of us are involved with this in some capacity for a living). This makes us spend a bit more time (and possibly money) securing our data. For example, the company I work for does lots of pentests - do you think we use an Active Directory domain? So if I'm working at a place that figures how to listen to LTE, do you think I'm going to let my employees use LTE? How much does it cost to get end to end encryption on a modern phone? How many models and chips do I reverse engineer? How many Angry Birds APKs do I do dynamic (and maybe static) analysis on? The report said they obtained information through hacking. So how much does their ingress and egress monitoring cost? What types of monitoring have they developed for mobile devices (bet someone like Mandiant has a killer contract for this)? You see $250 and wonder how you can spend that much. I see that and think "for that price can I have another". Again some proof would be nice. I've heard there is (or was) a BestBuy in the Pentagon that has standard prices on items. I'll bet that store is highly subsidized (scanning people and packages, shielding, etc) but I'd doubt the store sees much (any?) more profit above their other stores. cryptography mailing list

Just an example of how to spend $250M. cryptography mailing list

If you'll notice that both political parties have expanded on the NSA's mission, scope, and probably funding. I doubt there are any business motives here. In fact, it seems to me there are the exact opposite. Though, since much of government is now contracted out, I do wonder who this was billed out to? Also sorta interesting that the possibility of the NSA contracting a French company (Vupen) to find exploits. I always assumed HP, Rapid7, Mandiant, etc would do this type of thing and that it would be easier to clear companies in the US. cryptography mailing list

I strongly agree with this. For example, people are told to use a password
managers for each site and most people end up with the same password across
hundreds of sites - is that a user failure or one of software? I copy and
paste passwords between pgp files and browsers all the time but I don't
expect my mom to.
Well kinda (not necessarily "overconfidence" but the example). How about
this: would the creator of gnupg be getting >$100k per year (I think it's
renewed in 5 years - I suspect it will be) without the NSA things? Point
being, jumping at shadows can cause productive fear (until you die of a
heart attack).
Orgs with otherwise pretty damn secure software setups do education next to
teach their people how not to mess up again (this is generally done after a
pentest). However, your average organization isn't going to do this - your
average person can't do this. So I wonder whether we really want to change
habits or make software that learns to conform to the user while staying
We're starting to build them - take Proton Mail for example. No need to
know pgp, generate a key, verify keys (I don't use it so IDK how they
handle trust). The keys are local to you. It seems there might be
shortcomings with this but I'll give them "pretty good".  And this is just
one example of how you can take a pretty sophisticated software and make it
so that end users can deal with it and aren't likely to leak data and the
OTOH, systems like Active Directory that are hard to setup, not scalable,
allow downgrading of hashes, and have issues like PtH central to the
protocol. Again, not something you can blame a user for - just a badly
designed system. We can do better - should expect better.
