No, the moral of the story is that those of us who have been active in CFRG
and the IETF groups that depend on it are well aware that Kevin is a real
person.  He comes to IETF meetings and wears a bowtie and a badge that says
"NSA".  There has never been anything hidden about his name or his
affiliation or the reality of his existence.
That said, the IETF and IRTF purposely don't have a "papers please" policy

Kevin is a regular IETF attendee, and an author of several RFCs.
He is most definitely a real person.
