Dear: cypherpunks
Gadget roots out hidden `pervert' cams
Big Brother is here, big time. You may not know it but you may be watched in places where you'd expect privacy - such as dressing rooms, hotel rooms, tanning beds, private offices,  public washrooms etc. Now there is a device that
        can detect the presence of a hidden camera or any device that emits an electronic signal. 
        A woman can use this device to check their surroundings when 
        she goes in a washroom or any place where a camera may be hidden. CLICK HERE for details.
