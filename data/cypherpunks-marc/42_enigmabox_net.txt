decision. And I'm curious by myself where it may take us... :)
Thank you too! Great to hear.

Understandable. Currently, we use Debian, but moving to OpenWRT, which
is in test phase at the moment. When we're done, I'll offer dd images
for flashing your own CFcard. Until then, you may build your own image
directly: Its tailored for the PC-Engines alix2d3 board. If you have such boards,
you can set up a network of Enigmaboxes at home; or join the
Projectmeshnet IRC channel and ask for a peering - or set up your own
And no, there is no "software" that you can run on your machine for

off your workstation and still be able to receive emails or phone calls.

Now that everyone knows that they are being flagged when visiting the

Hash: SHA1
The CEO of TrustLeap contacted me recently to boast about his
"unbreakable" security, and that 'we' are doing everything wrong and
"all open source software is backdoored".
Quotes from the website:
What do you think about that?
There is a challenge: ...so I thought I'll share it with you guys.
