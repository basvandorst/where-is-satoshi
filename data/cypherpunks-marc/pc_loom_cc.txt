Chuck game theory.  I'm not talking about an intricate prisoner's
dilemma with layers of feedback here, just a simple matter of benefit
versus cost.
I disagree, but it's irrelevant anyway.  I'm not talking about big chewy
abstractions like "society", just individual interest.
Because the benefit to me did not exceed that particular cost.  I did
however spend some amount of money and time on computer and physical
security.  Some of the benefits of my efforts are shared by others.
Thank goodness.  I can't imagine what such a horror could even mean in
the first place.
It is generally wise for that person to back away, though in specific
instances people do find it mutually advantageous to look out for each
other.  As a small example, people in my neighborhood have alerted each
other to the presence of suspicious characters.
It amazes me that some glibly assert that people will voluntarily fund
the assassination of a politician, but would not voluntarily fund the
investigation of a string of crimes which cost money and lives. --
especially given that "crowdfunding" is all the rage these days.  The
view strikes me as excessively dismal and eeyorish.

That doesn't matter.  All that matters is that the benefit of solving
the crime exceeds the cost of solving it.
Forget retribution.  The primary benefit of an investigation is the
insight which enables you to prevent future crimes.  That can be
enormously valuable in terms of life and property.
The advantage is the same when your problems are the same, which is
often the case.

You could also crowd fund an investigation of the abhorrent activities
listed above, finding the people who do such things and stopping them
with gentle persuasion.
That's good, because decent people outnumber sociopaths by a very large

An old friend of mine summed up the basic physics of the situation:
You mentioned that "concerted action" would have to be more than
everybody doing their own thing.  Not necessarily, if "doing your own
thing" means conducting one's affairs in such a way that minimizes the
net benefit to those who would restrict your freedom, while still
providing a net benefit to yourself.  That goes to the heart of my
friend's point.
He goes on to say that notions like "mass action" or "mass
enlightenment" are just more collectivist drivel, and he's rather
emphatic about it:
It's all about the physics, though discussing the specifics can be

You may not believe in scarcity, but I know one thing for a fact.  I
have a limited amount of food in my refrigerator, and a limited
tolerance for strangers in my house.  You may not call that "scarcity"
but it sure sounds like scarcity to me.  So I'll say it again:  if I
wake up one morning and find you in my house eating my food, you-gonna
be in big trouble Lucy.

Please, no large scale plans, I beg you.  I simply wish to see the
emergent effects of countless individuals interacting with each other
solely on the basis of mutual consent.  That is all.

Now THAT is a good point.  I thought you were deriding the very concept
of ownership.  If you're saying that private property is such a good
idea that maybe we should *try* it sometime, then I'm with you.

Ownership is an exclusive right of use or disposal.  If I wake up one
