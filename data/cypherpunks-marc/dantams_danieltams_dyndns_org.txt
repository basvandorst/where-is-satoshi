@_subject: Re: [Full-Disclosure] JAP back doored 
The choice of your subject line makes it seem that the article says that JAP has been backdoored again. The article does not say that. The article says that the police received a court order permitting them to enter and search the facilities of the Technical University of Dresden in order to find the data that was captured by the backdoor when it was in use.
