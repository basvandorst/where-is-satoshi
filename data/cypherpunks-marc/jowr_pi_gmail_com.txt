@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
That's what *slays* me about this.
On one hand I think its' great to have a tor hidden service for
facebook as there are legitimate use cases for it.
On the other, the juxtaposition of the least privacy-sensitive tool in
the WORLD against tor is a contrast that damn near hurts to look at.
This will be a continual source of amusement for me, but maybe
something of value will come out of this.
