I'm a little unease with all these labels you use to portrait people.

Would American citizens be against imposing their State the obligation to provide the defendant with full access to the data held by the persecutors? Obligation to indemnify those who they have wrongly and unlawfully persecuted? Provide full access to the public as regards to their past operations and maintained databases for public scrutiny?
Who is this all around enemy that is everywhere but there, inside the agency?
