For the 3 co-founders, they appear to provide the exact same info as when
the Wayback Machine first captured the people page in 2010.
I don't see any indication of connections to the US Intel Community based
on looking them up online.  I see connections to Law Enforcement for
Matthew Prince, but connections to law enforcement != connections to Intel
I'm not debating the idea Cloudflare could receive an NSL which is true for
any US company (although I think most countries have some equiv).
You are telling us to do our homework.  Since we don't seem to be seeing
the same information that you are, can you point us at some sites?  Maybe
the search engine you are using is pointing you in a different direction
than Google is pointing me or maybe you know better search terms.
