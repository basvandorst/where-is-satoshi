You can find version skype-2.1.0.81-fc10.i586 on the skype web site.  As far as I know this is the latest skype for fedora and works fine on F12.  If you want your webcam to work with it you will need to invoke it as follows:
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype
You will also have to install libv4l-0.6.4-1.fc12.i686 (or the corresponding F13 package)
