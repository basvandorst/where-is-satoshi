@_subject: Registering a moment of invention? 
I invented something that I consider quite valuable.
It is an idea for a mathematical method.
It already works as intended, in a business process.
I am not interested in patenting this shit, however, I want to make sure that
I get the credit for this invention when (if ever) it becomes publicly known.
So I would like some kind of real timestamping service. I would prefer
something meatspace based, like a notary or US mail based or whatever.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Just wondering if it is now available. I have a throat slitting video
from Chechnya, can trade if you require trade.

Would not be an act of disconnecting other nodes be an act of
proprietorship also?
I personally think that a separate filtered list would be a better
solution, more choice and all.

@_subject: choate free mailing list? 
I am thinking of starting an additional mailing list that will consist
of cypherpunks messages, sans anything posted by Jim Choate, proffrv,
any other prolific news posters, and will not have any traffic from
Please note that I do not need it for my own benefit as I already
doing my personal filtering. So I will only do it if there is a
sufficient (> 9 individuals) interest expressed.

@_subject: I am enjoying high quality cypherpunks discussion 
All I had to do was to killfile several individuals and one
cypherpunks node. Now I enjoy meaningful posts, aside from very
occasional spams (most spams are rejected at my node).

I can imagine how "orderly" would that evacuation be when the

@_subject: Reminder: filtering at algebra.com 
I want to remind everyone that algebra.com is a filtered node.
The only filtering is done as follows:
1) No mail is accepted from several domains that are known for
spamming (such as Taiwan, virtumundo.com etc). Note that mail from
other cpunk nodes never falls into this category. This is done at the
server level as a service to all communities that algebra.com supports.
2) No mail is propagated unless it had "cypherpunks" in the To: or Cc:
fields. This cuts down on spam.
No other filtering is being done.
Note that I personally set up my personal filter to ignore cypherpunks
mail from certain individuals or posted to one particular node. This has
nothing to do with other recipients of cypherpunks mail.

@_subject: Re: List analysis. 
There were many posts I am glad I did not see, as Choate and ssz and
all news posters are in my killfile. So at least searching for good
posts got a little easier.

@_subject: Re: distributed filtering with server-side NoCeM's (Re: 
In practice, it is very difficult to set up. The approaches that we are
discussing now are needed to support people who are too lazy or stupid
to have a killfile. (a simple killfile completely suffices, as I see
none of the Choate postings and such). And those individuals are even
less able to use nocems than they are able to use killfiles.
I am, right now, enjoying a wonderful low volume mailing list, after
some postings, nodes and posters are filtered out.

@_subject: Wireless IP? 
I am asking here because I do not know where to ask, really. I would
like to be able to connect a windows/linux laptop computer to the
internet wirelessly, via some kind of a cell phone (I am not
interested in wireless LANs).
Any practical suggestions will be appreciated.
I would make my own dialup number out of my second phone line.

algebra.com also qualifies.
I have some aggressive spam filtering that generally applies to all
mail coming to algebra.com, but I do not yet block ssz.com.

@_subject: algebra.com becomes a more filtered node 
Just wanted to let everyone know that algebra.com is becoming a much more
filtered node. Two things to be aware of:
1. I use a lot more of general antispam filtering. I use several dns based spamhaus blackholes, a access control list from wirehub.net, and my own list
of spam patterns.
At request of other nodes, I can share what I do which at this point has become
rather effective. Spam that passes through other nodes is more difficult for
me to eliminate.
2. (more controversial). I eliminate all traffic that I receive from, or that was
sent to, one particular cypherpunk node, as well as everything that was sent
by the node's owner. Essentially all traffic that is related to that node goes
to the bit bucket. I am rather tired of both the content as well as the network
bandwidth consumed by that node. I send nothing to that node either.
The goal that I personally pursue is to make the list more readable to
me and to use less of my bandwodth. I am not even sure how many valid
addresses are subscribed to algebra.com, since I transferred a lot of
them to minder.net a while ago.

@_subject: body parts of astronauts 
I can understand the argument that the parts of the shuttle are
government property, so their "conversion" to private property
may be criminal.
But astronauts are not government property. So if, let's say, a charred head falls into my backyard, then it would be legal for me
to put it into a jar with denaturate alcohol, as a souvenir, right?
