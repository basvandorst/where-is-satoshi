If you only let these mythical omnipotent "developers" of yours near any
IT system then the economy will grind to a halt.
I think a better alternative is to look not just at usability of
cryptosystems for users, but also to look at the usability of
cryptosystems for implementers, because these are the two spots where
most mistakes are likely to be made. The latter hasn't had as much focus
AFAIK, but from what I've seen there's a growing focus on the problem of
"dev-proofing" in addition to "user-proofing".
That is a noble cause, and I applaud your efforts.

Not if the idea of duty for many is an eye to the bottom line. Also, I
would like to have doctors fixing things like intestinal ruptures, not
some kid with their parent's sewing kit :P
If we already have problems trying to keep religion out of schools, how
are you going to get HackEd into school? ;)
