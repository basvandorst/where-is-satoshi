Whether you're the human resources director of a 300-person             multi-discipline firm or the president of a 15-person firm who wears             many hats, establishing a consistent hiring process helps ensure             that your firm will be able to make those critical hires in a timely             manner. Learn             more...
2. AEC trends
            Coping with a recession
            After several years of speedy growth, the construction industry has             downshifted over the past year. Contractors who started their             businesses in recent years may be unprepared for the downturn.             Others who have been in business longer probably remember the last             major recession in the early 1990s, but may still be caught             off-guard by a sudden drop in business.
