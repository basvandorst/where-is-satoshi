Hello Steve,
 > Fwd: cryptography e$
I am one of the lead developers of Credentica, which is Stefan Brands'
latest venture after his amicable departure from ZKS quite some time
ago. We are exclusively focused on the development of identity and
access management technology based on Stefan's Digital Credential work.
Following our closing of investment from Nokia earlier this year, we
started with the design and implementation of a Software Development
Toolkit for Digital Credentials. We are exploring the idea of releasing
parts of it under an open-source license, and intend to post updates
here from time to time on our progress. More information will be
available on our upcoming Web site, which should be up soon.
Meanwhile, if you are interested in getting a glimpse of what we are doing, check out Stefan's keynote materials at a recent NIST PKI workshop, which you can find here: Kind regards,
Christian Paquin
Cryptographic Developer
