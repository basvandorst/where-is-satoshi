I didn't say that it wasn't possible to secure logos. I said that
you couldn't protect people who trusted logos that were transmitted
to them in Web pages. This is not the same thing. The point is
that such logos are transmitted in-band and are part of the web
page. Therefore, they are not cryptographically verified.

So? This would be exactly the case if the certificate were
issued to Palm rather than Modus. VeriSign's procedures ensure
(one hopes) that only someone authorized by Palm could have
gotten this certificate, thus cutting out the middleman
of the extra certificate. Aside from inflexibility, I don't
see any problem with the security guarantees this provides.
No possible security system can protect people who trust
whatever logo happens to be transmitted to them in web pages.

The certificates say EXACTLY that. They say that this entity is authorized to use the domain name store.palm.com.

This is confused. What sells certificates is "security". Users
aren't sophisticated enough to understand the difference between
confidentiality and authentication, but they've been told by
the browser manufacturers (rightly) that in order to have security
they need to have certificates.
Saying that SSL without certificates is fine as long as you
don't have active attacks is kind of like saying that leaving
your front door open is fine as long as noone tries to break
This is essentially the PGP model. It doesn't really work acceptably
for large scale e-commerce.
Since when? As far as I know, Microsoft and Netscape just send you
to VeriSign.
It certainly isn't true that you need a "major client browser development
kit" to engage in e-commerce. You can do just fine with ApacheSSL or
mod_ssl. You do generally need a certificate.
Both DNS and whois can be spoofed by an active attacker.

These are inextricably connected. If you want to know that
your communications are private in the face of active attack
you need to know who you're talking to as well.
How exactly does the difficulty of getting certificates help browser
What are you talking about? An nslookup call wouldn't help anything.
The essential problem is establishing that the public key you receive
over the network actually belongs to the person you think it does.
In the absence of a prior arrangement, the only way we know how
to do this is to have that binding vouched for by a third-party.

Right. My point is this:
Security people often argue that PKI is worthless on the grounds that
the CAs disclaim all liability. This argument leads to the conclusion
that security is essentially worthless since scurity software
almost invariably comes with a disclaimer of all liability.

In that case, why should the liability also apply to CAs, despite their

While this is true, I'd point out that all the security software
you're using disclaims any responsibility for not having gaping
security holes.

No. It means that your credit card info goes to people who have
been authorized to use the domain name "store.palm.com". The
certificate reflects that. This appears to be a case of Is your claim that Modus Media is NOT authorized to operate
"store.palm.com"?

@_subject: Blind signatures with DSA/ECDSA? 
Does anyone know if there is a blind signature scheme that works with
DSA or ECDSA? I know about Camenisch, Pivetau and Stadler's "Blind
Signatures Based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem" (1994), but as far
as I can tell that doesn't produce straight DSA-verifiable signatures
and so is a lot less desirable than it might otherwise be.
Has there been any better work on this?

Precisely. Moreover, you can presumably use fairly unsophisticated
data mining/fraud detection techniques to detect when a unit has
been cloned and then go back to the photographs to find and punish
the offenders.

@_subject: SHA-1 rumors 
Ed Felten's blog is carrying the rumor that a break in SHA-1
is going to be announced soon:
I've also done some off-the-cuff analysis of how bad this
would be in practice, which you can find here:
The key question is whether it's just collisions, which would
be embarassing, but which don't affect most applications, or
whether there is forward progress in finding preimages.
Anyone know anything about this rumor?
P.S. AFAIK, although Dobbertin was able to find preimages for
reduced MD4, there still isn't a complete break in MD4. Correct?

@_subject: MD5 collisions? 
Check out this ePrint paper, which claims to have collisions in
MD5, MD4, HAVAL, and full RIPEMD.
The authors claim that the MD5 attack took an hour for the first
collision and 15 seconds to 5 minutes for subsequent attacks
with the same first 512 bits.
