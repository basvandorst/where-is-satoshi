Probably he means cloudfare blocked the nazis, since with Tor you cannot
(in theory) block .onions up to now, just try to discover the real
location and seize the servers. thats what the 3 or 4 letter agencies
around world are doing for quite some time.
does anybody has any more info on this opennic? does they ever blocked any

Such a thing does not exist.
The closest I believe is the Lemote Yeelong.
"I am using a Lemote Yeelong, a netbook with a Loongson chip and a 9-inch
display. This is my only computer, and I use it all the time. I chose it
because I can run it with 100% free software even at the BIOS level."

TDS is not in line with my views, but indeed it is terrifying.
