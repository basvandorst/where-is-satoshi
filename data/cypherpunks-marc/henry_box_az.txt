@_subject: CAN YOU BE TRUSTED 
Attn: Dear,
I am  Henry Seely, before anything i ask if you can
be trusted, because one of my late friend deposited
the sum of US$7,000,000.00 in a Finance firm
in Europel, and i Called the Finance firm in order to be
sure if the said fund is still There, and the
Finance firm has assured me not to be worried about anything that all i needed is to forward to them my full banking information where the said fund will be transferred to, and i told them that my Late friend did a contract in your
country with you, that before his death, he wrote a well that the sum of US$7,000,000.00 should be transferred into your account.
Furthermore, all i needed from you is truth and
honest, because i don't want any delay in this
transaction, so as soon as you read my mail, do not
fail to reply me with your direct telephone and fax
number together with your full banking information so
it will enable me to forward it to the Finance firm for them
to notify you for onward transfer of the fund, for
your information, the sum of 30% will be for you, why
the balance 70% will be for me after the transferring
of the fund to your nominated Bank account.
Finally, i will be looking forward to read from you,
and please do not fail to reply on time, so the fund
can be transferred to you before the ending of this
Thanks and God bless.
Yours Henry Seely.
