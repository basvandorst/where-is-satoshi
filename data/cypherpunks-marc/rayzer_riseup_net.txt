I believe in many of these so-called attacks, when they're real ones,
the US plants bots on Chinese, Russian, computers that attack US
agencies, commercial institutions, etc, and steal the data for the US
intel community... One thing Snowden's doxdumps showed was the US LUVS
industrial espionage. Can stealing credit card and other personal data
for resale be off-limits then? The CIA and all the rest ARE WELL-KNOWN
for dealing with the Mafia and organized crime generally (because the US
government IS organized crime) Meanwhile the bots provide a convenient
alibi for the simple-minded, that Chinese or Russian computers are doing
it (so it must be their fault) and some of the less-useful dox are
dumped on the public.

Ummmn, so... He worked for Booz Allen in a national security sensitive

My dad coordinated tech writers for NASA Huntsville, US Army, in the
1960s, and was tasked with 'watching over'... including destruction of
the Mimeograph barrels after a dox run. Times do change.
Ps. The page has a little sidebar image "1811 did 9/11". It's nonsense

The guys (again, almost all men) who came before THEM are my folk
heroes. They were closer to hippies (Some WERE! Stewart Brand of Ken
Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, the Whole Earth Catalog, and then The
Well, one of the very first Internet communities). The OGs were more
like hobbyists. They WERE hobbyists. Forced out by the 'suits'.
You'll note that after they were all gone, no new ideas in computer
development. Just 'polishing the apple', miniaturization, speed and
flashier graphics. The people discussed here are the 'moneymen' who
eventually drove that element out.
Unfortunately they're totalitarian authoritarian and libertarian, and
they will NEVER leave unless they destroy their creations. Not a decent
coder in the batch either. Steve Jobs was a glorified Marketing Engineer
with hipster charisma. That's all it takes... Schmooze ... and as seen
with ioerror, lying and cutthroating for personal advantage.

@_subject: Apple at BlackHat: Reopening the "Going Dark" Debate (Lawfare) 
Just over a week ago, at the BlackHat hacker convention in Las Vegas,
Ivan KrstiÄ, Head of Security Engineering and Architecture at Apple gave
a talk entitled âBehind the scenes of iOS Security,â the slides of which
are available here.
Itâs a historic talk for a couple of reasons. First, Apple is
traditionally very secretive about how it technically does security on
its devices. Apple also announced its first bug bounty program. So far,
so newsworthy.
But something else happened at that talk. Unbeknownst to the presenter
or anybody in the audience, Apple just reopened the âGoing Darkâ dispute
between the FBI and the privacy community, and it turned the entire
dispute on its head. In the cold light of day, I suspect Apple, the US
government, and privacy activists are going to be rather unhappy when
they digest the sobering implications of the talk, though they will
likely be upset for entirely different reasons.
In short, Apple built the very thing that they and the privacy community
have been saying for years is reckless, dangerous or impossible: a
high-value encryption key secured in a vault such that the key canât be
stolen or misused by hackers or malicious insiders. And without a hint
of self-awareness Appleâs head of security engineering and architecture
went all the way to BlackHat in Las Vegas to boast about how they did it.
But Iâm getting ahead of myself. Letâs start at the beginning...

Whoever did this, U.S. says of latest hacks, were coming after you
With linkage @ Mcclatchy
By Tim Johnson
Top White House and Justice Department officials asked for patience from
the public Wednesday as they refused to say whether Russia or another
nation may be behind a new series of headline-grabbing hacks affecting
the realms of politics and sports.
But they promised that the hacks will not go unpunished  once they are
certain who is responsible for them.
Whether you are a rogue hacker or a uniformed soldier, the shadowy
corners of the internet will not provide respite for long, Attorney
General Loretta Lynch said.
A top Lynch deputy, John P. Carlin of the Justice Departments National
Security Division, said the Obama administration would go after whoever
was responsible, even if they were operating as part of a foreign
governments institutions.
The message should be clear: You are not safe because you are operating
under another nations flag, Carlin said. We can figure out who did
it. It wont remain anonymous.
The warnings came as the interim chair of the Democratic National
Committee, Donna Brazile, blamed agents in Russia for the release of new
hacked DNC documents that she said were intended to influence the
outcome of Novembers presidential election.
Theres one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and
thats Donald Trump, Brazile said in a statement. Not only has Trump
embraced (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, he publicly encouraged
further Russian espionage to help his campaign.
Whoever hacked the DNC, an act first reported in June, provided some
20,000 internal DNC emails to WikiLeaks, which released them a month
later. The hack has fueled concern that foreign cyber-agents might also
meddle directly in the November U.S. election.
Earlier this week, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported that its
database had been penetrated by a Russian espionage group, known as
Fancy Bear, that released information on four U.S. athletes  gymnast
Simone Biles, tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, and basketball
player Elena Delle Donne. The confidential medical data showed that the
four had used medicines that usually are banned but that may be used
with approval from the International Olympic Committee to treat certain
medical conditions. All four had received permission.
Hundreds of Russian athletes were barred from competing in last months
Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro due to suspicions of widespread
Lisa O. Monaco, President Barack Obamas top aide on homeland security
and counterterrorism, declined to blame Russia for the latest hacks but
said finger-pointing would come soon enough.
Folks should stay tuned, Monaco said at a forum at the Center for
Strategic & International Studies to honor the Justice Departments
Division of National Security.
We know Russia is a bad actor in cyberspace, just as China has been,
just as Iran has been, Monaco said. Nobody should think that there is
a free pass when youre conducting malicious cyber-activity.
Our reach is long, added Monaco, a former assistant attorney general.
Sometimes it takes a long time to build a case but it doesnt deter us
from pursuing it.
Lynch noted that U.S. prosecutors in 2014 had charged five members of
Chinas Peoples Liberation Army with hacking U.S. companies to benefit
Chinese industry. Last year, prosecutors charged seven Iranians,
allegedly linked to the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, with
planning to hack U.S. banks and a New York State dam in an attempt to
disrupt its operation.
Before the indictments of the Chinese army members, Carlin said, few
thought the U.S. government would seriously go after hackers linked to
foreign governments.
There was a period of time when folks said, Cyber-espionage, Chinese
espionage, theres nothing you can do about it. Its too hard. Theyre
going to be able to remain anonymous, and this is just the world we have
to accept as the status quo,  Carlin said.
But he said indictments against foreign hackers had proved otherwise.
For those who think that, be it Russia or any other country, that
theres going to be a free pass, that we cant figure out what they are
doing in cyber-enabled espionage, the message should be clear, he said.

The power elite (and yes that includes her shill the 1/2-elite Donald
Trump) have chosen her to be president. She manipulates the levers of
power and war in exactly the manner maximizing the ROI on whatever their
particular interest are. They want it to stay just... like... that.
Further, the resources gained via (diplomatic) power and war are getting
scarce, and due to the need for wars to acquire them, are also quite
expensive . Factories across the planet operate on JIT inventories of
many of those materials (oil, other extractive resources up the supply
chain), and disruption of that flow, even momentarily, threatens their
ROI and has the potential to cause continued disruptions. They can't
allow that, and Hillary knows it, so if she wants to manipulate those
levers they might literally 'work her to death' just getting to the
'levers'. She IS an employee, and the bennies are world class, so she does.
There are people (no more interested in shutting the MACHINE down than
Clinton) who would oppose that plan for her leadership of the US and
they will pounce on every opportunity to weaken her chances. Including
the fact that she's an old lady and the grueling business of
campaigning, no less running the MACHINE might be beyond her physical
capacity. My grandmother passed in 1967 from complications of
Pneumonia.She was just a couple of years older than Clinton is today,
and was not in bad health... Had rarely been to doctors previously.

Big Data Isnât Just Watching YouâItâs Making You Poorer
Cathy OâNeilâs new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, shows mathematical
models arenât free of ideology.
BY Pankaj Mehta, In These Times, Sept 6 2016
By some estimates, humanity now produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data
every dayâmore than a hundred times the amount of data in the entire
Library of Congress. This data ranges from Facebook posts to
military-grade satellite photos. Increasingly, this data is analyzed by
complex mathematical models that determine more and more aspects of our
lives, from the advertisements we see to whether we have access to
private insurance. Yet despite their growing importance, these models
often remain hidden.
Advocates of such mathematical modeling, in both the public and private
sectors, portray it as a neutral and efficient alternative to fallible
and biased human decision-making. Mathematician, data scientist and
popular blogger Cathy OâNeil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction: How
Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy, doesnât agree.
She argues that many mathematical models are ideological tools that
exacerbate oppression and inequality. Her examples range from the crime
models used by police departments to determine which neighborhoods to
patrol, to the recidivism models used by judges to hand out prison
OâNeil is passionate about exposing the harmful effects of Big
Dataâdriven mathematical models (what she calls WMDs), and sheâs
uniquely qualified for the task. She earned a Ph.D. in math from Harvard
and landed a tenure-track at Barnard. But she became bored with the pace
and insularity of academia, and left to work as a quantitative analyst
at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw. There, she had a front-row seat for the
2008 financial crisis.
This experience fundamentally changed OâNeilâs relationship to
mathematics. She realized that far from being a neutral object of study,
mathematics was not only âdeeply entangled in the worldâs problems but
also fueling many of them.â People in power were âdeliberately
[wielding] formulas to impress rather than clarify.â This
disillusionment led OâNeil to get involved with Occupy Wall Street and
start educating the public about the dangers of WMDs through her blog,
She is careful to point out that there is nothing inherently destructive
about mathematical modeling. Sophisticated data modeling enables much of
modern technology, from wireless communication to drug discovery. How
can one distinguish a destructive math model from an ordinary, or even
helpful, one? OâNeil identifies three key features of WMDs: lack of
transparency, lack of fairness and, most importantly, operation on a
massive scale.
OâNeil grounds her argument in case studies of WMDs in a variety of
settings: finance, higher education, the criminal justice system, online
advertising, employment decisions and scheduling, and credit and
insurance provision. The âvalue-addedâ model for teacher evaluation,
which looks at improvements in individual studentsâ test scoresâa
favorite of the so-called âeducational reformâ movementâis touted as an
objective measure of a teacherâs worth. Yet this is far from the truth.
OâNeil cites an analysis by blogger and educator Gary Rubinstein of New
Yorkâs 2010 value-added scores for public school teachers. OâNeil
explains that âOf teachers who taught the same subject in consecutive
years, one in four registered a 40-point difference. [This] suggests
that the evaluation data is practically random.â OâNeil argues that this
is because the value-added model, which relies on predictions of student
performance, suffers from a built-in logical flaw: No statistical model
can accurately make predictions about a class of 25 or 30 studentsâthe
sample size is too small. Yet the high-stakes testing regime continues
to wreak havoc on the trajectories of students and teachers alike.
Other WMDs, known as e-scores, use data such as ZIP codes, web-surfing
patterns and recent purchases to evaluate a personâs credit-worthiness.
Unlike the more familiar FICO credit scores that are freely available
and regulated by the government, these secretive e-scores are
âunaccountable, unregulated and often unfair.â Whereas FICO scores are
based on your own financial history, e-scores compare you to other
people with similar profiles. This may seem benign, but it can result in
feedback loops that reinforce existing social inequities. If you live in
a poor ZIP code, then your e-score will drop, meaning less credit and
higher interest ratesâessentially, an algorithmic redlining of the poor
and working class.

I alway check new twitter followers for bots and data mining. Especially
if they don't seem to be 'my type'. This turned up from a follow who was
sweeping for the word "market" and found it here:
 as a
tweet of a Le Monde Diplomatique link regarding the topic "If they're
going to take your data to market at you you should be getting paid for it"
MIT Technology Review:
Scientists at the Computational Story Laboratory have analyzed novels to
identify the building blocks of all stories.
by Emerging Technology from the arXiv July 6, 2016
Back in 1995, Kurt Vonnegut gave a lecture in which he described his
theory about the shapes of stories. In the process, he plotted several
examples on a blackboard. âThere is no reason why the simple shapes of
stories canât be fed into computers,â he said. âThey are beautiful
shapes.â The video is available on YouTube.
Vonnegut was representing in graphical form an idea that writers have
explored for centuriesâthat stories follow emotional arcs, that these
arcs can have different shapes, and that some shapes are better suited
to storytelling than others.
Vonnegut mapped out several arcs in his lecture. These include the
simple arc encapsulating âman falls into hole, man gets out of holeâ and
the more complex one of âboy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.â
Vonnegut is not alone in attempting to categorize stories into types,
although he was probably the first to do it in graphical form. Aristotle
was at it over 2,000 years before him, and many others have followed in
his footsteps.
However, there is little agreement on the number of different emotional
arcs that arise in stories or their shape. Estimates vary from three
basic patterns to more than 30. But there is little in the way of
scientific evidence to favor one number over another.
Today (ed. Here in the future... -Rr), that changes thanks to the work
of Andrew Reagan at the Computational Story Lab at the University of
Vermont in Burlington and a few pals. These guys have used sentiment
analysis to map the emotional arcs of over 1,700 stories and then used
data-mining techniques to reveal the most common arcs. âWe find a set of
six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex
narratives,â they say.

You cant talk about discriminatory design without mentioning city
planner Robert Moses, whose public works projects shaped huge swaths of
New York City from the 1930s through the 1960s. The physical design of
the environment is a powerful tool when its used to exclude and isolate
specific groups of people. And Moses design choices have had lasting
discriminatory effects that are still felt in modern New York.
A notorious example: Moses designed a number of Long Island Parkway
overpasses to be so low that buses could not drive under them. This
effectively blocked Long Island from the poor and people of color who
tend to rely more heavily on public transportation..."

Something Paul Goodman, founder of Gestalt Therapy and Anarchist said to

"...speaking by invitation to the National Security Industrial
Association âa consortium of arms manufacturers at the October 1967
âResearch and Development in the 1970s.â symposium, Washington DC:
    âYou are the military industrial [complex] of the United States, the
most dangerous body of men at present in the world, for you not only
implement our disastrous policies but are an overwhelming lobby for
them, and you expand and rigidify the wrong use of brains, resources,
and labor so that change becomes difficult.â
    (He continued as the audience sat in stunned silence.)
    âThe best service you people could perform is rather rapidly to
phase yourselves out, passing on your relevant knowledge to people
better qualified, or reorganizing yourselves with entirely different
sponsors and commitments, so that you learn to think and feel in a
different way.
    Since you are most of the R&D [research and development] that there
is, we cannot do without you as people, but we cannot do with you as you
    (laughter and booing along with scattered applause)
    âbut we believe, however, that that way of life is unnecessary,
ugly, and un-American.â
    (Shouts from the audience: âWho are âweâ?â)
    âWe are I and those people outside âwe cannot condone your present
operations; they should be wiped off the slate.â

development is USELESS to anyone but the 'war machine' if it's all about

least, the competence not to do that and have some sort of

Ps. Daddy Semi-truck-driver used to 'sign off on sonny boy's Class A
Tractor license and that was good enough for most states. There were
literally thousands of truck drivers in the US who didn't know how to
adjust tractor-trailer brakes which, until the last decade or so,  had
to be adjusted manually or... Let me put it this way if you're
mechanically minded, there a shaft going into the drum with an S-shaped
cam on it that pushes the the backs of the brake shoes out. If you don't
adjust the 'slacks' the cam spins without touching the backs of the
shoes and the brakes? They don't work!
I want truck drivers to prove they know how to adjust their brakes.
In nation-states? Absolutely not.
I don't believe in national borders. You're confused.

COINTELPRO was the NYPD "Bureau of Special Services" aka Red Squad
getting my name off the blotter after a guerrilla theater protest (Ted K
shortly after Chappaquidick and NY Senator Abe Ribicoff) at NYU's Queens
campus and using the file cabinet/phonecall/whoknowswheretheygotitfrom
info to threaten my dad's US Army/NASA security clearance.
What fun. Everyone should experience that sort of institutional attack
because they're a 16 year old antiwar protester.... Captain Finnegan's
thugs (We called him "The Silver Fox b/c hair color and he looked a lot
like whathisname from the A Team... really.) were already at the demos
photographing protesters and singling people out for 'special
treatment'. The unit was eventually disbanded after grand jury hearings
about it's abuses. Right. Sure.
The group I was involved in ended up having three or four police agents,
informers, freelancing john birchers... including the group's
photographer. One of them was the snitch who put Sam Melville in Attica.
COINTELPRO was a REAL Barrel o' laughs... Unless ofc you were Fred
Hampton, or a number of other folks the US government simply had

Red Flora, Rote Flora, Hamburg Germany. A whole anarchist neighborhood
and community center that's existed for years. Three years ago they
stood the government down, with assistance coming from all over Europe.
Second World War. Masked protesters torched cars and showered police
with stones, bottles and fireworks. The police responded with water
cannon, baton charges and tear gas. More than 120 police officers and an
estimated 500 demonstrators were injured, many of them badly.
Just days later, another group of protesters assaulted police with
stones and bottles as they were leaving the Davidwache station in what
was apparently an unprovoked attack."
Ps. Red Flora still stands. Unlike prog-lib protests and squats, because
there's a HUGE BASE OF SUPPORT in German society.

That's when he saw "Hippies" and set about turning people who were
pretty much hedonists and apolitical, into hard core antiwar
anti-imperialist activists, with humor. He scammed the YMCA into paying
the lease on the Cooper Square Free Store where he organized for Chicago

You're right in there with Juan, in some philosophically perfect

Peer Review is the main root of the ignorance I see in Academia. Modern

indoctrination, and peer-review enforces a situation where only vetted

Sociopolitical beliefs inculcated in those minds that make them conform

the marketing end of the internet wide open in a latter day "Gold Rush"

was always an adult there to help me out with complex concepts (and
violence... "Racket Squad, The Untouchables, and Highway Patrol were
just as bloody as a modern war movie).
Later in their history teevees became babysitters with no adult
attending. It does make a difference to have an adult nearby watching
teevee with you if you're a child, and not just a chronological adult
which is what many are now days after being babysat by teevee until they
were terminally 'dumbed' and numbed.

bother looking. Their insurance, or 'upgrade plan' resolves it. I waited
THREE FUCKING MONTHS for the owner to call and claim, but they never
did. So I had it turned on in my name.
But the idea of sending more than the most mundane stuff to the
intertubz on it never seemed wise.

Regarding the number of Jews killed. Every official authority including
Russian sources estimate the number of dead between 4-8 million.
There's a lot of variance because of HOW it's decided whether the deaths
were related to Nazi government action or not. It will NEVER be totally
settled, so most just uses the 6 million number.
As a more recent example there's dispute over the number of Iraqis
killed by the US for similar reasons. International law holds that the
invader is responsible for securing the invaded space and is responsible
for all deaths including civilian on civilian murder etc.
The US, ofc, doesn't buy that, or that they're responsible for the mass
fratricide they cause arming ethnic groups against each other for it's
own purposes. So the numbers will vary.
As a Jew, what I don't want to see are Jews denying there were/are
holocausts happening just as tragic every moment we're alive and for
some reason the Nazi holocaust was somehow worse than, lets say, what
the US did, is doing, to the indigenous people.
Many Jews think like that. Ours is the only Holocaust. As my Bessarabian
grandpa, chased across the region by the Bishkek pogroms of the late
1800s(?)  would have said "Ishkabibble". Yiddish slang for nonsense, and
the people pushing that POV on Jews HAVE an agenda, and funding for it
from Zionists who hope the international community will let them have
their way with Palestinians 'b/c holocaust'.

I'm going to say it again. Tor is barely passable if you're going to

it's no longer even passable. I'd trust twitter DM before I'd trust
Cloudflare. At least they demand a court order and resist orders they
think are bogus. Cloudflare... HAve they ever publicly stated any info
regarding court orders? I'm not seeing it.
But you never know it until you're in prison or dead, and you'd STILL
never find out about it. In court discovery motions the prosecutor would
claim their source is DHS-affiliated and to name it would cause problems
catching terrorists or some other bullshit, and a judge WILL buy that.

The law of the land is you have to identify yourself. You don't have to
produce papers unless you're operating a vehicle. Even then you don't
have to produce, but you'll get a fixit ticket for not having it with you.
OTOH, things can be 'different you're POC, homeless or poor... For
instance a homeless friend of mine was given a camping ticket last
winter. In the process the officer asked for his ID.
He informed the cop it was buried away for the night but he knew his
*Identification Number*. The cop told him that wasn't good enough, to
give him his *social security number*. My friend explained that was a
violation of US federal law... The number is SPECIFICALLY forbidden from
being used as general identification and it said so right on the card
... and the cop wouldn't want him to commit a federal crime, now would he?
The cop then said something truly chilling that went something like this:
This is the middle of the winter in a town where it can go to freezing
in the early morning.
My friend complied, under duress, and he wrote that on the ticket too. A
ticket that never got filed.
Postlogue: I did a check for my friend and found that if you don't have
identification information for a non-jailable offense (ie. infractions
in California) the solution is simple. A thumb-print on the ticket to
simply prove you were there. Every cop has a print kit in their car.
My friend said he was going to sue for privacy violation but never did.
It ain't easy being broke and houseless and trying to file a state level
civil rights suit on your own. I suspect they wanted his social security
number for a database of local homeless.

In the original piece he spells out in great detail how the outcasts of

cooperative societies ejecting the non-cooperative members.

anything to do with ideology,
There's an ideological difference between communism and capitalism.
Ideally communism should mean the elimination of greed as a driving
force in a society. Including greed for power.
However, as you described, the "American Revolution" was simply a
'transfer of pwnership of the levers of greed' from the Crown to rich
white men settlers by partially force, and partially the isolation from
Britain that made it simply too costly to pursue a full occupation, and
perhaps forced removal of their errant subjects.
If Britain wanted to, it could have sailed an armada into Boston Harbor
and leveled the whole city. They didn't. There's a whole bunch of other
things they could have done, including paying the Natives, whose toes

Guns make it so. Law enforcement owns about 99.9% of all the military
style weaponry.
Have you ever seen this bit In 1776, when the height of military technology was a musket and a
cannon, both of which you could make by melting down church bells, there
might have been something to it. When the contest was little more than
numbers of guns you could drag through the woods, and how to play the
weather, the government probably did need to worry a bit about
insurrection  and that might have kept them a bit more honest.
However, the first time someone tried that kind of thing, it didn't work
out so well. In fact, Shays' Rebellion just led to Constitutional tweaks
to make the federal government that much stronger. The Civil War led to
even more, with harsher consequences.
If 13 states, with the assistance of at least one superpower, didn't
manage to get their way through armed insurrection, what the hell makes
anyone think that armed insurgency is going to preserve our right to 
whatever  not have affordable health care, or to coffee cups that say
"Happy Birthday Jesus" on them?
Ok, fine lets come up with a cause worth fighting for.
Lets say that Obama refuses to step down in 2016, and he not only
declares himself dictator-for-life, but he also starts dressing like
Ghadaffi, decrees that the national religion shall be Islam, the
national language will be Klingon, there will be an efficient rail
network in the United States, the writ of Prima Noctae is now in effect,
and there shall be martial law to enforce all of the above, as well as
any other laws that the President invents, on a daily basis.
We managed to preserve our right to keep military grade rifles and
machine guns, so we all muster down on the Town Common with our guns.
We tried voting.
We tried protesting.
This is a reasonable time to start with the armed insurrection stuff.
So, you, me, all our neighbors, hell our entire city builds a perimeter
around it. We fill sandbags, we all have ammunition, we all have food,
water, supplies, and most importantly, we are all unified and in
complete solidarity.
And we stand there, resisting whatever it is the government was going to
do to us.
And then they fly over with one jet, dropping one FAE bomb, and roll in
with three tanks, and in about 12 hours, our "resistance" is reduced to
a few smoking holes.
The Tree of Liberty will get its manure all right, but it will be the
manure that you shat out as you ran for cover, as long range artillery
rains down on our town, as we get carpet bombed from 35,000 feet, and as
the sky goes black with drones and cruise missiles.
We're screwed.
So if the 2nd Amendment's "right to revolution" implication is real,
both practically and legally, it must also include a right to possess
tanks, jets, rocket launchers, etc.
Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our
volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft
batteries, maybe a submarine or two?
Oh, you can't afford that?
That's ok, we have some patriotic citizens who can.
The same billionaires who already own the government, that's who.
So what do they want to "resist?"
I could only see them wanting to resist checks on their own power.
So, if the Second Amendment implies a right to resist the government,
then that would mean that we need our billionaire friends to start
stockpiling these weapons now. We need a Koch brothers airfield with a
few fighters and bombers, and Adelson should have a fleet of tanks
somewhere, and I guess that George Soros would bring his collection of
nuke-armed submarines up to date, right?
So lets drop the crazy scenario of Obama-cum-Ghadaffi, and just think
about something we were really likely to see upset us. Do you think for
a moment that you, living in some apartment in Salt Lake City, or a
house in Wyoming, or a condo in Boca Raton, would be ready to go to war
with the Federal Government over the same shit that would get the Koch
Brothers to fuel up their private stock of A10 Warthogs? Really?
Because you know what the billionaires want the government to stop doing?
They want it to get out of the way of their becoming trillionaires.
If you think that the Second Amendment means what the Supreme Court said
in Heller, and you believe that is a good thing, because it gives you
the ability to resist the government, you might want to play out the
long game in your head.
The long game here is this interpretation leads to private armies,
raised by limitless wealth, all of which looks at our quaint little
republican form of government as nothing more than a paper justification
to have a flag waving over a few national parks."

The Bundy Boiz acquitted of "Conspiracy to impede federal officers
through intimidation, threats or force".
Oregon militants acquitted of conspiracy in wildlife refuge seizure
By Scott Bransford
PORTLAND, Ore. A federal court jury delivered a surprise verdict on
Thursday acquitting anti-government militant leader Ammon Bundy and six
followers of conspiracy charges stemming from their role in the armed
takeover of a wildlife center in Oregon earlier this year.
The outcome marked a stinging defeat for federal prosecutors and law
enforcement in a trial the defendants sought to turn into a pulpit for
airing their opposition to U.S. government control over millions of
acres of public lands in the West.
Bundy and others, including his brother and co-defendant Ryan Bundy,
cast the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a
patriotic act of civil disobedience. Prosecutors called it a lawless
scheme to seize federal property by force.
Jubilant supporters of the Bundys thronged the courthouse after the
verdict, hailing the trial's outcome as vindication of a political
ideology that is profoundly distrustful of federal authority and
challenges its legitimacy.
"We're so grateful to the jurors who weren't swayed by the nonsense that
was going on," defendant Shawna Cox told reporters. "God said we weren't
guilty. We weren't guilty of anything."
As the seven-week-long trial in the U.S. District Court in Portland
climaxed, U.S. marshals wrestled to the floor Ammon Bundy's lawyer,
Marcus Mumford, as he argued heatedly with the judge over the terms of
his client's continued detention.
The Bundys still face assault, conspiracy and other charges from a
separate armed standoff in 2014 at the Nevada ranch of their father,
Cliven Bundy, triggered when federal agents seized his cattle for his
failure to pay grazing fees for his use of public land.
The outcome of the Oregon trial clearly shocked many in the packed
courtroom. Attorneys exchanged looks of astonishment with the
defendants, then hugged their clients as the not-guilty verdicts were
read amid gasps from spectators.
Outside the courthouse, supporters celebrated by shouting "Hallelujah"
and reading passages from the U.S. Constitution. One man rode his horse,
named Lady Liberty, in front of the courthouse carrying an American flag.
The verdict came after four days of deliberations. One juror, a former
federal employee, was dismissed over questions of bias on Wednesday and
replaced by a substitute.
The 12-member panel found all seven defendants - six men and a woman -
not guilty of the most serious charge, conspiracy to impede federal
officers through intimidation, threats or force. That charge alone
carried a maximum penalty of six years in prison.
The defendants also were acquitted of illegal possession of firearms in
a federal facility and theft of government property, except in the case
of Ryan Bundy, for whom jurors were deadlocked on the charge of theft.
The takeover of the wildlife refuge was initially sparked by outrage
over the plight of two imprisoned Oregon ranchers the occupiers believed
had been unfairly treated in an arson case. But the militants said they
were also protesting larger grievances at what they saw as government
The standoff led to the shooting death of one protester, Robert "LaVoy"
Finicum, by police shortly after the Bundy brothers were arrested, and
left parts of the refuge badly damaged.
More than two dozen people, in all, have been criminally charged in the
occupation, and a second group of defendants is due to stand trial in
Mumford told reporters he believed Ammon and Ryan Bundy would remain in
custody for the time being but may be transferred to Nevada.
Four co-defendants were free on their own recognizance during the trial.
A fifth, David Fry, the last of the occupiers to surrender in February,
was released hours after the verdict.

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Search_Risk_=e2=80=93_How_Google_Almost_Killed_ProtonMail?= 
In the past two months, many of you have reached out to us to ask about
the mysterious tweets we sent to Google in August. At ProtonMail,
transparency is a core value, and we try to be as transparent with our
community as possible. As many people have continued to point out to us,
we need to be more transparent here to avoid continued confusion and
speculation. Thus, we are telling the full story today to clarify what
What Happened?
The short summary is that for nearly a year, Google was hiding
ProtonMail from search results for queries such as âsecure emailâ and
âencrypted emailâ. This was highly suspicious because ProtonMail has
long been the worldâs largest encrypted email provider.
When ProtonMail launched in Beta back in May 2014, our community rapidly
grew as people from around the world came together and supported us in
our mission to protect privacy in the digital age. Our record breaking
crowdfunding campaign raised over half a million dollars from
contributors and provided us with the resources to make ProtonMail
competitive against even the biggest players in the email space.
By the summer of 2015, ProtonMail passed half a million users and was
the worldâs most well known secure email service. ProtonMail was also
ranking well in Google search at this time, on the first or second page
of most queries including âencrypted emailâ and âsecure emailâ. However,
by the end of October 2015, the situation had changed dramatically, and
ProtonMail was mysteriously no longer showing up for searches of our two
main keywords.
Between the beginning of the summer and the fall of 2015, ProtonMail did
undergo a lot of changes. We released ProtonMail 2.0, we went fully open
source, we launched mobile apps in beta, and we updated our website,
changing our TLD from .ch to the more widely known .com. We also doubled
in size, growing to nearly 1 million users by the fall. All of these
changes should have helped ProtonMailâs search rankings as we became
more and more relevant to more people.
In November 2015, we became aware of the problem and consulted a number
of well known SEO experts. None of them could explain the issue,
especially since ProtonMail has never used any blackhat SEO tactics, nor
did we observe any used against us. Mysteriously, the issue was entirely
limited to Google, as this anomaly was not seen on any other search
engine. Below are the search rankings for ProtonMail for âsecure emailâ
and âencrypted emailâ taken at the beginning of August 2016 across all
major search engines. We rank on either page 1 or 2 everywhere except
Google where we are not ranked at all.
image: protonmail seo rankings
All throughout Spring 2016, we worked in earnest to get in touch with
Google. We created two tickets on their web spam report form explaining
the situation. We even contacted Googleâs President EMEA Strategic
Relationships, but received no response nor improvement. Around this
time, we also heard about the anti-trust action brought forward by the
European Commission against Google, accusing Google of abusing its
search monopoly to lower the search rankings of Google competitors. This
was worrying news, because as an email service that puts user privacy
first, we are the leading alternative to Gmail for those looking for
better data privacy.
In August, with no other options, we turned to Twitter to press our
case. This time though, we finally got a response, thanks in large part
to the hundreds of ProtonMail users who drew attention to the issue and
made it impossible to ignore. After a few days, Google informed us that
they had âfixed somethingâ without providing further details. The
results could be immediately seen.

ProtonMail Google Search Ranking for âEncrypted Emailâ
In the above plots, the x-axis is time and the y-axis is search ranking
(lower number is better). The dates where there are no data points are
times when we are not ranked at all by Google. After Google made some
changes, ProtonMailâs rankings immediately recovered and are now ranked
 and  for âsecure emailâ and âencrypted emailâ respectively. Without
any additional explanation from Google, we may never know why ProtonMail
become unranked. In any case, we do appreciate Google finally taking
action to resolve the issue, we just wished it happened sooner.
The Danger of Search Risk
This incident however highlights a previously unrecognized danger that
we are now calling Search Risk. The danger is that any service such as
ProtonMail can easily be suppressed by either search companies, or the
governments that control those search companies. This can happen even
across national borders. For example, even though Google is an American
company, it controls over 90% of European search traffic. In this case,
Google directly caused ProtonMailâs growth rate worldwide to be reduced
by over 25% for over 10 months.
This meant that ProtonMailâs income from users was also cut by 25%,
putting financial pressure on our operations. We went from being able to
cover all our monthly expenses to having to draw from our emergency
reserve fund. The lost income and financial damage incurred as a result
was several hundred thousand Swiss Francs (1 CHF = 1.01 USD), which will
never be reimbursed.
The only reason we survived to tell this story is because the majority
of ProtonMailâs growth comes from word of mouth, and our community is
too loud to be ignored. Many other companies wonât be so fortunate. This
episode illustrates that Search Risk is serious, which is why we now
agree with the European Commission that given Googleâs dominant position
in search, more transparency and oversight is critical.

101 Ways I Screwed Up Making a Fake Identity
Posted on October 13, 2016 by hacks4pancakes	
As most of you know, my professional area of expertise in security is
incident response, with an emphasis on system / malware forensics and
OSINT. Iâm fortunate enough in my position in the security education and
con community to sometimes get pulled into other directions of blue
teaming and the occasional traditional penetration testing. However, the
rarest of those little fun excursions are into the physical pen testing
and social engineering realm. In the breaking into buildings and
pretending to be a printer tech realm, Iâm merely a hobbyist.ð
Therefore, it was a bit remarkable that in the course of developing some
training, there was a request for me to create some fake online personas
that would hold up against moderately security savvy users. I think most
of us have created an online alter ego to some extent, but these needed
to be pretty comprehensive to stand up to some scrutiny. Just making an
email account wasnât going to cut it.
So Pancakes went on an adventure into Backstop land. And made a lot of
amusing mistakes and learned quite a few things on the way. Iâll share
some of them here, so the social engineers can have a giggle and offer
suggestions in the comments, and the other hobbyists can learn from my
mistakes. Yes, there are automated tools that will help you do this if
you have to do it in bulk for work, but many of the problems still
exist. (Please keep in mind that misrepresenting yourself on these
services can cause your account to be suspended or banned, so if youâre
doing more than academic security  education or research, do cover your
legal bases.)

Interpreting Data About ISIS Online
Oct 6, 2016
Challenging ISIS has little to do with their number of followers, or the
decline in their number of messages. This type of tactical-level data
can indicate success, but genuine impact can only occur with robust
interpretation of data at the strategic level.
Recent studies have been used to claim success in reducing the number of
followers and volume of ISIS content on social media. Reports which
appear to show decline are seized on and used by many of the Public
Diplomacy and Information Operations strategies deployed against ISIS,
which seek opportunities to highlight failures and losses of the group.
Yet it is equally clear that, despite increasing efforts by western
governments and social media providers to counter ISIS online, ISIS
continues to produce and disseminate large quantities of
ideologically-inspired audio visual content and information. Equally,
individuals who have never had direct contact with the group commit acts
of violence in their name.
As such, it is often the case that the detail tells a different story
than some of the claims made about the data, specifically that ISIS is
experiencing a decline in followers and content on Twitter.<
Decline in the Number of Twitter Followers
The decline in the number of followers is frequently cited by those
seeking to emphasize success against ISIS. Iâve written previously about
the significant problems in the data collection and analysis in one of
the frequently cited studies. Even so, this study is cited as showing a
decline in follower numbers, despite actually concluding that
âsuspensions held the size and reach of the overall network flat, while
devastating the reach of specific users who have been repeatedly targeted.â
Claims of success against an adversary must account for fluctuations in
said adversaryâs tactics.
Social media platforms are fundamentally social networks. The metrics
about followers which Twitter produces are accurate for an individual
account, but cannot simply be aggregated to show the total number of
followers in a specific network. If number of followers is aggregated,
it will likely produce wildly inflated numbers for reach, and equally
overstate the decline in ISIS social media.
The falling follower fallacy is demonstrated in the image below. In it,
the same nodes are shown connected in different configurations, similar
to the three types or topologies John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt
highlighted in their discussion of Netwar.
Reading left to right, the different layouts demonstrate that:
    Aggregating follower numbers inflates the number of accounts that
appear to be in the network.
    The decline in aggregated follower numbers cannot be read as showing
decline in the number of accounts in the network.
    The decline in aggregated follower numbers cannot be used to show
that the network is being disrupted.
Ultimately, the Twitter strategy is to disseminate content, not gather
followers. In fact, distributing content rather than gaining followers
is the stated objective within ISIS networks, and as shown here, this is
entirely possible despite declining aggregate follower numbers..."

You know what they say about the market. When everyone is getting in,

WASHINGTON - Want a career with zero chances of going jobless?
Try the booming field of cybersecurity. Companies canât hire fast
enough. In the United States, companies report 209,000 cybersecurity
jobs that are in need of filling.
Itâll only get worse. By 2019, according to the Cybersecurity Jobs
Report, the workforce shortfall may reach 1.5 million. Globally, the
shortage could hit 6 million, it added.
âThe internet is growing faster than the growth of people to protect
it,â said Michael Kaiser, chief executive of the National Cyber Security
It is a problem with the full attention of the White House, which in
July called for âimmediate and broad-sweeping actions to address the
growing workforce shortage and establish a pipeline of well-qualified
cybersecurity talent.â
A dramatic rise in cybercrime has put government in competition with
private companies for hiring cybersecurity experts. Private companies
recoil at the possibility of hackers stealing their proprietary
information, holding their data for ransom or plundering their servers
of the personal information of clients.
The shortage in job candidates is not an easy or quick problem to
address, experts said.
âIt takes a long time to develop the instincts to be an effective
cybersecurity engineer. You canât just come out of college and know what
to do,â said David Foote, a tech industry researcher and co-founder of
Foote Partners of Vero Beach, Florida.
âThe threat landscape changes all the time, and thatâs hard to train
for,â Kaiser added.
Foote said both government and private industry faced shortages: âIn the
short term, itâs not looking good. There are so many employers who are
way behind in staffing.â
Efforts to poach cybersecurity experts occur at a blistering pace.
Some 46 percent of working cybersecurity professionals said they
received solicitations for other jobs âat least once per week,â
according to the State of Cyber Security Professional Careers, a survey
released last month jointly by the Enterprise Strategy Group and
Information Systems Security Association.
âTurnover in the cybersecurity ranks could represent an existential risk
to organizations in lower-paying industries like academia, health care,
the public sector and retail,â the survey said.
In the federal governmentâs push to expand cybersecurity training, it
has targeted all levels of education, including $125 million in National
Science Foundation grants to primary and secondary schools. It has also
designated nearly 200 colleges and universities as National Centers of
Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense.
Many universities are gearing up programs to meet the surge in demand.
âWe will start teaching the first group of students in two weeks,â said
Alan M. Usas, the director of the new executive masterâs in
cybersecurity program at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
âInterest has been extremely high.â
But luring younger students into cybersecurity can be a tough sell.
âPeople who are graduating from college are looking for the next killer
app or to create the next startup,â said Katrina Timlin, an associate
fellow in the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Cybersecurity has little of the cachet of other areas of information
technology, such as machine learning, and cybersecurity experts arenât
even always loved at their own companies. Their departments are not
revenue generators. And their constant efforts to penetrate systems can
raise hackles.
âThey have to have that nonconformist edge where they can pick apart a
problem. That kind of personality pushes some peopleâs buttons,â Timlin
As they look for flaws in existing networks and systems, cybersecurity
experts can find themselves at loggerheads with technology engineers who
built the systems, she said.
Cybersecurity encompasses far more than just technology issues.
âMost every company that has an internet presence by definition is a
global company,â Usas said. When hacks occur, âthereâs forensic work
that needs to be done,â he added, but often legal and policy issues come
into play, as well as human behavior analysis.
âThere are a number of straight deep tech jobs, but there are also a
number of hybrid jobs,â Foote said, noting that computer hacks can
affect accounting and finance divisions, as well as logistics, marketing
and legal affairs.
Those who are already established in cybersecurity and leading teams at
companies are well-compensated.
âThere is some talk out there, Iâve heard it, that lead software
security engineers are making $230,000 and $240,000 a year. Itâs crazy,â
said Foote.
Footeâs consulting firm receives compensation data from 2,914 employers
who report on what they pay 255,650 full-time technology professionals.
In the most recent quarter, Foote said, the firm found an average salary
of $99,000 for a cyber security specialist with three yearsâ experience
in design, deployment and administration of security systems. For a more
senior employee with at least five years of experience and strong
knowledge of digital controls and protection strategies, the national
average salary is $118,000.
Cybersecurity jobs in the United States pay an average of $6,500 more
than other information technology professions, a premium of 9 percent,
according to a July report, Hacking the Skills Shortage, by Intel
Security and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

It describes the US Strategic Hamlet program in Vietnam and it was used

like his, and neither did they ... He was a black man.
But even that boo-boo, which by the way nothing became of in court, just

The Military-Civil Society Suppression Interface - âThe Other Side Of
The Coin: Counterinsurgency And Community Policingâ
Kirsten Williams
This essay outlines the current counterinsurgency model, with an
emphasis on its domestic application in the United States. It shows that
many contemporary counterinsurgency practices were developed by police
agencies inside the U.S., and illustrates the transfer of theory,
strategy, and technique from domestic police to the military - and back.
The essay also examines the stateâs use of nongovernmental or nonprofit
agencies, as one element of counterinsurgency strategy, to channel and
control political opposition. [emphasis mine -RR] The conclusion briefly
considers the strategic implications for social movements, especially as
we learn to recognize and respond to political repression.
Introduction: Expect Repression
The goal is to create enough fear and anger to cause the leaders to

By Tim Johnson [email redacted]
Civil and human rights groups issued denunciations and some
cybersecurity experts urged their clients to stop using the popular
Yahoo Mail service after a news agency reported Tuesday that the
internet service provider had secretly scanned hundreds of millions of
clients emails at the behest of U.S. intelligence agencies.
The report by the Reuters news service said Yahoo complied with a
classified U.S. government directive last year that demanded that it
scan all incoming emails of its users for certain phrases. The report
said Yahoos engineers wrote a program that complied with the blanket
spying request.
Enough is enough. Its time to close your Yahoo account, Graham
Cluley, a British cybersecurity expert, tweeted following the report.
The report was the second piece of challenging news in recent days for
the Sunnyvale, California, company as it attempts to finalize a $4.8
billion sale of its core business to Verizon. On Sept. 22, Yahoo
acknowledged that the passwords of 500 million Yahoo account holders had
been stolen.
Yahoo did not immediately respond to the Reuters report. A chief rival
for global email, Alphabet Inc.s Google, said it had not been
approached by the intelligence agencies.
Weve never received such a request, but if we did, our response would
be simple: No way,  Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said in a
statement posted online.
Another large tech firm, Twitter, also weighed in, but without
clarifying whether it had received a directive aimed at intercepting
Federal law prohibits us from answering your question, and were

information about government requests, Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler said

at the U.S. government, saying its request had undermined trust in the

type of general, suspicionless search that the Fourth Amendment was
intended to prohibit, said Patrick Toomey, an attorney for the American

counting on technology companies to stand up to novel spying demands in
The alleged Yahoo collaboration with intelligence agencies caused
turmoil in the upper ranks of the company, the Reuters report said, and
led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer
Alex Stamos.
Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer bypassed the companys security team
and went to engineers to write the program to siphon off emails in real
time for the government, it added.
Stamos, who is now the chief security officer for Facebook, offered no
immediate comment on the report. The federal government also did not
Amnesty International, a London-based rights group, lamented what it
called the eroding privacy of internet users and efforts by the U.S.
government to indiscriminately vacuum up the worlds data.
This is a clear sign that people can trust neither their government nor
their service providers to respect their privacy: Only end-to-end
encryption that keeps their communications away from prying eyes will
do, said Amnestys Sherif Elsayed-Ali, the head of technology and human
Yahoo has gotten into hot water before for collaborating with government
requests  in China. More than a decade ago, it shared information with
the Chinese government that allowed for the jailing of two dissidents,
one of whom, Wang Xiaoning, spent a decade in jail. The other dissident,
Shi Tao, served a shorter sentence.
Yahoos partial sale to Verizon is already facing uncertainty over the
massive data breach, which took place in 2014. Yahoo apparently did not
inform Verizon of the breach, and news of it came out only last month
when Yahoo user data was offered for sale on the black market.
Legal advocates said they expected Congress to be uneasy over Tuesdays
If Yahoo is indeed scanning the content of all of its customers emails
at the NSAs behest, that would appear to violate the Fourth Amendment,
said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York
University School of Law.
Its also a violation of customers privacy and trust. Its disturbing
to learn that the NSA was secretly expanding its surveillance reach at
the very same time Congress was attempting to rein it in, added
Goitein, who is co-director of the centers Liberty and National
Security Program.
Privacy has been a major issue in Washington since former NSA and CIA
contractor Edward Snowden leaked top-secret information about National
Security Agency monitoring of Americans email and cellphone use in
2013. Congress ended one formerly secret program after the revelations.
The issue of privacy also pitted the FBI against the tech giant Apple
after the FBI sought to force Apple to circumvent security settings on a
phone that had been used by one of the killers at a holiday party last
year in San Bernardino, California. Apple refused a judges order that
it do so. The impasse was resolved when the FBI allowed a company that
said it had developed a way to bypass the security settings to hack into
the phone.
Not surprisingly, Snowden, who now lives in Russia, was among those
urging Yahoo Mail clients to abandon the service. Use  They
secretly scanned everything you ever wrote, far beyond what law
requires. Close your account today, Snowden tweeted.
Any major email service not clearly, categorically denying this
tomorrow  without careful phrasing  is as guilty as Yahoo, Snowden
said in another tweet.

"Hagbard Celineâs gigantic computer, FUCKUP-First Universal
Cybernetic-Kinetic-Ultramicro-Programmer- was basically a rather
sophisticated form of the standard self-programming algorithmic logic
machine of the time; the name was one of his whimsies.
FUCKUPâs real claim to uniqueness was a programmed stochastic process
whereby it could âthrowâ an I Ching hexagram, readingâ a random open
circuit as a broken (yin) line and a random closed circuit as a full
(yang) line until six such âlinesâ were round.
Consulting its memory banks, where the whole tradition of I Ching
interpretation was stored, and then cross-checking its current scannings
of that dayâs political, economic, meteorological, astrological,
astronomical, and technological eccentricities, it would provide a
reading of the hexagram which, to Hagbardâs mind, combined the best of
the scientific and occult methods for spotting oncoming trends.
On March 13, the stochastic pattern spontaneously generated Hexagram 23,
âBreaking Apart.â
FUCKUP then interpreted:
        âThis traditionally unlucky sign was cast by Atlantean
scientist-priests shortly before the destruction of their continent and
is generally connected with death by water. Other vibrations link it to
earthquakes, tornadoes and similar disasters, and to sickness, decay,
and morbidity as well.
        The first correlation is with the unbalance between
technological acceleration and political retrogression, which has
proceeded earth-wide at ever widening danger levels since 1914 and
especially since 1964.
        The breaking apart is fundamentally the schizoid and schismatic
mental fugue of lawyer-politicians attempting to administrate a
worldwide technology whose mechanisms they lack the education to
comprehend and whose gestalt trend they frustrate by breaking apart into
obsolete Renaissance nation-states.
        World War III is probably imminent and, considering the advances
in chemical biological warfare in conjunction with the sickness
vibrations of Hexagram 23, the unleashing of plague or nerve gas or both
is as probable as thermonuclear overkill.
        General prognosis: many megadeaths.
        There is some hope for avoidance of the emerging pattern with
prompt action of correct nature.
        Probability of such avoidance is 0.17 Â± 0.05.
        No blame.â

Sigh... Theo Roszak proposed that money and power are really just
substitutes for, or ways of obtaining, life extension. But that doesn't
mean age is considered wealth and power in Capitalist societies (though
it sure does in the few undamaged tribal societies left)
I ascribe to the idea that accumulation of wealth and political power
(which is for the most part the equivalent of social power over society
and it's individuals) for the sake of those items dynamic in controlling
the continuation of wealth and power (hence social control) in the hands
of oneself and one's friends is a pretty good place to begin, anyway.
That implies for a start, that the wealth and power aren't shared
voluntarily by that group and they conspire to keep it that way (in

assassination death of anwar al-Awalaki's 19 year old son who'd never
been charged with a crime. (more recently that Yemeni taxicab driver who
just happened to pick up the WRONG person)
Does that hint at my answer your question how I feel about the human
scum offered up as US dictators-of-corporate policy and their
corporatist bffs, and their right to privacy?
Get this. Fascist HAVE NO RIGHTS (because they grant you none you can
really exercise freely, usefully) and that fucking well includes their
right to have private, cf. CONSPIRATORIAL, lives.
So Kevin... In light of the above. A question for you.
Is it considered unusual to think politicians need to be held to a
HIGHER STANDARD needing DIFFERENT RULES if they're going to have
relegated and delegated power over our lives?

That's the downside of having power in a corporatist shitstem and it
applies to their whore politicians too. Hillary Clinton is a public

Just like a corporate director has to get up at 3 am while in mid-fuck

a fire' threatening the corporation, someone whose secretary of state or

The example I cite is TexASS, where there were going to be a number of
issues voted on that affected property rights for native Americans
regarding the Border Wall... So the state passed a "RealID" law that cut
every sovereignty-claiming native out of the elections (because soverign
natives don't ascribe to US documentation). By the time the USSC heard
the emergency appeal and rescinded that redaction of Native voting
rights the election was over and the Wall-building interests got what

It's the only logical choice when all you're being offered is Fascists

That IS the level of COWARDICE seen in America today (Shawn Quinn), and
that cowardice HAS created the mess we're in because sheeple willingly

Btw, Bernie Sanders is a National Socialist. Jill Stein invited him to
join her, NOT to coopt what passes for real socialism and destroy the US
Green Party due to attrition of the base, who only vote for
internationalist socialists. He won't. Most likely what would happen is
the Greens would be overwhelmed by progressive-liberals and the party
destroyed, so it all just as well that he sits in one of his three VERY

In 1988 or so I took an Epson HX-20 cp/m laptop and put it on the
intertubz, and packet radio, using a basic 1.1 program I wrote myself
that also would print out (on demand) a log or screen info to it's cash
register tape printer  while storing the info and the program on a
microcassete and it ran at a whopping 1200baud, which was a fast as the
buss and 4K of ram was ever going to go. That was when 9600 baud was
typical and 14.4 was blazing fast.
I made a a packet contact bouncing of the digipeater on the Mir space
station with a friend about 50 miles away using a 2 el quad, that
computer, and a 5 watt Alinco handie-talkie on 2m
Enough brag. My point is, if you wanted to build an orbital telescope
you could, with the kind of collaboration it took to build the 220mhz
California digipeater backbone perhaps, but make some like minded
friends and anything is possible. Even a telescope sat launch from Guyana...

"The founder of Gestalt Therapy, Paul Goodman, speaking by invitation to
the National Security Industrial Association a consortium of arms
manufacturers, at the October 1967 Research and Development in the
1970s symposium, Washington DC.
"You are the military industrial [complex] of the United States, the
most dangerous body of men at present in the world, for you not only
implement our disastrous policies but are an overwhelming lobby for
them, and you expand and rigidify the wrong use of brains, resources,
and labor so that change becomes difficult.
(He continued as the audience sat in stunned silence.)
The best service you people could perform is rather rapidly to phase
yourselves out, passing on your relevant knowledge to people better
qualified, or reorganizing yourselves with entirely different sponsors
and commitments, so that you learn to think and feel in a different way.
Since you are most of the R&D [research and development] that there is,
we cannot do without you as people, but we cannot do with you as you are.
(laughter and booing along with scattered applause)
but we believe, however, that that way of life is unnecessary, ugly,
and un-American.
(Shouts from the audience: Who are we?)
We are I and those people outside we cannot condone your present
operations; they should be wiped off the slate.
I am on the outside thinking your "Science" needs to be Wiped From The
