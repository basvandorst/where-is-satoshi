Here's a link to last year's Report (previous editions may be downloaded, as well):
The WWISR is the result of a survey we perform every year of network operators; survey participants fill in their own answers, & we collect the data, collate it, analyze it, & publish it.  We've observed packet-flooding attacks which are considerably larger than what's reported in the WWISR via ATLAS; but as the WWISR is about what operators see and share, we vet, relay & comment upon the observations of survey respondents.

In the 2009 Arbor WWISR, the largest attack reported was 49gb/sec.  We're currently wrapping up the 2010 WWISR, and the largest attack report was considerably larger.

Some operators offer 'Clean Pipes' commercial DDoS mitigation services; they have various fee models, and they charge their end-customers for it.  It's positioned as a form of insurance, for the end-customer.

Any modern router can handle this.
This can be done with open-source tools or with some commercial tools.
[Full disclosure - I work for a vendor which produces commercial tools in this category.]

Concur, the more serious attackers use diversionary attacks or 'demonstrations' like this from time to time, absolutely.

I see a link-filling attacks with some regularity; but again, what I'm saying is simply that they aren't as prevalent as they used to be, because the attackers don't *need* to fill links in order to achieve their goals, in many cases.
That being said, high-bandwidth DNS reflection/amplification attacks tip the scales, every time.
This is a very important point - determined attackers will observe and react in order to try and defeat successful countermeasures, so the defenders must watch for shifting attack vectors.

I'm not saying that link-flooding attacks don't happen; they certainly do, and on very big links, sometimes.  But in the scheme of things, they don't happen nearly as often as they used to, as the attackers simply don't need to fill the links in order to accomplish their goals, in most cases.
It's also important to note that a lot of DDoS isn't directly perpetrated by those who wish the DDoS performed, but rather is hired out to botmasters who're paid to execute the attacks.  Even if the person who is the motivating force behind the attack is paying in stolen credit cards or whatever, he doesn't want to pay for more than is needed to accomplish his goal.

Application-layer attacks aside, most packet-flooding attacks these days don't completely fill links, as there's no need for the attacker to do so.

Actually, most DDoS attacks aren't link-flooding attacks - this hasn't been true for the last ~7 years or so.
I'm not saying it doesn't happen, because it does, and sometimes quite spectacularly - but in most cases, the attackers don't have to flood the link to achieve their desired goal.

You may wish to do a bit more research on the topic of DDoS in general, as the state of the art in detection/classification/traceback/mitigation is considerably advanced beyond what you've described.

We're seeing a significant uptick in flowspec interest, actually, and S/RTBH has been around for ages.

The technology exists to detect and classify this attack traffic, and is deployed in production networks today.
And of course, the legitimate owners of the botted hosts are generally unaware that their machine is being used for nefarious purposes.
Actually, there're lots of things they can do.
It already exists.

I'm a big advocate of distributed/agile computing models with swarming/flocking behaviors - see slide 32 of this preso for an example:
When these things are harnessed together in order to launch DDoS attacks and steal financial information and intellectual property and so forth, we call them 'botnets'.  They're a force-multiplier which allow the attacker to avoid the von Clausewitzian friction of conflict, and which give him a comfortable degree of anonymity, not to mention highly asymmetrical force projection capabilities and global presence.
'Botnet-like structures' = botnets, for purposes of this discussion.  Semantic hair-splitting.

Well, yes - but short of mass bombardment, eliminating people doesn't scale very well, and is generally frowned upon.

DDoS is just a symptom.  The problem is botnets.  Preventing hosts from becoming bots in the first place and taking down existing botnets is the only way to actually *prevent* DDoS attacks.  Note that prevention is distinct from *defending* oneself against DDoS attacks.

These .pdf presos pretty much express my view of the situation, though I do need to rev the first one:
The bottom line is that there are BCPs that help, but which many folks don't seem to deploy, and then there's little or no thought at all given to maintaining availability when it comes to server/service/app architecture and operations, except by the major players who'd been through the wringer and invest the time and resources to increase their resilience to attack.
Of course, the fundamental flaws in the quarter-century old protocol stack we're running, with all the same problems plus new ones carried over into IPv6, are still there.  Couple that with the brittleness, fragility, and insecurity of the DNS & BGP, and the fact that the miscreants have near-infinite resources at their disposal, and the picture isn't pretty.
And nowadays, the attackers are even more organized and highly motivated (OC, financial/ideological) and therefore more highly incentivized to innovate, the tools are easy enough for most anyone to make use of them, and tthe services/apps they attack are now of real importance to ordinary people. So, while the state of the art in defense has improved, the state of the art and resources available to the attackers have also dramatically improved, and the overall level of indifference to the importance of maintaining availability is unchanged - so the overall situation itself is considerably worse, IMHO.  The only saving grace is that the bad guys often make so much money via identity theft, click-fraud, spam, and corporate/arm's-length governmental espionage that they'd rather keep the networks/services/servers/apps/endpoints up and running so that they can continue to monetize them in other ways.

Nonsense. This is not a technical issue, it's a socio-political issue. Itâs both naive & distracting to try & solve this set of problems with code and/or silicon, when it must in fact be addressed within the civic arena. There are no purely technical solutions to social ills.  Schneier of all people should know this. Roland Dobbins
