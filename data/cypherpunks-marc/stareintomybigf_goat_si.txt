@_subject: Outreachy - Internerships for Underrrepresented People in Tech 
Please do not send your hateful, sexist, and racist (((news))) to this list.
$11.45hr is shit.  Interns need at least $20hr.  Apple, Intel, and
Microsoft all pay $40+hr. How is this a good thing ?
And "whites" are less than 10% of the global population, yet they are
not a "minority" to you shitbags.
If you want to increase the representation of women and the likes in
certain industries, I hear they are underrepresented in coal mining,
garbage collecting, and workplace deaths, to name a few.
Why is this not a gap you seek to fill ?
Yet you do exactly that with shit like this.
You have been reported for hate crime.
