One day little Johnny went to his father, and asked him if he could buy him
a $200 bicycle for his birthday.Johnny's father said, "Johnny, we have a
$80,000 mortgage on the house, and you want me to buy you a bicycle? Wait
until Christmas."Christmas came around, and Johnny asked again. The father
said, "Well, the mortgage is still extremely high, sorry about that. Ask me
again some other time."Well, about two days later, the boy was seen walking
out of the house with all his belongings in a suitcase. The father felt
sorry for him, and asked him why he was leaving.The boy said, "Yesterday I
was walking past your room, and I heard you say that you were pulling out,
and mommy said that you should wait because she was coming too."And I'll be
DAMNED if I get stuck with an $80,000 mortgage!"
One day a Frenchman went to visit his English friend. When he came up to
his friend's house, a big dog ran out and began to bark at him. The
Frenchman was frightened and stopped. At that moment the Englishman came out
and saw his friend. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "Don't you know the proverb
'Barking dogs don't bite'?" "Oh,yes" was the quick answer. "I know the
proverb, and you know the proverb, but, does the dog know the proverb?"
