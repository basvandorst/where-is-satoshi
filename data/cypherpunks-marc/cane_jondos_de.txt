No - you can not compile the TC source without modification. The source
code you can download from the website doesn't compile.
An analysis of Truecrypt was done by the Privacy-CD team:

Panopticlick is a demonstration project, how browser fingerprinting
works and not a scientific up2date database for actual used browsers.
- The database is not a representative database, because most users, who
know something about the project and visit it, use a privacy-friendly
browser configuration.
- Old entries in the database were not deleted. Firefox 3.5.3 has one of
the best ratings in this database. But nobody uses this old browser
version any more. You will be unique with this user agent in real life.
- It is easy to manipulate the database. You can call the page with your
preferred browser multiple times and your preferred browser will be
higher rated.
Best regards

You may have a look of "I2P Bote" it is severless, encrypted mail
system, address is the public key, P2P based... nice tool.
  It is part of the Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a P2P darknet.
The I2P router is router and client in one Java application. You have to
install he I2P router first: Afterwards you can add the "I2P Bote plugin", the serverless mail
system. SMTP- and POP3 support was on the ToDo list some times ago, I
didn't have a look on the latest version of the project.
Installation is not very easy, but possible.
Best regards
