@_subject: Taking the 5th on the IRS 
We have slightly modified key 2003 IRS tax forms to allow filers to selectively assert their right against self-incrimination on a item-by-item basis.  It also offers more timid tax objectors a way to provide crowd cover for the more adventurous in a near invisible way.
An explanation of our purposes, methods and risks, as well as links for the form downloads is available in an Acrobat (.pdf) file at Tools for individual liberty
