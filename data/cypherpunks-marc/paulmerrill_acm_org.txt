The car pools are to relieve the congested traffic
conditions on Manhattan, at least officially.

Oops, forgot to point out that "federal employees"
in general are still treated as sub-citizens,
Frequent Flier benefits are still limited to
military, Foreign Service, and their families.

In this particular case, the legislation merely
removes previously imposed limits which lowered
some citizens below the rest.

Well, you could try comparing the reality involved
with multiple cards and see where the patterns
fit.  I know that that is how I find the meanings
of strange databases for which I don't have access
to the data dictionary.  And it really is the same

One must always be careful to blame the right
entities.  The schools made a rule and the judge
made it law. CONGRESS wasn't involved - this time.

As several have pointed out, a single system these
days is replaceable readily. OTOH if anyone were
to decide that I were Disloyal they would get 4 or
5 depending on the day in question. Additionally,
in my freelance days they would have gotten data
from a client or two.
If we assume that only encrypted data is the
"problem" (grounds for extended seizure), then
only Bad Data should be encrypted and it should be
stored separately from other data stores. A
Usually Off Snap server on the network and
secreted in a wall, or some such, would work,
especially with wireless.  Off site, over-the-wire
would also work, but, in either case, there would
need to be no Residual Indicators when not in use.
Let us remember that the Committee for State
Security so recently and its little brethren are
not reluctant to use extra-legal means when they
have determined your guilt and need to build a
winnable case.  Which leads me to the real point
of my initial post: When the case looks unWinnable
(or insufficiently winnable) there is no
reluctance to go to early penalty phase - arrest
at 5:01 Friday for a holiday weekend, gather up
all the hardware and leave you with no means of
support, along with other methods as applicable to
the situation.
