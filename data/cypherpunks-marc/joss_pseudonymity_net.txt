Just to correct this: the sentence was 16 weeks, not 16 months.
The legislation in question is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act of 2000 (RIPA), part III of which has been in force in the UK since
2007. This allows for a maximum sentence of two years for refusing a
request that encrypted data be "put into an intelligible form".
