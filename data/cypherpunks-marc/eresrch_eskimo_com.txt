Brands' paper that Adam refers to says that you can't double spend to
begin with.  That's in the first intro paragraph, I haven't read much
else yet.  But let's take the smart card idea one step towards "real" money.  What
makes the money real?  The fact that a government produced it ( or
better, people believe whoever produced it will keep their promise). So if
the card is produced by a trusted party, and you can't actually double
spend (especially if you don't have access to the hardware), then
anonymous cash transfer off line can work.  But the trick here is the
trusted computing device - it *is* money.  People can certainly
counterfeit it, and the technology for detecting that will be fun,
but the basic principle is similar to real cash.  Each device can
have a serial number (just like real bills do) but there's no reason to
tie a device to any particular person, and people can trade devices or
transfer amounts between them as they please.

In this case "double spending" and "counterfeit" are the same thing -
you can spend the same coin 1000 times in a few seconds.  As anonymous
points out, it can be from half way across the planet too.  Banks aren't
going to deal nicely with double spent coins, they can't afford to.
But it's not until the coin goes back online, you need the minter's secret
key to decode the chain (maybe I have that wrong?).
I was thinking about this a bit while drifting off to sleep last night.
It'd be cool to have electronic paper bills - flexable/cloth electronics
where the value of the bill is variable.  At each transaction, the bill
reduces the amount it has (plain old smart card stuff) but it'd have
the look and feel of paper money.  the transaction machines that work
with the bills would all need to be online, but you could easily trade
bills for anonymous barter.  It might even be easy to have a reader that
just tells how much is left in the bill.  The point here isn't technology,
it's psycology.  The bill "looks" like money, so people will trust that
it is :-)

While I agree with goal, it's not clear to me that it's physically
possible.  What makes "money" useful is it's physical existance, people
have been counterfiting coins since they were invented but it's been
getting harder to do.  With off-line coins you could easily counterfit or
double spend and live off the float, especially if you do it all
anonymously.  And if you just do it once with some huge sum, you'd get
away with it (like Enron guys did :-)
Money boils down to psycology - people trust that it trades their effort
for somebody elses effort.  who's going to trust ephemeral bits?  Crossing

That's true for all RFID stuff, but the next generation the military is

which can tell you something about the environment (like presense or

they'll still have to power the things externally so the same shielding

I still think the basic problem is simple - how do you trust the bits?  If
the actual computations are done inside a secure box, most people will
trust it.  There will always be people who try to beat the system, but
it'll take a lot of technology, and they'll do it often enough to get

The idea of "coins" isn't fluid enough, people want something more like

Right, sometimes academics pays off :-)
The assumption in all this is that you get 1 bit of output per

measurement.  Then the actual sample rate you need is (output rate)/n
You can get 8 bit A/D's that run at 1 GHz, so even if you smash 4
raw samples to get 8 bits, that's 2 Gb/s of random noise.
Time muxing a whole bunch of slower devices is also an obvious way
to increase the total data rate, and has been done since the 1950's
in real implementations.   Putting 100 10MHz devices into one hub
wouldn't be all that hard to do either.
So as an academic excercise, building Gb/s random bit generators is
definitly possible with today's technology.

hopeless to try because fools are so clever!
I don't have a problem with a signing system that requires the user to
do something (like maybe even use a pda stylus and actually sign with
their own handwriting), but *forcing* them to read a contract is just
plain silly.  When enough fools have been burned by a scam, the word
will get out and the rest of the fools who don't read contracts might
think about not signing.

Right so far.
the tap sequence is just the bits from the polynomial:
x^32 + x^7 is the xor of 2 bits.  + x^5 is the xor of
a 3rd bit, and so on.  So you just do what the polynomial
says, add up the bits!
Then you shift them one place (multiply or divide by x basicly).
The new bit you computed is rotated in, and the ms or ls bit
is lost (depending on which way you shift).
Where did you find that?  It's irreducible if it
is a member of x^(2^n) + 1.  I didn't know there was that
simple a test for primitive.
Your tap sequence.
Yup, you do.
It comes from cyclotomic polynomials and finding out that all the
irreducible polynomials combine to form a really simple expression.
Quite amazing really - that's one of those "beautiful" things in math.

Somebody asked me last week how to take square roots over GF(p^m) and my

GF(2^m), but mod p".  For GF(2^m) polynomials you can compute a "T"
T_i = x^2i mod (prime polynomial)
You then find the inverse of this matrix.  To compute the square root of
any arbitrary polynomial, you just multiply T^-1 to the arbitrary
polynomial (modulo the prime polynomial of course).
That seems straight forward.  Any books out there that people can point me

This is kinda the opposite of...

anything about how it works does not have to destroy the effectiveness of
digital signatures or crypto.  When people sign a document they don't know
all the ramifications because few bother to read all of any document they
sign - most of it won't apply as long as you keep your part of the bargin,
so why bother?
The same thing should be true of digital signatures.  The user shouldn't
have to know a thing, other than they've made a promise they better keep
or all the bad clauses really do apply, and the proof of their signature
will come to haunt them.  The way the digital signature works does not
matter to them, and it shouldn't need to.
If digital crypto, signatures or e-cash are going to get into mass appeal,
then their operations will be "magic" to the majority.  And it all has to
work, to 1 part in 10^8th or better, without user comprehension.

With ECC you just recompute the public key from the private

RSA you just pick some random value (not zero or 1) and
see if r^(e*d) = 1 mod N, or if you know p and q (where
N = p*q) check that e*d = 1 mod (p-1)*(q-1).  It's the
same thing as encrypting/decrypting something to see if
you get the same thing back.  If not, something is wrong.
I'm not sure how you can tell which key might be corrupted.
For the public side, having the key reside in many places
would do it - you can just check that they are all the same.
so it may well be that saving the public key in a private
place for that purpose is also useful.

All future songs of *some* companies.  As long as it's an option, there
will be people out there selling CD's to get their music out.  You're not
missing anything.  The question is: will it always be an option?
I hope so.  A bunch of huge companies that need encrypted set top boxes
tied directly to an HDTV and hard to physically hack means lots of jobs.
And they will compete with the markets already in place.  So that's more
jobs for more engineers.

they can give me MS Office or they can send me ascii.  The market will

DRM isn't the problem.  Legislating DRM is the problem.  You can go buy
IBM portables with secure key chips built in right now to help protect
your box and your business data.  That's TCPA.  Nothing wrong with it,
it's a good idea.
It doesn't become wrong until it becomes forced down our throats.  That's
where S.2048 becomes something to worry about, it forces us to use
hardware we don't need (or may not need for our purposes).  TCPA and DRM
are not the problem here, and privacy and copyright are side issues too.
There is no need for the law to intervene, the market will decide how all
this stuff can be used efficiently and effectively.

Exactly.  Let the market decide.  This is why it's necessary to
contact your congress critter - they don't need to be involved.
As long as it's not legislated, nobody needs to worry about what
gets fabbed.  The market will decide if DRM makes any economic sense.
I'm betting it doesn't, but I've been wrong before.  Untrusted
platforms will be cheaper than trusted ones, so there has to be some
incentive for customers to buy them.  Economic incentives make far
more sense than legislated ones.
The main point is not the content of the bill, or its purpose.  The
main point is that government is being told to get involved in the market
place, and that, all by itself, is a *bad* idea.  If people want to
build trusted platforms and put them on the market they can go ahead
and do it.  If people don't want to buy them, that's their choice,
and if others do decide it's worth it, they should be allowed to.
As long as TCPA is really an option, the market place is a good way
to sort things out.  But S.2048 needs to die, not for scary reasons,

Exactly my point - economicly it can't work for the "nightmare" scenario.
The whole DRM concept is seriously flawed, and the fact it's being
pushed by a guy who used to run a paint-ball arena is really no
There's a large group of academics working on DRM concepts for access
to university facilities, including libraries and computers.  They
use secure platforms, but they still have to worry about who gets
physical access to the platform.
And I also don't think "conspiricy" is the right term.  The article
Lucky quoted from indicated that use of the trusted platform for
DRM was an afterthought, and that's much more believeable.  A bunch
of sharks looking for money all swim around the same target.  It has
to do with where the money is, not any collusion between the players.
S.2048 is not likely to see the light of day.  The automotive
industry is bigger than the entertainment industry, and they have
more sway in washington when it comes to how much some bill is
going to cost them.  S.2048 makes cars way too expensive, and when
union workers find out that a) they will have fewer jobs and b)
they won't be able to watch videos when they get home, the shit
will hit the fan big time.

Depends on how they got the source.  They may know it's one of 5
possible choices because of the person who sent (or received) it.
If it's just found on a disk in a garbage dump with no connections
to anyone, it's a bit tougher.  But every algorithm has some statistical
signature and if you've got enough cipher text you can compare that
signature with known algorithms to home in on fewer choices.
I'm not sure having the plaintext helps much more, but you could
use random keys to create several ciphertexts with known algorithms and

That does seem to be the purpose - but may not be what was planned - it

really, so conjecture is all we've got to go on.  So far we know that
the guys writing Palldium are not happy with TCPA - it doesn't solve
their problems the way they like.  We know less about the TPM.  What's
"right" or "wrong" about vaporware is kind of hard to pin down.  There
are some basic conceptual things we do know, and we know there are already
commercial solutions to problems that TCPA claims to attempt to solve.
I'm working from what I know about those existing devices and project that
onto TCPA.  I may well be wrong, and hopefully somebody who's actually
building TCPA and TPM can give us concrete answers.
I have to disagree.  If I control the content of the TPM, *I* can trust
it,  and anybody who trusts *me* can trust it too.  What other remote
observers of my system are there than the ones *I* trust?  Or to put
in another way - I only want remote observers that I trust to have the
ability to check my TPM.
This is what it all boils down to - "who is in charge of what?"  If I
create a fixed key, I can authenticate myself via multiple channels and
build trust to multiple and independent parties.  That is how TPM becomes
If somebody else controls the TPM, they may well *not* trust me, and they
may put my computer to work doing something I don't like.  In that case,
I can not trust my computer, because my computer does not trust me.  (I
said may, just because it's possible doesn't mean it will happen.)
What started this very long and interesting discussion was the fear
that TCPA is going to be mandated by law.  That is a very bad idea,
and as long as the fear is real, we need some very good arguments to
prevent it from happening.  The main one is economic, the secondary
one is that we don't need it - you can buy hardware that does the same
thing off the shelf and plug it in to any generic PC.
If the authors of Palladium want their software to work, they should
look at the commercial hardware security computing platforms already

is off the hook for being part of "the evil empire", and the empire wins
And as long as the user has control of the TOR, that's not a problem.

Basicly, MS's point of view is that Palladium is their baby, and they
need solutions to their problems.  TCPA is independent, if they can be

Or who ever steals the master key.
The difference is fundamental: I can change every bit of flash in my BIOS.
I can not change *anything* in the TPM.  *I* control my BIOS.  IF, and
only IF, I can control the TPM will I trust it to extend my trust to
others.  The purpose of TCPA as spec'ed is to remove my control and
make the platform "trusted" to one entity.  That entity has the master
key to the TPM.
Now, if the spec says I can install my own key into the TPM, then yes,
it is a very useful tool.  It would be fantastic in all the portables
that have been stolen from the FBI for example.  Assuming they use a
password at turn on, and the TPM is used to send data over the net,
then they'd know where all their units are and know they weren't
compromised (or how badly compromised anyway).
But as spec'ed, it is very seriously flawed.
The untouchable code zone.  That's fine for an embedded application,
but for a general purpose computing platform it's great for dictators.
Yes, dictatorships are stable governments for the short run.  Most people
are willing to put up with slavery as long as they get food and sleep.
But there are enough people who read history (and who have escaped
dictatorships) to prevent really bad things from being forced down
everyone's throats.  TCPM seems like clipper and it also seems like
it'd be pretty easy to sell as evil (whether it is or not).  I don't

I agree that the market can have the chance!!  Just don't make it
anything to do with the law!  If people want to buy platforms with TCPA
built in they should be allowed to, and those who don't should be
free to choose that way.  You now claim there are at least 2 keys
that don't leave the chip, but if you are going to recover anything
encrypted by those keys you had better have them off chip when the
chip dies.
D'oh!!  Obviously it's a bad feature - it gives my computer to some
unknown entity.  In fact, it gives the entire network of computers
to one entity - it creates a huge monster of unequal power.  I can
sure see why a government like Iraq would love to have this feature.
Or China.  Or the US.  You could run a special program that nobody
can stop or find or know about.  That's *POWER*.  It is difficult
to understate how bad that is.
Look, if there can be a section of code that only the manufacturer
has access to, then that section of code could have an internet download
section that sucks "evil intent" from someplace the manufacturer (or
someone who's broken into them) has designated.  It's not that we're
saying it'd be done on purpose up front, but somebody some day will
figure it out and all the tools are there to make it happen.  Sometimes
a good imagination can save you from having to be paranoid.
Then we agree completely!  So long as no laws are passed around TCPA,
and it is not linked to any copyright laws, or mandated in any way,
then there's no problem!  IF TCPA gives people something they want,
and they understand how it works, I don't see anything wrong with it.
I do see a problem in it being written into any laws because the
potential for abuse is huge.
It will also make backups really expensive.
The only way it works is if there can be code the user doesn't control
the loading of.  That means somebody else controls the machine.  It's
pretty basic.
Horsepucky.  I can run trusted software right now.  *I* wrote it, that's
why I trust it!  I don't need a dongle on the motherboard to ship trusted
software.  An external dongle works just fine.  And I can check the
signature of source code I compile to be sure the author has sent me
the correct code - I trust it will do what it's supposed to because
the encrypted hash matches the source hash.
going back to the key stuff - you've changed the names, but what it
boils down to is that *somebody* has to have a copy of the internal
keys used to encrypt data by the TPM.  If it's not the user, who is
it?  That's the person who owns the data, because they own the keys.

If there's no way to debug the "hidden" (so called "trusted") code using
standard techniques, then how can you know it works right?  Most all
processors now have hardware debugging capability - it is a requirement
due to the complexity of the chips.  *Somebody* has to be able to run
a hardware debugger and have access to the raw hardware, even if it's just
Intel running with the covers off.
If I'm going to write a TOR, I want access to internal registers.  So
I'd expect there's a hardware interface to do that.  This basicly breaks
the whole thing.
You can't have a generic platform *and* a trusted platform.  You can have
a trusted platform which is *specific* - nobody but the manufacturer knows
the guts.  If people want to buy it because it does something useful,
that's ok, but don't call it a generic PC.
As an aside, check out   it's a hardware debugger
for a DSP (which I built).  The Intel processor may not work the same way,
but it's got to have some kind of similar interface, and anybody like me
can build an interface into it.
If the processor is sealed into a tamper proof case (like the IBM 4875)
Then it can be made secure for one manufacturer.  The system is checked
before being sealed.  If people want to add one to their PC they are free
to do so, but they understand who owns the key inside the sealed case.
With TCPA people do not know who owns the key - and that's its basic
Until we know real hardware details, we're not really going to figure out
what's going on.  Since Palladium guys claim that TCPA doesn't do what
they want, it seems that the hardware hasn't been figured out yet.  If the
processor isn't sealed to prevent people like me from building hardware
debuggers, then Palladium will be cracked by someone.  If it is sealed

But it's easier to manufacture it by burning fuse links so it

How does the CA check the endorsement certificate?  If it's by

OK, I'm going to discuss it from a philosophical perspective.
i.e. I'm just having fun with this.
I don't like the idea that users *must* have a "certificate".  Why
can't each person develop their own personal levels of trust and
associate it with their own public key?  Using multiple channels,
people can prove their key is their word.  If any company wants to
associate a certificate with a customer, that can have lots of meanings
to lots of other people.  I don't see the usefullness of a "permanent
certificate".  Human interaction over electronic media has to deal
with monkeys, because that's what humans are :-)
Ouch, that doesn't sound too robust.
The CA has a bit too much power if you ask me.  Those are some really
good reasons not to like the idea of a "permanent certificate" ruled
by one (nasty?) person.
I really, REALLY, *REALLY*, don't like the idea of one entity having
the ability to create or destroy any persons ability to use their
computer at whim.  You are suggesting that one person (or small group)
has the power to create (or not) and revoke (or not!) any and all TPM's!
I don't know how to describe my astoundment at the lack of comprehension
of history.
There's no problem if we just extend our normal concepts of trust between
humans on a face to face level onto the net.  Person to person, peer to
peer, face to face.  It's all the same thing, and using the technology
to make it happen the same way it happens in the street is going to be
the ultimate success story.  Nobody controls everything, but some people
have some control of some resources.  People who attempt to rule the
whole world usually burn out sooner or later :-)
How about everybody on their block signs each other's keys, and when
one monkey misbehaves, the other ones toss 'em out of the troop.
A Web of trust is kind of like a group signature.
If a company wants control of their hardware, they should put their own
private keys in each machine.  They can use that with each persons
public key and create a reasonably secure system for their business.  They
don't need a privacy CA, and they can prove to any other firm that the
person with the box on their premisis *must* be from the right place.
If TCPA is going to fly as a real business it can't just be for DRM.
If copyright owners want people to buy their stuff, they'll have to sell
"copyright owners certificate" which can be based on the customer's key.
Again, nobody needs a privacy CA.
There is no valid argument for centralized control *of anything*.
TCPA is a valid concept in and of itself.  It's way too dangerous
a weapon if forced down people's throats the wrong way.  So the TCPA guys
should sell their boxes as useful tools to lots of big corporations,
and forget about the "content industry".  There's a lot more money to

iDEFENSE has to find the subscriber after the fact, not before (I think).
If I were HP I'd have done the same thing they did - why be pushed
around when you can fight back?  I think the crackers screwed up,
they should have given a presentation to HP with a proof that there's
a crack, and then request (politely) some compensation for where
it was.  by making it a reasonable request, HP saves engineering time
and their software, and the crackers get into business.  If they'd
gone in with a "win-win" attitude, the crackers would have made money,
HP would have saved a lot of money, and everyone would be a lot happier.
"moral obligation" and "mental attitude" are not the same thing, but
I think the right attitude would make the morals a lot simpler.
So rather than paying paltry sums to crackers, iDEFENSE might do better
as a agency for crackers.  If they do the business to business end
for the crackers, and negotiate contracts, then they get a cut, and
the crackers get a lot more motivation to go find problems.  I think

In the '80's it was "obvious" that oil production would peak around 1995.
We've already burned up all the solar energy collected from 140 to 250
million years ago - the dinosaur model does not fit the amount of oil
we're actually finding.  There's a lot more oil in the ground (most of
it may be under the oceans) so the price isn't going to rise that much for
the next 100 years.
That doesn't make "biomass" a bad fuel, but if it's gonna compete it
will have to get down to $20/barrel to be a clear winner.
Ethanol pollutes, any hydrocarbon is going to be mixed with N2 and make
NOx, there's no getting around it with any kind of Otto engine.  Oil
doesn't *need* to make wars either.  It's just that people with guns
also happen to be oil sellers, and stealing oil is cheaper than buying
it.  We could just buy Iraqi oil and solve a lot of problems all around.
Like I've said before, the key to corruption is to make it work in
your favor.  The Romans, Spanish, French and American empires are all
the same, corruption eventually causes them to collapse.  But people
still live there, with entrenched corruption.
I think our best solution is to escape.  Mars might be far enough away
that we can start a nice civilazation.  But it'll turn corrupt eventually
because that's how humans work.  So we'll need to leave the keys for
future escapes :-)

@_subject: Crytpo algorithm? 
Hey guys, (are there *any* women reading this list?) I actually have a
crypto question.
In the TI docs for their Digital Signature Transponder they reference
document number 24-09-05-012 "Digital Signature Transponder Algorithm and
Software Requirements".  This seems to be a trade secret since they say an
NDA is required to get it.
It really isn't anything close to a "digital signature", it's more like a
hashing algorithm.  The key is 40 bits and the result is 24 bits.  The
basic operation is to send a 40 bit challenge and then check the 24 bit
result for a go/nogo final output.
The whole thing runs at 134 kHz, so it shouldn't take much to hack
something up to watch bits fly around.  While this challenge is enticing
because it's so easy with not much effort, it's still easier to ask for
details which might actually be available.
Has anyone seen the actual crypto algorithm used in the TI DST devices?
And how close is it to the Ford Securilock E-PATS system?
Just curious :-)

This really gets into my interpretation.  I don't need hidden
variables.  The crux to me is that the particles are correlated
and we use math to describe the probability of what the correlation is.
Once we measure one particle we know the other one.  Before we measure
we don't know anything.  That's all.  QM tells us what the probability
distribution is for any given measurement, it can't tell us anything
about a particular outcome.
In my model there is no instantaneous choice.  It was chosen at
the start.  We can not know anything about the correlation until
we measure, then we know everything.

Automotive environments are known to be harsh, so electronics is protected
to some extent.  The assumption is that spark plug voltages can get into
sensors, so most data lines are protected as are the sensor lines.  If you
try to fry things with double the voltage of a standard spark plug it may
not work, if you use 10 times that it will, but the ESD protection will
obviously be blown too.  That begins to look suspicious (but I doubt
anyone could _prove_ you fried it on purpose).
The main question is how deep is the memory of these things.  If they only
remember the last catastrophic event then "privacy" isn't a problem.  The
actual routes taken are not stored.  If you are in an accident and the
cops ask you to take a breath test, you can take the test or not - and
deal with the consequences of the legal system based on your choice.  The
data taken from the recorder for the "event" is then corroboration, which
may help instead of hurt you.
If the box remembers everything you do, and the garage mechanic can use it

Nor does it mean the op amp driving the speakers will follow them either.
High speed and power are a hard combination to build.
It's definitly why you need fast digital.  To reproduce 20+ kHz you should
use a 200kHz sample rate and have a nice filter stage before the power
amp.  "good digital" can do more things than good analog because the final
output is good analog in both cases.  The speaker driver is pure analog
by definition.
To produce 65kHz (for cats) my present boss prefers a 1 MHz sample rate.
The guys who do bats think it's good enough for 200kHz, but my boss won't
do bats - much too complex.  We've got a 25 bit dac which updates at
1 MHz, but we still need a nice filter and analog output stage for 120 dB
clean signals.  (I'm only getting 100 dB because it costs too much to
really do the best possible.)  Clearly a digital system can be built
that can create any wave form a speaker can follow, and it's easier to
control than an analog system.
The human hearing system is capable of noticing phase relations at 100kHz
rates.  So any sample rate faster than 200kHz is outside the range of
human detection.  Cats can notice phase shifts in the 200kHz range, and
bats are out in the 400kHz range.  Biological systems *are* impressive.
But digital vs analog is a silly argument, the final stage is analog.

I agree.  Even India has a few with wealth far beyond the imagination of
most Americans, and many with the same living standard as Americans.  They
certainly see it.  Sarad, care to give us a short political description of
how India views its poorest population and how they want to eliminate
their suffering?  What fraction of India's population is "dirt poor"?

Yup, it is mighty hard to explain with words.  You have to see with your
own eyes how 3 billion people live to comprehend "dirt poor".
Unfortunatly, the wealthy prefer not to see.

It has more to do with the desire to own *more* stuff.  Bigger houses with
3 cars and full of wireless computers.  It has nothing to do with
government propaganda and everything to do with corporate propaganda.
It's a self full filling economic system, the more people want, the more
people work to create things that more people want!
The insaniity is self inflicted.  The French take off the whole month of
August and Americans think they are insane.  The French know how to relax!
They also live in smaller houses, only own 1 car per family and eat better
food.  If you want to live in a 5000 ft^2 house, you need 2 adults working
full time to make "ends meet".  If you live in a 1000 ft^2 house, one
adult can make the payments with one full time job.
If you are going to compare then and now, take reality into account.

Looks pretty cool.  If you have a bluetooth transmitter you can tell it's
there.  So you don't even need to go look for it, it'll just talk to you
directly.  I can see how the trucking industry would love it :-)

I think there's a lot in the game to that.  He *will* resign,
he won't be fired :-)
That has nothing to do with it.  The pentagon had a choice, fire
Poindexter or lose all of DARPA.  DARPA  has a lot of cool programs that
are too important to lose, and Poindexter was giving them bad publicity.
From congres's perspective, choping off $2.5 billion to get rid of
Poindexter was no big deal.  For the pentagon it is a big deal.  So they
rid themselves of Poindexter and save everything else.  Even Rumsfeld can
understand that :-)
