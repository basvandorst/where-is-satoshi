As they corresponded, the hacker infected [accused pedo, OC CA Judge]
Kline's computer with a virus that allowed him to copy
the entire contents of the judge's hard drive. The hacker, whom prosecutors have not named, then
messaged Posey about what he had found.

images of young boys engaging in sex and lewd behavior. Further investigation led to child
molestation charges after a man told Irvine police that Kline sexually abused him a quarter-century
ago when the accuser was 12.
