Related Spiegel article (hat tip to cryptoparty.is mailing list):  The money quote:
"Things become "catastrophic" for the NSA at level five - when, for  example, a subject uses a combination of Tor, another anonymization  service, the instant messaging system CSpace and a system for Internet  telephony (voice over IP) called ZRTP. This type of combination results in  a "near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence,"  the NSA document states.

This may be old news to some but I found it quite remarkable to discover  today that prior to fleeing what I like to call "The United State", Ed  Snowden apparently ran a major Tor exit node named "TheSignal".  Furthermore, he helped to organize and throw a freakin' Crypto Party on  Oahu (contacting and co-ordinating via email with Runa Sandvik using his  legal name!!) about six months prior to bailing for Hong Kong.
According to the same Pandodaily article he "was trying to get some of his  buddies at âworkâ to set up additional Tor nodesâ¦".

To be fair the TLS setup on the secex.info mentioned in the video has  since been fixed, however I am not sure if the other flaws have been  addressed along with a public announcement that they were fixed. I'm  skeptical that's the case.
Wickr has been offering a $100,000 bug bounty for a year now. It might be  an opportunity for someone with the right skill set to clean up.  Some additional thoughts:
1) Wickr claims on the front page of their web site that they are 'the  first company to put a warrant canary in our transparency report'. This  may be true with the crucial detail of it being including in a  transparency report.
At first I was pretty sure Nico Sell was claiming in a video or interview  that Wickr is the first company to use a warrant canary, which would be  patently untrue, but I could have misheard.
Rsync.net has been doing this since at least 2007. They are the first  company I am aware of to have done so.
2) I like the fact that Wickr has a desktop client. I have long wished  that something similar existed for TextSecure and Redphone.
3) Wickr has raised 30 million in venture capital in a round led by Jim  Breyer, founder and CEO of Breyer Capital who made his first billion with  an early investment in Facebook.
4) The 'Technical Mumbo Jumbo' youtube reviewer guy has another video  where he demonstrates how easy it is to grab a screenshot on an iOS device  of a 'self destructing' message. Screenshot has been disabled on Android,  but considering iOS was the first device Wickr was released on, this is an  embarrassing flaw in their client and marketing claims. I recommend  watching all his video reviews of Wickr.

Some of the quotes from The Brookings Institution's 2009 policy paper  titled, "Which Path to Persia? Options for a New American Strategy Toward  Iran," are eye popping.
"..any military operation against Iran will likely be very unpopular  around the world and require the proper international contextâ both to  ensure the logistical support the operation would require and to minimize  the blowback from it. The best way to minimize international opprobrium  and maximize support (however, grudging or covert) is to strike only when  there is a widespread conviction that the Iranians were given but then  rejected a superb offerâone so good that only a regime determined to  acquire nuclear weapons and acquire them for the wrong reasons would turn  it down. Under those circumstances, the United States (or Israel) could  portray its operations as taken in sorrow, not anger, and at least some in  the international community would conclude that the Iranians âbrought it  on themselvesâ by refusing a very good deal."
They've laid out the entire maniac war plans in plain sight for anyone  curious enough to read.
Problem is 'muhricans don't read, and the elite know this.

This is a case study of why I welcome crackdowns on online freedom and  corporate silo censorship; it's highly effective in getting people off  their ass and drives them into the warm and loving arms of free software  and crypto.

The cancellation or temporary suspension of various Spanish Twitter  accounts has led to a huge migration of Spaniards to GNU social, a  microblogging service designed to foster user freedom and control. This is  an exciting win for federated online services.
Unlike Twitter, which is controlled by a centralized authority, GNU social  is a network of independent servers called nodes. Federation technology  allows users to communicate between nodes, preserving the unified  experience of traditional social media systems, and the free GNU social  software allows anybody with an Internet connection to start their own  public or private node and join the network. These administrators can even  customize their nodes to suit the unique needs of their users.
Since GNU social is decentralized, it's harder for a company or government  to censor content or shut down the network when they feel threatened by  it. This is more than a hypothetical threatâit has been attempted multiple  times by oppressive governments. Spreading out user data also makes bulk  surveillance considerably more difficult, as there is no single database  to crack into and copy.

Has been a crazy day (15.01.15) on quitter.no and .is  - -regards The node Quitter.es (Quitter Spain) was created to handle some of the  extra people that overloaded existing GNU social instances like Quitter.no  and Quitter.is. Quitter Spain now has 6,667 users and counting and  Quitter.se reports 4,982 users, due in part to the incoming Spanish users.
GNU social is not the only federated social network challenging the  centralized status quo.

It's about damn time ;)
INTERNET â Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill announced they were leaving  The Intercept, Saturday, citing conflicts of interest with Pierre Omidyar,  founder and owner.
In an exclusive interview with the Internet Chronicle, Scahill said,  âFirstly, Iâm sorry to the folks at Pando. I ran my mouth off on twitter,  but then I did my research and it was obvious that The Interceptâs  founder, Pierre, was off fomenting world wars in Ukraine on behalf of the  US government. I canât report on anything and take money like that.â
Scahill heaved a sigh of relief and his eyes watered, âWhen I came to  Glenn and told him why I had to step down, he laughed and told me, âYour  bravery is inspiring,â and then he said how guilty he was at backing Tor,  a pseudo-activist internet cloaking device built and maintained by the US  Greenwald apologized to Yasha Levine of Pando, who reported on Torâs  funding, saying, âI know I called you a conspiracy theorist, but I was  just shooting from the hip. Iâm sorry for that. I had backed Tor for too  long. I now know that youâre basically right. Tor is a military-backed  project working towards the militaryâs ends and I was a useful idiot that  drew in countless thousands by promoting it. And Pierre Omidyar, he was  always pushing me to put Tor into my stories even when it didnât fit. The  guilt will haunt me to my death, but at least if I speak out now I can  minimize the damage to others, even though it damages me personally. It  isnât easy to admit youâve been accidentally doing propaganda work for the  US military, but it sure is a relief to get away from The Intercept.â
Greenwaldâs eyes twinkled as he said, âSnowdenâs dream can finally come  true. Weâre going to do it, finally. Weâre going to publish the list of  people who are in prison because of the NSAâs illegal parallel  investigations, and theyâre going to go free, god dammit!â
Both Greenwald and Scahill remain upbeat and have already joined the staff  at Internet Chronicle, where they will take a massive pay cut and forego  all bylines for a year in an act of voluntary penitence as they work on  freeing the victims of illegal NSA wiretapping.

I posted about this exact issue back in December, mostly to the sound of  To recap the timeline:
Sometime late 2012 - Snowden emails Runa Sandvik and provides his real  name and address in order to obtain some Tor stickers. *** Link between  his legal identity and the cincinnatus email appears to have  been established at this point to anyone monitoring his communications ***  Discussion leads to the idea to host a Cryptoparty. [1]
December 1, 2012: Snowden emails Greenwald for the first time via  cincinnatus address [1]
December 11, 2012: Snowden hosts the Cryptoparty in Hawaii while waiting  for Greenwald to reply. Party is organized USING THE SAME  cincinnatus address as a point of contact on the public  cryptoparty web site. [2]
Jan. 2013: Snowden reaches out to Laura Poitras, a documentary filmmaker.  February 2013: Edward Snowden contacts Greenwald himself. (which Greenwald  later retracts, as some claim he realized he himself could also face  criminal charges for having advance knowledge of Snowden's plans to join  Booz Allen Hamilton with the express intent of obtaining more documents to  leak) [4]
March 2013: Snowden seeks a new contractor job with Booz Allen Hamilton at  the same NSA facility in Hawaii. He later tells the South China Morning  Post that he did so to get additional access to classified documents he  intends to leak. [3]
May 20, 2013: Snowden arrives in Hong Kong from Hawaii. [3]
June 7, 2013: Greenwald publishes story in The Guardian. [3]
So the takeaway is that the NSA had almost six months to investigate or  nab Snowden from the time of his first attempt to contact Greenwald on Dec  1st 2012 until he was on a plane to Hong Kong on May 19th 2013.
Meanwhile he's running a large Tor exit node and organizing CryptoParties.

Reposted from NYPD STRIKE SUGGESTS ITâS TIME FOR ASSASSINATION MARKETS IF WE WON'T  ORGANIZE FOR NONVIOLENCE, WE'LL HAVE TO ORGANIZE FOR VIOLENCE
We should use political violence (preemptive and generalized violence  against a class of likely aggressors) against police. Thatâs what some  libertarians have been saying for years. I continue to reject this idea  but I have to give these folks their due â it worked in New York City.
A gunmanâs assassination of two NYC police officers while they sat in  their cruiser on December 20 has led to chaos in the NYC government.  Almost immediately:
citations for traffic violations fell by 94 percent;
summonses for low-level offenses dropped by 94 percent;
parking violations were down by 92 percent;
drug arrests by the NY Police Department (NYPD) Organized Crime Control  Bureau plummeted 84 percent;
cops received orders to only work in pairs and not even take breaks alone;
police union officials told fellow officers to not make arrests âunless  absolutely necessaryâ â thus calling into question the legitimacy of their  normal arresting habits â and claimed they were on wartime footing;
cops from across the country traveled to NYC to attend the funeral,  evidence of the wide psychological impact of the assassinations;
infighting between the NYPD and the NYC mayor escalated, damaging the  effectiveness of the NYC government.
THE DROP IN ARRESTS
The overall drop in arrests, at 66 percent, in the week following the  assassinations is nothing short of jaw-dropping. How is it that the NYPD  could effectively go on strike and yet the city is not tearing itself  One reason may be that the general public is also horrified by the  violence and people are behaving themselves better out of deference to the  cops. Another is that people are on better behavior because they are  afraid of overreaction on the part of paranoid police. Every cop out there  may be ready to issue beatings and bullets for even the lowliest of  infractions (as if they werenât already).
But I think the reality is actually that most of these arrests are for  penny-ante, mostly-victimless crimes. Theyâre about making NYC a more  pleasant place to live and visit for tourists and those who are well-off.  The crimes people were being cited and caged for represent no real threat  to the peace. Those minor infractions are also about filling the coffers  of the NYC government revenue machine through fines and fees.
INTRA-GOVERNMENTAL STRIFE
John Robbâs first rule of open source warfare is to break networks. This  lone gunman inadvertently did that by leading the NYPD and the mayor into  greater confrontation, so much so that the cops turned their backs en  masse on their boss, the mayor, in a public gathering that made headlines.
Whatâs more, the gunman did this without any conscious attempt to maximize  such damage and with the meager investment of a pistol, ammunition and  transportation to NYC. Who knows how much the executions and their  aftermath have cost the city of New York and police across the nation, but  the return on investment (ROI) for this execution must be high.
If the gunman spent $2,000 to carry this attack out, and the cost in  financial outlays, loss of government revenue (due to reduced ticketing),  police peace of mind and other intangibles is $20 million, thatâs a 10,000  percent ROI.
A LIBERTARIAN ANALYSIS
In the short term, libertarians may feel the urge to cheer the gunman. But  you shouldnât. Executing members of a group for the perceived crimes of  the whole, or of certain members of the group, is rank collectivism. It  stinks. Libertarianism is individualism. Collectivism is the opposite of  our philosophy.
This kind of collectivist anti-cop vigilantism could easily get out of  hand. Careless, suicidal vigilantes could shoot innocent bystanders.  Paranoid cops could overreact even more than they already do and kill even  more people than they already do. Then what? Civil war on the streets?  Nobody wants that.
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR PUBLIC ORDER
Even in a libertarian society, stateless or not, you need law and order.  People need to know that those who break the rules will be stopped and  made to pay for their destructive actions. Without that, society doesnât  work. The lawless cause more disturbances and the lawful look for other  solutions or other places to go.
Random murders and police going on strike or engaging in work slowdowns is  a recipe for societal breakdown. Libertarians are wise to condemn both  equally, while demanding the continued reduction in harassment of people  accused of committing victimless crimes.
WHAT ABOUT IN A STATELESS SOCIETY?
In a stateless libertarian society, there are multiple police, or private  defense, agencies in operation in a city the size of New York. If an  employee of one agency is assassinated, itâs likely that employees of all  of the agencies would engage in acts of solidarity with the fallen  But itâs unlikely that all of the agencies would go on strike, at least  not all at the same time. Unlike the NYPD, which is centrally controlled  by its commissioner and the mayor above him, private defense agencies are  each independent and free from coercive outside control. Different  agencies would likely make different decisions on the question of whether  to strike or not.
Itâs possible that all of the individual employees of all of these  agencies would be members of the same union, or a tight group of unions.  That union could go on strike and force a work stoppage or slowdown  similar to what is taking place in NYC. But, in a stateless society, the  private defense agencies could just as easily fire or furlough their  current employees and hire new ones who recognized the need to keep  working, or just needed the work. These new ones could be experienced  security agents from out of town or recently-retired former employees.
The NYPD doesnât enjoy that kind of flexibility. It is owned and  controlled by the local government, the same entity that promulgates the  laws that make it difficult, if not impossible to fire government  employees for striking. Even without these troublesome laws, politicians  dare not act definitively against a striking police union because the  cops, their friends, family and supporters will vote against them in an  upcoming election. Private defense agencies donât have that concern,  though they would have to worry about losing customers who disapproved of  their mass firing or furloughing of their employees.
Itâs also likely that there would not be just one, massive police union,  or tightly-coordinated group of unions. With multiple private defense  agencies, the need for a unified negotiating position would likely be  The bottom line is that a legal police monopoly â the NYPD â makes the  residents of NYC more vulnerable to crime. This one organization can go on  strike, or a slowdown, and it threatens the security of the entire city  because there is no competition to pick up the slack â that competition is  legally banned. In a stateless society, however, if one private defense  agency shuts down, there is a strong incentive for the others to ramp up  their operations, in order to collect the customers of the agency that  shut down.
This analysis doesnât even take into account the fact that competitive  private defense agencies will not enjoy de facto immunity from  accountability for their crimes. Without that special privilege, bad cops  will be held accountable for their actions. Societal rage against bad cops  will be assuaged by removing this special protection and the motivation  for collectivist vigilantism against cops will be removed.
LESSONS FOR LIBERTARIANS
The aftermath of the assassinations is a clear sign that assassination is  an effective tool, at least in the short term, in the fight to control  police abuse. Police activity is down, cops are scared and the cops and  mayor are at war. I take no pleasure in saying that because it appears to  validate the strategy of fellow libertarian activist Christopher Cantwell  â not one of my favorite people.
Given that cops across the country have shown themselves, time and time  again, to be unaccountable killers, it makes no sense to take this kind of  abuse lying down. Itâs only reasonable to take steps to protect oneself   from police abuse and fraud. I choose the nonviolent route because I am  certain that the violent one will backfire. Already, family and friends of  cops are organizing in support of police officers across the country.  Violence is a polarizing tactic that you donât come back from.
But I believe in organization. If folks are going to advocate for  political violence against police, then at least get the damned thing  organized so it has a chance of success. Assassination Politics is  essential reading in this area. In fact, an assassination marketplace  already exists behind Tor on the Darknet.
So, if people like Cantwell are serious about killing cops, why donât they  actively promote assassination marketplaces? Why donât they create more  marketplaces, add more targets and run marketing campaigns for them? Why  the gratuitous chatter and the lack of sustained efforts toward their  stated goal?
Itâs likely that at least a small amount of targeted violence will be  required to take down governments, so that a more liberty-centric order  can supplant them. If we accept that, as distasteful as it is, then  assassination marketplaces become attractive. Unlike a traditional war,  assassination marketplaces donât require that you kill tens of thousands  of cops, politicians and soldiers. In order for assassination marketplaces  to end the age of the state, only a few targeted individuals need be  killed. For the rest, active and well-funded threats may be sufficient to  intimidate aggressors into remaining peaceful while an organized  resistance takes voluntary civil institutions to the next level.
This idea of keeping cops in check by placing bounties on their heads is  nothing new. Pablo Escobar used it in MedellÃ­n to great effect. The IRA  used it in Ireland. States are masters at this tactic, both against  accused criminals and against insurgencies, such as Alvaro Uribeâs  bounties on FARC members in Colombia in the last decade. It works.
If the libertarian communities can ever get our collective acts together,  someday we may be negotiating with police unions. We will want them to  stop enforcing victimless crimes and to cooperate with the liberalization  of their sector by accepting competition â the end to their monopoly. When  negotiating with armed and dangerous paramilitary forces, itâs wise to  operate from a position of strength. Assassination markets are one vector  for gaining that kind of negotiating position. We would be wise to explore  our options in that area.
Violence is distasteful. But death and ignominious caging are worse.  Libertarians have to be realistic. We can never secure our desired  libertarian future from a position of weakness and disorganization. If  weâre unable or unwilling to organize for nonviolent action, then we will  have to organize for violent action. The alternative to either of these  options, a wait-and-see, hemming-hawing, pacifistic apathy, is even more  repugnant than violence.
A PERSONAL NOTE
Itâs tasteless to rejoice in the death of other people, no matter the evil  of their actions while alive. Every human life is precious, even those  spent in misguided pursuits like being a US Marshal, a congressperson,  bureaucrat or a NYC cop because any of those lives can be redeemed at any  moment and put to great use. See, for example, retired Philadelphia police  captain Ray Lewis.
I am sympathetic to the families of the assassinated officers. No one  wants to lose a loved one like that. No one wants to die like that,  without even a chance to defend themselves. But such feelings must never  get in the way of speaking the truth.

{direct link: cryptostorm.org/balrog}
This essay forms one section of a broader paper describing a global  surveillance technology we have dubbed Corruptor-Injector Networks (CINs,  or "sins") here at cryptostorm. As we have worked on the drafting and  editing of the larger paper, we saw as a team the need for a first-hand  perspective to help provide a tangible sense of how CINs work and why  understanding them is so vitally important to the future of network  I was nominated to write the first-person account, in large part because I  have spent the better part of two months entangled with a particular CIN  ("painted" by it - i.e. targeted). That experience, it was decided, may  prove helpful for readers as it represents what is likely to be a  nearly-unique frontline report from someone who is both engaged in  research in this field as a professional vocation, and who was personally  painted by the preeminent CIN in the world today. Despite misgivings about  revisiting some of this experience, I see the wisdom in this decision and  here I am pecking away at this esay. It's late, as I've found it a  challenge to comport my experience with a cohesive, easily-digested  narrative arc. What follows is the best I'm able to do, when it comes to  sharing that experience in a way that is intended to help others.
Specifically, I hope to accomplish two things. One, and most importantly,  I am sharing what amounts to loosely-defined diagnostic criteria for those  concerned they have been painted by a CIN... or who are in a later-stage  state of deeply-burrowed infection by the CINs implants. In the last month  or so, I have been deluged by people concerned they may be targeted or  infected. While I have done my best to reply with useful advice our  counsel, more often than not I've been unable to provide much of either.  This essay is my attempt to fill that gap.
Apart from the designers and operators of this CIN, I am likely more  familiar with the operational details if it as it exists today than anyone  else in the world - by a long stretch. I have invested many hundreds of  deep-focus hours in this work, with only a small minority of that being  solely directed at disinfecting my - and our - machines locally, at  cryptostorm. The majority has involved, to be blunt, using myself as an  experimental subject... allowing my local machines to reinfect via the  painting profile, and then trying to limit the spread of, and eventually  revers the footorint of, the infection modules/payloads themselves. I have  iteratively followed that painting-injection-infection-corruption  trajector through dozens of iterations, countless kernels rotted from the  inside-out and simply erased as they were beyond salvation. This knowledge  base all but obligates me to share what I have learned, such as it is, so  others can leverage the hard-won bits of insight I've been able to collate   from all this dirty tech.
The second goal of this paper is to communicate the scale, scope, and  pressing urgency of CINs as a research and mitigation subject of highest  priority to anyone working in the information security field today. That's  a big task. I will do my best to share the broad outline of what we, at  cryptostorm, have watched accelerate into the biggest, most dangerous,  most complex threat we see to internet security and privacy for the next  five years.
Let's get to work.
& crypto really is finished.
...once we finish this amble,
...that conclusion is inescapable,
...its consequences both subtle & profound.
Õ forest, trees, & the sum of parts
It wouldn't be too far-fetched to say that info security is a solved  problem, or was before the CINs implanted themselves in the middle of  things. That sounds bizarre to say, since by all accounts the State of  InfoTec is... abyssmal. Stuff is broken, everywhere; everything gets  hacked by everyone, all the time. Nobody follows good security procedure,  and the net result veers between chaos and satire. That's all true, no  question - but in theoretical terms, I stand by the assertion that infosec  was essentially solved. How to implement those solution compoments...  well, that's different question entirely.
When it comes to understanding how to mitigate, manage, and monitor  security issues in technology, we know how: every attack vector has its  defensive tools that, if applied correctly, pretty much work. This state  of affairs is so ingrained in our thinking, from within infosec, that it's  tough to step back and really see how prevasive it is. As much as we all  know there's horrible implementation failure out there, nobody is (or was)  home alone late at night, wringing hands and sighing dejectedly... utterly  stumped by a question of how to defend against a particular attack.  Rather, a few minutes perusing InfoSec Taylor Swift's twitter feed... err  I mean "searching the web," is enough to turn up some pretty solid  knowledge on any imaginable infosec topic, from post-quantum cryptographic  systems to gritty OpSec-spy advice, and off to baked-in processor hardware  attack models. Winnow down the advice to the stuff that seems legit,  figure out the cost and complexity of putting it in production, and off we  go. This we all assume is simply the lay of the land in our corner of the  Corruptor-Injector networks throw that somewhat comfortable state of  affairs on its head in a rude, unsettling, and comprehensive way.
This is a qualitatively different sort of security threat than is, for  example, "malware" or "the fast-approaching arrival of engineered AES128  collisions" - CINs are as different from such componentry as is a castle   from a jumble of uncut boulders sitting in a field. All the expertise out  there, developed to thwart countless sub-sub categories of security  threats to computers and the networks we use to connect them, finds itself  marooned in the dry terrain of "necessary, but not sufficient." That is to  say, we will need all those skills to avoid an otherwise-eventual  "CINtastrophe" in which the sticky extremeties of fast-mutating, competing  CINs drown the internet in a morass of corrupted data, broken routes,  unstable connections, and infected packets. But we'll also need more.
Which is the first important point in all of this, and one it took me more  than a month of more-than-fulltime study of this subject to finally  realise in one of those "oh, wow... now I get it" moments. I'm going to  boldface this, as it's a core fact: no individual functional component of  CINs is - or need be - new, or unknown, or freshy-discovered, or  surprisingly clever and far ahead of the curve in its specialised explot  category. It's all alread seen, observed, documented, and on most all  cases, reasonably well understood in the civilian world. Cryptostorm has  not, nor do we claim to have, "discovered a new exploit" or attack vector  that nobody has previously noted or published. The sense of urgency and...  dread (not the right word, but it'll do for now) we feel and are  communicating recently isn't based on a novel discovery.
Even more so, the entire concept of CINs - if not the name itself - and  the example of one created by the NSA, were thrown into stark, inescapably  real status by the whistleblowing of Edward Snowden in 2013. There's a  hefty pile of NSA slide decks, and civilan commentary, freely available to  confirm that's the case (we're collecting it all in the closing segment of  this full essay, as well as in our newly-birthed community research  library. It's all there, in black and white... nearly two years ago, with  additional follow-on disclosures continuing along the way.
So if that's the case, why are we all hot & bothered at cryptostorm about  CINS? After all, they're neither made of new pieces nor even a  newly-discovered category themselves - nothing to see, move right along.  I'll admit that I was, unconsciously, in that mindset abou this segment of  the Snowden archives. I read them - skimmed, more like - and essentially  filed them under the "interesting, but not core" tag in my internal filing  model. Yes, malware... you get it, bad things happen. Don't click on dodgy  links, or download "free" porn. There are pages about injectors and  FoxAcid, and QuantumInsert, and so on... but it all seemed mostly  Tor-specific and anyway not terribly front & centre. I say this not  because I misunderstood the mechanisms - MiTM is not a new concept for any  of us on the team, here - but rather because I miss the implictions  We all did, or nearly all. That's despite Snowden himself taking some  effort to return focus to this category, even as we all hared off into  various sub-branches of our own particular desire: crypto brute-forcing,  mass interception, hardware interdiction and modification, and so on. Not  surprisingly, Mikko (Hypponen) calls out as something of a lone voice, in  his early-published quotes on these attack tools, in really clearly  pointing out that there's something fundamentally different about this  stuff. Here he is, from March of 2014, in The Intercept:
"âWhen they deploy malware on systems,â Hypponen says, âthey potentially  create new vulnerabilities in these systems, making them more vulnerable  for attacks by third parties.â Hypponen believes that governments could  arguably justify using malware in a small number of targeted cases against  adversaries. But millions of malware implants being deployed by the NSA as  part of an automated process, he says, would be âout of control.â âThat  would definitely not be proportionate,â Hypponen says. âIt couldnât  possibly be targeted and named. It sounds like wholesale infection and  wholesale surveillance.â
[b"]Wholesale infection."[/b] That's the visible symptom, and it's the  sharp stick in the eye that I needed to break my complacency. Mikko calls  this category "disturbing" and warns that it risks "undermining the  security of the Internet." That's no hyperbole. In fact, the observable  evidence of that critical tipping-point having already been crossed is  building up all around us.
All this doom-and-gloom from something that doesn't really have any new  parts, and has been outed to public visibility for years... how can that  be? CINs are powerful because of their systems-level characteristics, not  (merely) because of their fancy building blocks. Just like the castle,  vastly more useful as a defensive tool than a big pile of boulders, CINs  take a bunch of building blocks and create an aggregated system ouf of  them that's of a different order entirely.
The forest is greater than the sum of the trees, in other words. Much  ÕÕ "...proceed with the pwnageâ
âJust pull those selectors, queue them up for QUANTUM, and proceed with  the pwnage,â the author of the posts writes. (âPwnage,â short for âpure  ownage,â is gamer-speak for defeating opponents.) The author adds,  triumphantly, âYay! /throws confetti in the air.â
One of the things we know - or knew, really - about infosec is what it  means to be "infected" with "malware" or "badware" or whatever term is  enjoying its 15 PFS re-keyings of fame. You do something dumb, like stick  a big wiggly floppy drive into your TRS-80 that you got from some shady  dude at the local BBS meet-up, and now you "have it." The virus. It's in  your computer...
If you do silly-dumb things and bad stuff gets into your computer, then  you have to... get it out of your computer, of course. A entire industry  (dubious as it is) exists to keep bad things from getting in - "antivirus"  - and a parallel sub-industry specialises (not terribly successfully) in  getting it out when it gets in. THis same model scales up to corporate  entites, except it all costs alot more money for the same  not-really-effective results. Firewalls keep bad stuff out, and scanners  find it when it gets in so it can get removed.
Simple - even if tough to do in practice. CINs are different.
It took me most of a month to figure this out, too. At first, in early  March, I noticed odd browser activity in several machines I'd been using  to do research and fine-tuning for our torstorm gateway. I whipped out my  analyzers and packet-grabbers and browser-session sniffers, and got to  work figuring out what had infected the machines. Because that's how this  works: if you are unlucky or unwise, you disinfect. It's tedious and not  always totally successful, but it isn't complex or intellectually  challenging. Indeed, I was quite sure I knew with some precision what  vector had infected me - and I had (still have) the forensics to  demonstrate it. Feeling a bit smug, I took the weekend to collate data,  write up some findings, clean the local network, and prepare to pat myself  on the back for being such an InfoSec Profesional.
Then the weird stuff started happening again, on the computer I'd somewhat  meticulously "cleaned" of any odd tidbits. Hmm, ok. I suck at hardware, as  everyone knows, so clearly I just didn't do a good job of disinfecting -  this is not unusual. Back to the salt mines, to disinfect again. This time  I roped in most all of the rest of the cryptostorm staff computers, to  disinfect those... a security precaution in case I gave what I had to  others on the team, somehow. I still didn't really know what it was doing  ("it") in the browser, specifically... but who cares? Wipe the browser to  the bare earth, or if needed reinstall the entire OS image ground-up.  Problem not. Done.
I took the opportunity of this extravagant downtime - nearly a whole week  without being on the computer for academic or cryptostorm work, amazing! -  to pick up a new laptop. Actually new, in the box - something odd for me,  as I tend towards ragged conglomerates of old machines. Once again feeling  smug, I laid out some elegant UEFI partitions - tri-boot, look at me being  all tech! Packages updated, repositories lovingly pruned and preened with  bonsai attention. I left the drives from the old infected machines, in my  local network, off in a pile for later analysis and file removal. Safety  first, right? No way this nasty stuff will jump onto the new, "clean"  boxes I've spent days setting up.
Then the new box went weird, all at once. Not just one partition, either:  I'd boot into Win and sure enough the browser would get baulky and jagged  and cache-bloated if I hopped around to a few sites... not even the same  sites I'd visited when I was in the lenny partition.. That matters,  because we assume - unconsciously - that we get infected from a specific  site. It's got bad files on the server, you visit the server, and you have  those files come down to your machine via your browser. Maybe it's a  creepy flash file making use of the endless deluge of flash 0days, or  whatever. The file comes from a server.
But I didn't visit any of the same sites, on these different operating  systems I'd just used on my new laptop... not an intentional choice, but  looking back I knew it was a clean split between the two groups of sites.  But now I certainly seemed to have the same problem on a brand-new,  well-tightened (as much as one can, because WIndows) OS instance - with no  overlap in sites visited. That's sort of weird, isn't it?
Well, ok... thinking... hmmm. And as I'm thinking, the Windows partition  locks up tight. No surprise there, it happens... though with only a couple  plain-jane websites loaded in Firefox? On a brand-new laptop? Odd, but  whatever: Windows. Reboot, and it'll be happy once again.
I push the power button to reboot the laptop. It powers off, by all  appearances... and then simply sits like turd in the hot sun. It's a  new-fangled laptop, no way to do anything to it but push the power button.  Heck even the battery is locked inside tight. I push, and push, and  push... nothing. And my mind is repeating two words: fucking hardware.  Hardware is the bane of my existence. Two days old, and a new laptop won't  even power up. Hardware and I have a fraught relationship. I go through  the grief stages, sort of... first is denial - it can't be broken, no way!  - and then the next one is anger - damned piece of garbage, amazing how  shoddy things are!
...I think there's three more stages, but I don't remember them because I  was so pissed off.
Also the laptop got a bit dented-up along the way. I was frustrated: a  week's worth of fiddling with hardware and kernels, and I was one step  backwards from where I'd begin. No stable partition. No stable local  machines, known-clean. No real idea of the infection vector, as my assumed  model wasn't doing well as new data arrived. Plus now I just had an angry  shouting match with a laptop that won't boot (not much shouting from that  side of things)... this is really, really not me at all. But I'm feeling,  at that point, a powerlessness... a sense of non-confidence in my own  ability to run a computer. This might be like a truck driver who suddenly  forgets how to operate the transmission in her daily driver: really  humiliating, and self-eroding, isn't it?
In the dozen or two cases of people I've talked to who also have been  painted by this CIN, that powerlessness feeling is a universal marker.  Many are high-level tech notables, and the concept of not being able to  make a computer run cleanly is... utterly foreign. As a group, we're the  kids who built computers from blurry blueprints published in Byte  magazine, metaphorically speaking. We not only fix computers for friends  and family when they won't work, we're the ones who the people who first  tried to fix them come to when they can't fix them. It's been like that  all our lives. It's sort of who we are, at some level.
And then there's these computers sitting in front of us that don't work.  Or, they work for a while - a few days, maybe - and then they start  sliding downhill. Browser slows, then gets GPU/CPU intensive. Lots of  activity from it, even when no page loads are happening visibly - or maybe  only a tab or two are open. Bidirectional traffic, noted by most of us who  ifconfig'd or nload'd or iptraf'd the boxes when things took a strange  Next, graphical irregularities that go beyond the browser. Fonts aren't  rendering quite right... or if they do, they render well but have these  "slips" where they get a bit pixellated... but only for a minute or ten,  and they come back. Those of us attuned to such things note that strange  tls/ssl errors spin up: mismatched certs, subtle but if one's browser is a  bit snooty about credentials, they appear. Maybe a certificate for a site  that doesn't match the site's URL... well ok not uncommon, except in these  cases it's for sites that we know have matching certs, to the character.  But they're transient.
Wireshark it. But.. wireshark crashes. Update wireshark... and suddently  you find yourself downloading a really big package relative to what you  are pretty sure a basic wireshark binary should be. You google that, to  confirm... and as you do, you notice that there's a bunch of other  packages hitching a ride on that wireshark update... how'd that happen?  More googling, but as you do, your machine is doing stuff. Htop and...wtf?  Lots of new processes, not stuff you are used to seeing. Bluetooth? You  disabled it ages ago. Avahi... what the hell is that? Cups? I don't even  own a printer.
You google each one, and they're legit packages... but packages you've  never intentionally installed or configured. And no big version upgrades  lately, to the kernel, either... hmmm. Look at the config files for these  unexpected arrivals - eeek! Ports open, remote debugging activated...  that's not default settings, and you sure as heck didn'[t set those, did  you? Meanwhile the CPU is hot, the hard disk platters are spinning  continuously, and the blinkenlight on the NIC is a solid LED.
Those who are reading this and have experienced some or all of that, you  know what I'm describing. You can feel your OS eroding out from underneath  you... but how to stop it? And how did it get in, since that's a new  machine with no hardware in common with the old (infected) ones. Perhaps  you go on a config jijad, like I did (many times): manually reviewing  every config file of every bloody package on the bloody machine, and  manually resetting to values you think sound legit... because who can  google them all? Packages crash, you didn't set values right. Reading,  googling, page 7 of the search results and still nobody will just post the  syntax that made the damned whatever-it-is do its thing without barfing!
...what did you see??!?
Ah, yes, now you're feeling the burn. If you looked in cache (or Cache, or  Media Cache - wtf? - or .cache, or...) you see gigabytes of weirdly  symmetrical, hard-symmetric-encrypted blobs overflowing, in all  directions. Purge cache, and it builds back up. Plug the NIC in, and  traffic screams out... you didn't even up the adapter yet! And is that  your wifi adapter chattering away? That was disabled, too...
Eventually you reboot yet one more time, and the grub menu is... not the  same. You run grub2/pc, and this is old-skool grub, or whatever. Is your  kernel image listed differently? No way... that's not possible. You  mention these odd things to colleagues or friends, and they rib you about  it: "stop clicking on porn, and you won't get infected again!" But you  actually didn't... which is troubling in all sorts of ways.
Read boot logs closely, and you might see paravirtualisation come up.  And/or KVM. If you run windows, the equivalent there. But you didn't  install a virtualised kernel. Maybe you are like me, and you get downright  obsessive about this: iterate through possible infection mechanisms,  between boxes. Calculate RFC ranges for NFC devices you know are disabled,  but who knows..? Consider that air-gapped subsonic infection magic that at  first seemed legit, then got pissed all over, but is almost certainly  legit and was alll along... do you need to actually find a Faraday cage to  put your computer in?
Unplug from the network entirely, hard-down adapters at the BIOS. Machine  is stable. OK. But... useless, right? DIsable IP6, wreck bluetooth  physically with a screwdriver, read up in WiMax and all that weird  packet-radio stuff (there goes a weekend of your life you'll never get  back). Start manually setting kernel flags, pre-compile... only to see the  "new" initrd image hash-match to the infected one. Learn about  config-overrides, and config-backups, and dpkg-reconfigure, and apt-cache,  and... there's a few more weeks.
Plug back into the internet after all that - static IP on a baseline wired  ip4 NIC, no DHCP packages even installed, ffs! - first packet goes to  cstorm to initiate a secure session. Rkhunter at the ready, unhide(s)  spooled up... iptraf running, tcpdump dumin'... an hour later, having  logged in to a couple sites to check week's worth of backlogged  correspondence, and the browser starts slowing. Task manager shows big  caches of javascript and CSS and images and... oh, no. Check your browser  config files, manually - the ones you manually edited for hours last  night, and set chattr +i. They're reverted somehow. There's a proxy  enabled, and silent extensions with no names and no information when you  look for matches by their thumbprints.
Kill your browser with pkill -9... but the browser in your window is still  there. htop.... is that legit, or is that a remote xterm session? Why is  sshd running? Who enabled Atari filesystem, ffs!
So it goes...
ÕÕÕ âOwning the Netâ
In the first week or two after I got painted, I stuck the name of  "SVGbola" on the malware I had captured... because .svg-format font files  are one of the mechanisms used for the initial inject of targeted network  sessions, and because ebola ofc. But quickly I saw that there were other  vectors, they seemed to evolve over time. I'd block or disable or find a  way to mitigate one clever ingress tactic, and a few hours later I'd see  the telltale cache-and-traffic stats begin climbing... not again. Two or  three days of frantic battle later, and I'd learned about a couple more  attack/inject tactics, but still had no damned idea what tied them together
I'd intentionally been avoiding reading those old NSA slide decks, as I  didn't want to taint my perceptions with a "one holds a hammer, and the  world become a nail" dynamic. But it was time to dig into the literature  (using a borrowed touchpad... I'd borrowed a few laptops along the way,   from friends and colleagues, to use for some simple email and web tasks...  and managed to brick the hard drives on every single one), and refresh my  memory on this whole "weird NSA MiTM malware" cul-de-sac.
It didn't take long at all...
The NSA began rapidly escalating its hacking efforts a decade ago. In  2004, according to secret internal records, the agency was managing a  small network of only 100 to 150 implants. But over the next six to eight  years, as an elite unit called Tailored Access Operations (TAO) recruited  new hackers and developed new malware tools, the number of implants soared  to tens of thousands. {article date: March 2014}
I had been assuming Stuxnet, in terms of initial infection vector... you  know, a USB stick with sharpie writing on the side that says: PR0N, DO NOT  OPEN!!! <-- that is how you get malware, right? ( speaking metaphorically,  sort of)
But this isn't what the NSA is doing with these programs, not at all.
They're selecting targets for injection of malware into live network  sessions - apparently http/https overwhelmingly - on the fly, at "choke  points" where they know the targets' sessions will go by the hundreds of  machines that compromise these NSA 'malnets.' Custom-sculpted nework  injections (we call them 'session prions') are forced in, seething with  0days. An analyst in some post-Snowden NSA office tomb clicks a few GUI  elements on her display and the selector logic she was fed by her bosses  primes the Quantum and Foxacid malnets worldwide, waiting for that  signature'd session to show up on their targeting radar.
You've been CIN-painted.
Now, whenever your sessions match that profile, you will get more Foxacid  Alien-implant session payloads coming back from your routine internet  activities. The selectors can be anything that identifies you as a general  profile... the slide decks mention things like Facebook tracking  fingerprints, DoubleClick leech-cookies, twitter oauth header snippets,  and so forth. Physical IP is entirely unnecessary, as is your name or any  other identifier.
Perhaps the NSA (or its clients in the civilian law enforcement world, in  dozens of countries) wants to find out who runs a particular website...  say, a .onion website like agorahooawayyfoe.onion...

This isn't a small-scale effort any more, either. That's what I think I  had unconsciously assumed, that it was a couple hundred people on the  Amerikan drone-list, or whatever. Not making light of such things, but  rather for me as a technologist if an attack is bespoke and requires  expertise, it limits it to a tiny, tiny percent of defensive threat  modelling scenarios. And for those on the drone-lists? Well, good luck is  what I'd generally say.
However, these CIN malnets are scaling/scaled to millions of concurrent  painted-chumps. And growing.
The implants being deployed were once reserved for a few hundred  hard-to-reach targets, whose communications could not be monitored through  traditional wiretaps. But the documents analyzed by The Intercept show how  the NSA has aggressively accelerated its hacking initiatives in the past  decade by computerizing some processes previously handled by humans. The  automated system â codenamed TURBINE â is designed to âallow the current  implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating  a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of  In a top-secret presentation, dated August 2009, the NSA describes a  pre-programmed part of the covert infrastructure called the âExpert  System,â which is designed to operate âlike the brain.â The system manages  the applications and functions of the implants and âdecidesâ what tools  they need to best extract data from infected machines. {ibid.}
Or for another way of saying it in the NSA's own words, dating from 2009...
ÕÕÕÕ Åame your poison
Once I realised this was about quite a bit more than simply borked svg's  (which is still a pretty interesting vector, imho), I pulled out the name   for what I was experiencing: a totalising, all-seeing,  ever-present, burning glare from a height. I was being surveilled, by some  entity somewhere, for some reason. The pressure of the eye was almost  physical, for those middle weeks.
But the name doesn't seem to fit, now that we've been able to fit the  scrambled, jagged mess of data-pieces together into a more or less  fully-coherent understanding of what the system is. Because this stuff  isn't passive it doesn't simply sit there and watch. Rather, it's 'all up  in your shit,' as they say... every time you get online, however innocuous  and carefully-constrained your activities are, you run the risk of this  happening to your browser once those prions spread through your network  session and shoot right into your local kernel:
A colleague, overhearing us discussing this amoungst the team, blurted out  "Balrog." And that's the fit, just so. Yes, it's LoTR and that's drifted  twee of late - but at core Tolkein isn't twee, and he knew his evil as  only an Oxford professor of decrepit languages can know evil.
The Balrog, for the less painfully geeky amoungst the readership, are  described by JRR as "they can change their shape at will, and move unclad  in the raiment of the world, meaning invisible and without form" (cite),  which gets it spot-on for our CIN-naming task here. He goes on, waxing a  bit more poetical...
His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out  like two vast wingsâ¦ suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its  wings were spread from wall to wallâ¦
Shadowy? Check. Great height, and wide (metaphorical) wingspan? Check. But  it's the imagery of the Balrog that seared the name into the very souls of  Tolkein-reading boys such as I. Imagery that quite hits the nail on the  That's something of what it feels like to face down this stuff as it  repeatedly pierces one's local perimeter and turns one's root-level kernel  sanctuary into a mutating, unreliable, dishonest, corrupted mess... right  in front of one's eyes. (and yes, I know that computers behaving badly are  very much First World Problems of the most Platonic sort, and hyperbole  aside I remain aware that starvation trumps Cronenberg-transgressed  computational resources when it comes to real problems to have in one's  The final point, for this spot of writing, is this: there is no  "disinfecting" once you are painted as a target by Balrog (or any CIN).  The infection exist ephemerally in the fabric of the internet itself; it's  not something you can simply remove from your computer with antivirus  software (or manually). Trust me on this: even if you are successful in  disinfecting (and that'll require expertise in grub, Xen, containers,  obscure filesystem formats, font encoding, archaic network protocols down  the OSI stack, and on and on and on), dare to actually use the computer to  communicate with others online, and you'll be right back to the  alien-bursting-from-stomach place in short order.
Neither cryptostorm, nor cryptography, can protect you from Balrog, or   from CINs. The session prions come in via legitimate (-ish) web or network  activity. You can't blacklist the websites serving dirty files... because  they aren't coming from websites, these prions. They're phantom-present  everywhere in the internet that's a couple hops from a Foxacid shooter...  wihich means everywhere, more or less. You can blacklist the internet, I  suppose - offline yourself to stay pure... but that in and of itself  reflects a successful DoS attack by the NSA: they downed you, forever...
I can hear the grumbling from the stalwarts already: "BUT WHAT ABOUT  HTTPS??!?! IT'S SUPER-SECURE AND INVINCIBLE AND SO NSA CAN SUCK EGGS I'M  SAFE BECAUSE HTTPS EVERYWHERE WHOOOOOOO!!"
Https - as deployed, in the real world, based on tls & thus x509 &  Certification Authorities & Digicert & ASN.1 & parsing errors & engineered  'print-collisions & DigiNotar &  & all the rest - is so badly,  widely, deeply, permanently, irrecoverably broken on every relevant level  that it merely acts as a tool to filter out dumb or lazy attackers. Those  aren't the attackers we worry about much, do we?
I mean, if we put a lock on our door that would be totally effective in  keeping out newborn babies, caterpillars, and midsized aggregations of  Spanish Moss - but was useless against some dude who just hits the door  with his shoulder to pop it open - then it'd be less than wise to go  cavorting about the neighbourhood, crowing to all who can hear that you  left 500 pound sterling on the kitcken table and too bad suckers, no  mewling infant will ever find her way in to steal that currency...  wouldn't it?
That's https.
Indeed, I have a... something between a theory, and a strangely intense  fantasy... concept that PEM-encoded certs themselves are being used as an  implant vector by Balrog :-P Or, as my colleague graze prefers to (more  reasonably) suspect, strangely-formatted packets for use in transporting  data between Balrog-sickened victims and the MalCloud of Balrog's control  architecture, globally. Or maybe the're used as meta-fingerprints...  beyond-unicode control characters embedded in obscure fields nobody even  decodes client-side but which can be sniffed cross-site to identify  sessions over time...
Anyway, https. Were we to discover (or read the work of others who  discovered, more likely) super-exotic cert-vectored exploit pathways, we  would be not surprised in the least; it's not that it's 'only' marginally  useful in securing actual data (and network sessions) against CIN-level  active attackers, but rather it's a question of how destructive it is, on  balance. Alot, a little, or in the middle? That's an open question, but  it's the only one when it comes to https and security.
But remember, many keystrokes ago, we discussed "necessary but not  sufficient?" This is where it folds back in, like an origami crane tucked  in one's pocket...
The defensive techniques that can - and will - protect us from Balrog and  other CINs (there will be others, likely already are... that's a given),  systems-level infected-cloud virulence, must also act as integrated,  coherent, cohesive, outcomes-defined systems as well. Cryptography  (symmetric & asymmetric primitives alike) is a piece of that, a crucial  piece without which overall systems success would likely be impossible.
But crypto alone is no more protection from Balrog than would be a single  thick mitten serve as protection from a month in the Arctic during coldest  wintertimes. There's more, and more importantly it all needs to fit  together as a sum far greater than its parts: a big pile of right-handed  mittens won't substitute for a proper Inuit snow suit.
Funny thing is, we know how to do that - the systems stuff, the integrated  functionality. It's been where we've headed since last fall, perhaps  reflecting a team-wide intuition that our membership's needs were pulling  us that way. Too, we've been seeing the weirdness out there - fractal  weirdness on the network - for many months: borked routed, fishy certs,  dodgy packets, shifty CDNs, https being https, etc. Little fragments of  mysterious code piggybacking on "VPN service" installers (pretty sure we  know where some of that comes from now, eh?), microsoftupdate.com  hostnames used as C&C for... something? Repository pulls showing up  weird-shaped, with signed hashes to back their dubious claims to  legitimacy.... it goes on and on.
âLa semplicitÃ  Ã¨ la massima raffinatzzaâ (Åeonardo da Vinci)
CINs work by corrupting network integrity, at the most fundamental levels:  routing, packet integrity, DNS resolution, asymmetric session identity  validation. They use the trust we all have in those various systems more  or less working a they were designed to work, and as their maintainers  strive to enable them to work... they use that trust as a weapon against  everyone who uses the internet to communicate, from a father in Ghana  texting the family to find out what they'd like for dinner from town, to  the Chilean wind-farmer planning future blade geometries with  meteorological data available online, to the post-quantim information  theory doctoral student in Taiwan who runs her latest research results up  the flagpole with colleagues around the world, to see who salutes... all  get leeched, individually, so CINs can frolic about & implant malware as  their whims dicatate.
Galrog, and CINs generally, will prove to be our era's smallpox-infested  blankets dropped on trusting First Nation welcoming parties by white guys  behaving badly. We trust the internet to more or less inter-network, and  CINs use that trust as an ideal attack channel because who would really  Well, Balrog - this Balrog, not Tolkein's - is real. Funding is in the  order of $100 million USD a year and growing. It's been up and running a  decade or so, long since out of beta. There's other CINs in the works,  surely... if not deployed already regionally or in limited scale; When  more than one is shooting filth into whatever network sessions catch its  fancy, attribution will be hopeless. Its not like one checks ARIN for  Foxacid records, eh?

Assurance  that sessions go where intended, get there without fuckery, and come back  timely, valid, & clean.
One cannot simply 'clean' Balrog off, as the infection is entwined with  the internet itself.
Within that spreading rot, there exists the latent possibility of clean  secret pathways, reliable protected networks delivering assured transit  and deep-hardened privacy for every session, every packet, every bit... an  underground railroad of peaceful packets. Identifying and alerting to  network level threats is all well and good, but useless compared to threat  Done right, that kind of service delivery creates a  network-within-the-network, a sanctuary for people to talk and share and  live their lives with meaning, confidence, and peace.

Google Chrome Listening In To Your Room Shows The Importance Of Privacy  Defense In Depth
Yesterday, news broke that Google has been stealth downloading audio  listeners onto every computer that runs Chrome, and transmits audio data  back to Google. Effectively, this means that Google had taken itself the  right to listen to every conversation in every room that runs Chrome  somewhere, without any kind of consent from the people eavesdropped on. In  official statements, Google shrugged off the practice with what amounts to  âwe can do thatâ.
It looked like just another bug report. "When I start Chromium, it  downloads something." Followed by strange status information that notably  included the lines "Microphone: Yes" and "Audio Capture Allowed: Yes".
Without consent, Googleâs code had downloaded a black box of code that â  according to itself â had turned on the microphone and was actively  listening to your room.
A brief explanation of the Open-source / Free-software philosophy is  needed here. When youâre installing a version of GNU/Linux like Debian or  Ubuntu onto a fresh computer, thousands of really smart people have  analyzed every line of human-readable source code before that operating  system was built into computer-executable binary code, to make it common  and open knowledge what the machine actually does instead of trusting  corporate statements on what itâs supposed to be doing. Therefore, you  donât install black boxes onto a Debian or Ubuntu system; you use software  repositories that have gone through this source-code audit-then-build  process. Maintainers of operating systems like Debian and Ubuntu use many  so-called âupstreamsâ of source code to build the final product.
Chromium, the open-source version of Google Chrome, had abused its  position as trusted upstream to insert lines of source code that bypassed  this audit-then-build process, and which downloaded and installed a black  box of unverifiable executable code directly onto computers, essentially  rendering them compromised. We donât know and canât know what this black  box does. But we see reports that the microphone has been activated, and  that Chromium considers audio capture permitted.
This was supposedly to enable the âOk, Googleâ behavior â that when you  say certain words, a search function is activated. Certainly a useful  feature. Certainly something that enables eavesdropping of every  conversation in the entire room, too.
Obviously, your own computer isnât the one to analyze the actual search  command. Googleâs servers do. Which means that your computer had been  stealth configured to send what was being said in your room to somebody  else, to a private company in another country, without your consent or  knowledge, an audio transmission triggered byâ¦ an unknown and unverifiable  set of conditions.
Google had two responses to this. The first was to introduce a  practically-undocumented switch to opt out of this behavior, which is not  a fix: the default install will still wiretap your room without your  consent, unless you opt out, and more importantly, know that you need to  opt out, which is nowhere a reasonable requirement. But the second was  more of an official statement following technical discussions on Hacker  News and other places. That official statement amounted to three parts  (paraphrased, of course):
1) Yes, weâre downloading and installing a wiretapping black-box to your  computer. But weâre not actually activating it. We did take advantage of  our position as trusted upstream to stealth-insert code into open-source  software that installed this black box onto millions of computers, but we  would never abuse the same trust in the same way to insert code that  activates the eavesdropping-blackbox we already downloaded and installed  onto your computer without your consent or knowledge. You can look at the  code as it looks right now to see that the code doesnât do this right now.
2) Yes, Chromium is bypassing the entire source code auditing process by  downloading a pre-built black box onto peopleâs computers. But thatâs not  something we care about, really. Weâre concerned with building Google  Chrome, the product from Google. As part of that, we provide the source  code for others to package if they like. Anybody who uses our code for  their own purpose takes responsibility for it. When this happens in a  Debian installation, it is not Google Chromeâs behavior, this is Debian  Chromiumâs behavior. Itâs Debianâs responsibility entirely.
3) Yes, we deliberately hid this listening module from the users, but  thatâs because we consider this behavior to be part of the basic Google  Chrome experience. We donât want to show all modules that we install  If you think this is an excusable and responsible statement, raise your  hand now.
Now, it should be noted that this was Chromium, the open-source version of  Chrome. If somebody downloads the Google product Google Chrome, as in the  prepackaged binary, you donât even get a theoretical choice. Youâre  already downloading a black box from a vendor. In Google Chrome, this is  all included from the start.
This episode highlights the need for hard, not soft, switches to all  devices â webcams, microphones â that can be used for surveillance. A  software on/off switch for a webcam is no longer enough, a hard shield in  front of the lens is required. A software on/off switch for a microphone  is no longer enough, a physical switch that breaks its electrical  connection is required. Thatâs how you defend against this in depth.
Of course, people were quick to downplay the alarm. âIt only listens when  you say âOk, Googleâ.â (Ok, so how does it know to start listening just  before Iâm about to say âOk, Google?â) âItâs no big deal.â (A company  stealth installs an audio listener that listens to every room in the world  it can, and transmits audio data to the mothership when it encounters an  unknown, possibly individually tailored, list of keywords â and itâs no  big deal!?) âYou can opt out. Itâs in the Terms of Service.â (No. Just no.  This is not something that is the slightest amount of permissible just  because itâs hidden in legalese.) âItâs opt-in. It wonât really listen  unless you check that box.â (Perhaps. We donât know, Google just  downloaded a black box onto my computer. And it may not be the same black  box as was downloaded onto yours. )
Early last decade, privacy activists practically yelled and screamed that  the NSAâs taps of various points of the Internet and telecom networks had  the technical potential for enormous abuse against privacy. Everybody else  dismissed those points as basically tinfoilhattery â until the Snowden  files came out, and it was revealed that precisely everybody involved had  abused their technical capability for invasion of privacy as far as was  Perhaps it would be wise to not repeat that exact mistake. Nobody, and I  really mean nobody, is to be trusted with a technical capability to listen  to every room in the world, with listening profiles customizable at the  identified-individual level, on the mere basis of âtrust usâ.
Privacy remains your own responsibility.

============================== START ==============================
Reposted from  ** secure private reliable social networks: sprsn **
by Vinay Gupta â¢ December 29, 2014
sprsn is an idea for a small piece of software which I think would do the  world some good by existing, and which currently does not exist.
Itâs a deeply technical project that I probably donât have time to build  (unless somebody wants to pay my rent for a few months while I take a shot  at it with a helper or two! â I am not serious about this) but I can  describe whatâs needed and maybe it will inspire somebody, in whole or in  Synopsis: combine the new (telehash) with the old (SPKI) and get a  Facebook-killer in the form of a command line utility that provides a  decentralized social network. However, will Ethereum do this, and a ton  The dream

Now imagine that sprsn also has a web interface mode: sprsn -d 9999
 mounts a web interface to your local sprsn instance.  The sprsn instance connects to your (online) friends running sprsn using  telehash (a persistant DHT tool) for web chat and for key management:  click on your friendâs friends to acquire their keys, and multipath to  people (âyou have 9 friends in commonâ) to get more certainty about the  Obviously this would be great: the best of SSH and Facebook in a single  utility. It is now relatively easy to build.
Let me show you why it hasnât happened already, and why we need it!
The Problem
GPG and HTTPS (X509) are broken in usability terms because the conceptual  model of trust embedded in each network does not correspond to how people  actually experience the world. As a result, there is a constant grind  between people and these systems, mainly showing up as a series of user  interface disasters. The GPG web of trust results in absurd social  constructs like signing parties because it does not work and creating  social constructs that weird to support it is a sign of that: stand in a  line and show 50 strangers your government ID to prove you exist? Really?  Likewise, anybody whoâs tried to buy an X509 certificate (HTTPS cert)  knows the process is absurd: anybody whoâs really determined can probably  figure out how to fake your details if they happen to be doing this before  you do it for yourself, and of the 1500 or so Certificate Authorities  issuing trust credentials at least one is weak or compromised by a State,  and all your browser will tell you is âyes, I trust this credential  absolutely.â You just donât get any say in the matter at all.
The entirely manual, Byzantine process is broken, and so is the entirely  invisible, automated one. It just doesnât work. The process of mapping  keys to people is just broken and nearly all the rest of the trouble  emanates from this fact. A GPG key maps a person to an email address to a  key, and leaves you to pick who you trust enough to prove the map is  right. An HTTPS cert maps an organization to an IP address to a key, and  asks you to trust one of 1500 organizations your browser vendor chose to  trust. Itâs not just the trust model thatâs broken, itâs the binding of  these various pieces of data together using cryptography. Gluing the wrong  stuff to the wrong stuff produces constant security and reliability  Whatâs the wrong stuff? Legacy delivery mechanisms like email and DNS.  Mapping a person to an email address, and an email address to a key is two  mappings. Same for HTTPS where we map an organization to an IP address to  a key. Two mappings, one of which is essentially arbitrary: I care about  identity and key. I should not have to worry about IP address or email  address â thatâs a minor technical detail. But these outmoded trust  systems foreground it, much to our discomfort.
Enter Telehash, an encrypted network stack in which you route messages  directly to a public key. The code is pretty simple
mesh.receive(new Buffer("208cb2d0532f74acae82","hex"), pipe);
The cryptographic key is the routing address. So now we only have to  accomplish one level of indirection: person to key.
Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. Enter  SPKI and our old friend, the Granovetter diagram.
SPKI and trust in networks, not webs
Simple Public Key Infrastructure is what we should have deployed instead  of X509/HTTPS and the GPG web of trust. There are two critical differences  between SPKI and X509/GPG. They are:
1) SPKI gives users the ability to certify facts about other users, for  example âbob is allowed to use my computerâ can be expressed in a  machine-readable fashion (s-expressions.) This lets users build their own  trust architectures on an ad-hoc basis.
2) SPKI allows anybody to chain certificates of this type (âfred says that  bob says that vinay says that bob is allowed to use his computer.â) This  ability removes the centrality of the CA: anybody that I trust can give me  a certificate stating âthis is the key for amazon.comâ and because of  certificate chaining, I can see the line of authority down which that key  These might sound like minor features, but they are not: these two  features express the difference between trust-hierarchy (X509) and  trust-soup (GPG), neither of which are productive, and the  consumer-producer based trust-anarchy which SPKI permits and, indeed,  The best explanation of this in more detail is the Ode to the Granovetter  Diagram which shows how this different trust model maps cleanly to the  networks of human communication found by Mark Granovetter in his  sociological research. Weâre talking about building trust systems which  correspond to actual trust systems as they are found in the real world,  not the broken military abstractions of X509 or the flawed cryptoanarchy  of GPG.
Usable security is possible
Once you fix the trust model so that it works for humans, and use Telehash  to reduce the number of mappings from three (person -> delivery mechanism  -> key) to two (person -> key) itâs possible to imagine a secure system in  which people actually understand what is happening well enough feel  comfortable that they understand what is going on.
So letâs break this down into the desirable properties for the system weâd  build using these primitives.
For ease, letâs consider realtime chat in the first instance â just  pushing messages down telehash sockets. The only question we have to  answer is which telehash socket corresponds to which person.
1) person = key
thereâs no way to break the binding between a person and a key, because a  person is a key, or multiple keys.
2) delivery = key
this is what we get from telehash â I donât need to worry about how Iâm  sending you the message, itâs right there.
So I obtain a key for a friend of mine by, say, email. Once Iâve connected  to them, I can then ask them to send me keys for our mutual friends.
3) keys carry the chain of referrers
âalice says this is her keyâ
âbob says that alice says that this is her keyâ
âfred says that bob says that alice says that this is her keyâ
What that looks like in practice is a social graph, like the one embedded  in facebook. I click on you, my friend, and I click on alice, your friend,  and the connection that forms is an SPKI key being transferred to my  keyring. The key is its history â the path by which the key came to me is  the trust chain. If I want to be more sure the key I have is Aliceâs key  (and not your sockpuppet) I need to find an independent route or two to  If Google and Dunn & Bradstreet both agree that this key is the key for  the IRS, thatâs good enough for me.
4) tools and affordances
So how would we actually build this? I would recommend a golang  implementation for cross platform compatibility and ease of distribution.  NaCl and Telehash both exist for golang, and the self-contained binaries  which result are easy to spread around. A command line client would be  easy to augment with a web interface in which the golang program running  on localhost provides an HTTP interface for users that want graphics etc.
Basically you get a decentralized social network with secure chat pretty  much out of the box, where âfriendingâ somebody acquires their key, and  the referral network through which keys propagate is a key social dynamic.  This can work.
5) advanced topics
How do we message friends who arenât online? Store and forwards seems to  be the obvious approach. Suppose I create a certificate (âsignâ) which  lists a set of telehash keys that are my âstore and forwardâ servers â if  you try and chat to me and Iâm not there, you can ping one of them and  dump an (encrypted) message for me there and Iâll pick it up when Iâm  online again.
Same holds for large block transfer (i.e. dropbox) â I specify my choice  of servers by issuing a digital certificate. Do we need a central store of  those certificates? Maybe, or maybe itâs simply an addressing mechanism:  every time we chat, I push over my updated delivery info, and you can ask  your friends for my updated delivery info if you need to reach me.
In all probability, a decision has to be made about whether to keep the  old SPKI s-expression format for certificates, or move to JSON. Good luck  with that decision, itâs a hard one.
Thereâs no way to fix a broken conceptual model with a better user  GPG does not work for ordinary users, and GPG cannot work: weâve been  trying to fix this for 20 years and it has not happened. The process by  which humans communicate is not tractable using those trust primitives.
We are stuck with a mess, and X509 is not an answer either â it worked  when only big orgs wanted to secure their email and web sites, but now  everybody wants to do it and the certificate issuing mechanisms are  becoming far too sloppy to trust.
We have to go back 20 years to the brilliant analysis of the people who  did not ship a sloppy hack to quickly get to market but sat there and  figured out the right thing to do, if we want to fix this mess in a  durable way.
High roads and low roads
The high road on these issues is Ethereum.
Telehash takes the DHT and uses it for routing. Bitcoin takes the DHT and  adds proof of work to generate a history.
Ethereum takes bitcoin and puts executable contracts into the history,  plus protocols for chat and block transfer.
Itâs entirely possible that SPKI-style user-generated certificates will  make their way into Ethereum, either as part of the core spec or as a  common class of DAAPs. âI have bought stuff from bob and would do so  againâ can be issues as a certificate, in a standardized format, and these  certificates can be spidered out of the blockchain to generate trust  Likewise, if all your messaging is happening on the Ethereum protocol, you  do not necessarily need telehash.
Hereâs the question: is Ethereumâs âone ring to rule them allâ approach  feasible, or should we work closer to the Unix Philosophy and build  smaller pieces, loosely joined. I can imagine a command line Telehash/SPKI  client which is as commonly used as SSH is today, for slinging around chat  and small data.
I can also imagine an operating-system like sea of executable contracts  and helper functions in a densely knit global decentralized computational  ecosystem providing all the same services and more.
I, personally, am in favor of a mixed strategy. I think the sheer naked  moonshot ambition of Ethereum is extremely attractive, and part of the  reason I joined the team (F.I.S.T.) was that I wanted to be part of such  an ambitious vision.
But itâs an awful lot of bleeding edge tech, and with a project that large  and complex, you can never be quite sure what will come out the other end.  In particular, I have no idea whether the nuances of SPKI etc. which will  enable a revolution in the way that ordinary users experience cryptography  will show up in Ethereum in a usable way â the core smart contract etc.  functions can work perfectly well without fixing the nuances that  user-issued certificates will get.
So Iâm writing this post for two reasons: to encourage the Telehash  community to examine SPKI and look at it as a way of managing keys inside  of their DHT routing paradigm, and to encourage the Ethereum community to  look at SPKI and ask whether it might empower users within the larger  Ethereum landscape. Either way, I would dearly love to see an SPKI revival  so that, finally, at long last, pull the sword from the stone: Johnny can

Some knowledge of the major components of a modern computer and how they  fit together, but no detailed knowledge of firmware or hardware design is  The Snowden revelations demonstrated the lengths that government agencies  were willing and able to go to in order to subvert computers. But these  attacks arenât limited to state-level actors â security researchers  continue to demonstrate new vulnerabilities and weaknesses that would  permit sophisticated criminals to achieve the same goals.
In the face of these advanced attacks, what can we do to detect and  mitigate them? How can we make use of existing security features, and what  changes can we make to system design? In short, how can we ensure that a  user can trust that their computer is acting in their interests rather  than somebody elseâs?

Glad someone found it helpful. I've actually been meaning to post more  viewing notes along with interesting videos that I think are worth  sharing, with the aim of being more respectful of people's time. Still  working on the discipline to take notes while viewing.
It's a bit like disciplining yourself to take pictures when you're  traveling. There's always a feeling of "oh man, this is a hassle and I  just want to enjoy the moment without fussing with a camera." But you're  always glad you took pictures later on.
Regarding blocking of all things goog: Until I get my own MediaGoblin  instance up and running I can try repost videos on a service that's a tad  less an arm of the surveillance state. I was thinking of inserting the  content into the new Alexandria project. If you have any other suggestions  let me know.
Electricity is a unique commodity in that it's not that efficient to  store, so I can see the logit in trying to shift usage to off peak times.  The engineer Rob States from the other follow-up vid I posted says that  utilities could save 30% on power transmission by switching to  superconductor high tension lines.
Agree with all this. If you can grow a beard, start farming it! haha.
Time to start whipping up some suspicion and discontent with the peasants  beforehand, I'd say.
I would like to live in a culture of resistance where the prevalent  mindset is always "Hmm, big mega corp 'X' or gov is trying to roll out  such and such product/service/program/legislation. How are they trying to  fuck us in the ass this time?"
$50 a billing cycle is outrageous. Depending on the laws where you live,  you might be best served by communication your refusal via registered mail  or whatever the equivalent is in your area. Takebackyourpower.net has lots  of resources for how to properly serve the electrical company with a  refusal notice so that you will maintain the best legal position to  dispute the extortion charges they try to punish you with.

I use the term 'smart' in quotes because it is a goddamn propaganda term  and needs to be replaced in the popular culture as soon as possible with  something more apt and mocking, say 'evil-genius'. I will use the term  'evil-genius' meters from now on.
Anyways, these evil-genius meters douse your house with something on the  order of 40,000 microwave pulses a day. The meters are built in China, and  allegedly have not had any real safety testing done on them.
The AC-DC converters used to power the evil genius brain in these devices  is supposedly a crap one and generates a significant power waste along  with 'dirty electricity' (that is a choppy or rough sine wave instead of  smooth clean one) which radiates throughout the home via the electrical  The legal principle of 'implied consent' being used to justify the stealth  installation of the meters world wide is a very shaky one. The vast  majority of people that are having these meters installed on their homes  by the power company are complete unaware of what is going on. It's a  classic trojan horse.
It's also a contractual violation. To have a valid contract there must be  an offer, consideration, and acceptance. There is none of this with the  evil-genius meter roll-outs. They simply are putting them in without  asking the customer for permission.
Depending on the jurisdiction, you can refuse the evil-genius meter, but  then you're hit with an extortionate monthly 'meter reading' fee, which  was not charged before the evil-genius meter roll-out began.
Some people in the Los Angeles area that have refused evil-genius meter  installation, have been locked into months long battle with the utility  company and consequently LIVING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY for months on end. Now  that is some crazy shit, now matter how you slice it.
WHY are the companies so adamant about having these devices installed to  the point where they're willing to cut off a resister's power for months  on end, and foregoing that revenue? Perhaps to make an example out of them?
I could go on and on.
If you anybody that sleeps in a room next to one of these devices,  *especially* if they are pregnant women or young children, get them the  fuck away from it as soon as possible, ideally by having the device  removed and replaced with an analog one, or by changing rooms or living

@_subject: Why do people still use Google services? (was Re: Encryption Rights - A Google+ community) 
I've come to the conclusion that almost without exception, people will opt  for convenience over privacy and dignity.
Oh, in other news, Google has snapped up several of the new 'public' gTLDs  (such as .dev) for their own exclusive use, yay Google.
[1]  == Google, Our Patron Saint of the Closed Web  Lately thereâs been a barrage of articles about how Apple is destroying  the open web (because âapp store, lolâ) and it is Time Something Was Done  About This:
     Appleâs paranoid approach to developer relations, and, I assume,  relations with other browser vendors (and, in fact, relations to anything  outside itself) is becoming a serious liability to the open Web. That is  the issue we must confront.
Or here:
     Apple simply does not play well with other vendors when it comes to  standardization. The same sort of things we once criticized Microsoft for  doing long ago, we give Apple a pass on today. Theyâre very content to  play in their own little sandbox all too often.
The answer of course is to petition the Internet Darling Google:
     In order to forcibly educate Apple to become a responsible web  citizen, it is necessary to create a counter-weight; to find a company  that will support the open Web and has enough market share to force even  web developers whoâd prefer to work in iOS only to pay attention to  pointer events. That company is Google.
Why? Who knows. Maybe because Android is âopenâ, whatever the hell that  means. Maybe it is because Google is strongly pro-net-neutrality, and  Apple has made their customary âno commentâ. Maybe because Google  employees have blogs. The world may never know.
Meanwhile, in another part of town, Google has secretly been plotting to  destroy the open internet.
It started innocently enough
Some time around 2008, ICANN determined we didnât have enough domains. So  they decided to open the floodgates on so-called âgeneric TLDsâ or  âgTLDsâ. Stuff like .app, .ceo, .church, and so on.
Of course ICANN cannot actually afford to manage the day-to-day operations  of thousands of new TLDs. So theyâve opened the process up to anyone who  wants to apply. So you fill out an application, you pay $185,000, thereâs  a convoluted evaluation process where they ask you questions like whether  or not youâre a drug dealer and whether youâre technically qualified to  run a TLD, and after a lengthy and bureaucratic review process you  basically get your own TLD.
It came as no surprise that thousands of applicants came forward in some  kind of crazed internet landrush. Many internet companies are placing  bets. Amazon made some 76 applications, and Google made even more, with  What people did not seem to expect (whether due to incompetence or malice  is up for debate) is what they would be used for.
Closed TLDs
Letâs talk about a domain thatâs near and dear to my heart, .dev. Wouldnât  it be great to have a domain for content targeted at software developers?  So that you could actually get a domain name for   Instead abusing the .io domain which is  officially for the British Indian Ocean Territory.
Alas, Google does not think much of that plan. Under their shell company  âCharleston Road Registry Inc.â (whose âCEOâ is merely Googleâs in-house  counsel), they have applied for control of the .dev domain, which they  intend to be:
     completely closed for the sole use of Google.
In case you thought that was a typo, they elaborate:
     Second-level domain names within the proposed gTLD are intended for  registration and use by Google only, and domain names under the new gTLD  will not be available to the general public for purchase, sale, or  registration. As such, Charleston Road Registry intends to apply for an  exemption to the ICANN Registry Operator Code of Conduct as Google is  intended to be the sole registrar and registrant.
In case you believe Google is drunk and they meant to apply for some  other, more Google-specific string, instead of claiming some kind of  monopoly over software development in its entitreity, they helpfully  clarify that no, they know exactly what they are doing:
     The proposed gTLD will provide Google with direct association to the  term Êºdev,Êº which is an abbreviation of the word, Êºdevelopment.Êº The  mission of this gTLD, .dev, is to provide a dedicated domain space in  which Google can enact second-level domains specific to its projects in  development. Specifically, the new gTLD will provide Google with greater  ability to create a custom portal for employees to manage products and  services in development.
I will not bore you with the full application, which is 48 pages and  includes such ridiculous details as how Google will respond to abuse  claims from itself, and how it will handle disputes from itself if Google  files a complaint with Google about Googleâs registration of a domain  name. Nor will I bother you with the other 100 applications for the other  100 TLDs, which are probably similar but I havenât read all of them  because itâs a Friday night and I have plans, so donât shoot me if it  turns out some of them are more evil than others. But itâs all in there,  if you are looking for background material for your next Kafka novel.
Update: Somebody did the math. Google wants 27 of them.
The backlash begins
I know what youâre thinking. âWhat backlash? Iâve never heard about this.â  It turns out that Googleâs behavior has annoyed a lot of domain name  people. But you havenât heard about it because you donât hang out with  scummy fly-by-night domainers who run SEO seminars.
Nonetheless, there is plenty of buzz about this in those circles. (I canât  believe I just gave them a link.)
Governments have also gotten upset too, although you wouldnât know cause  you donât read boring government reports. The Government of Australia, in  particular, has been instrumental in trying to block these proposals.
     in late 2012 the Australian Government issued 129 early warnings to  applicants of strings which raised a number of concerns, including where  the applicant was seeking to have exclusive use of a generic term. ICANNâs  Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) subsequently provided advice to the  ICANN Board at its Beijing meeting in April 2013, which included a  recommendation relating to generic terms, and a non-exhaustive list of  generic terms for the Boardâs immediate consideration.
In response to this controversy, ICANN decided to take a breather and  think about if this whole âclosedâ domain thing was a good idea after all.
Google doubles down
In response to this criticism, Google backed off on what was clearly an  overreach designed to wrest control over the future of the Internet. Haha,  just kidding.
Instead, Google CIO Ben Fried wrote what Iâm pretty sure is the most  brazen, jaw-dropping attack on an open Internet that has ever been  publicly published by the executive of any Internet company. I mean, flip  some words around and it sounds like youâre reading Comcastâs position  against Net Neutrality.
You should read the entire letter, but here are some highlights.
Google opens with a âhow-is-this-not-a-parodyâ argument that owning a TLD  and not allowing anyone else to use it âlead[s] to diversified consumer       Today, most Internet users have only one practical choice when it  comes to how their TLDs are managed: a completely unrestricted model  environment in which any registrant can register any name for any purpose  and use it as they see fit.
Itâs sort of like how North Korea promotes choice because what if some  people want to choose a totalitarian regime.
They then argue that DNS configuration is too hard and so we should just  force all .blog domains to use Google Blogger:
     By contrast, our application for the .blog TLD describes a new way of  automatically linking new second level domains to blogs on our Blogger  platform â this approach eliminates the need for any technical  configuration on the part of the user and thus makes the domain name more  user friendly
That Google should be allowed to close TLDs because nobody will notice       Because of the strong user bias toward domains within .com, today a  generic .com domain name (e.g., jewelry.com or book.com) is likely to  produce more traffic and to be more valuable for a business than a generic  That Google has spent a lot of time and money trying to buy these domains  and if you donât let them bad things will happen
     Applicants have read the guidebook and relied on the policies  contained within to guide their applications. They spent considerable time  and money on their applications in the hopes they would be granted the  applied for string. At best, retroactively deciding to allow a more  restrictive interpretation of the guidebook and at worst going back and  âadding inâ policy runs the risk of appearing capricious and eroding trust  in the process.
Do you know what the consequences of not giving Google what they want will  be? Do you? DO YOU? DO YOU ICANN??
     we must remember that changing the process midstream will have real  and practical consequences for businesses and end users alike.
âClosed generic TLDâ. Who even knows what those words mean anyway? I mean,  youâd have to get a dictionary, or maybe (gasp) google it. Words donât       In reality, neither of the two words have a contextually appropriate  objective definition, and the combined term has no meaning other than what  has been invented in recent discussions about the gTLD program.

That should resolve the âparticular  sensitivity within the Internet communityâ about Google closing the       Google has identified four of our current single registrant  applications that we will revise: .app, .blog, .cloud and .search.
In conclusion
Is my conclusion that Apple should get a free pass for hamstringing their  web evangelists? No. Get your Safari team a blog, Apple. Let them give a  talk at a fucking conference.
My point is that if you think Google is some kind of Patron Saint of the  Open Web, shit son. Tim Cook on his best day could not conceive of a  dastardly plan like this. This is a methodical, coordinated, long-running  and well-planned attack on the open web that comes from the highest levels  of Google leadership. And weâre giving Apple a free pass? Pshaw.
Letâs get serious. These companies are both as good or as bad as we allow  them to be. There is no hero here. In the immortal words of John Adams,
     There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic  into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting  measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is  to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.

@_subject: Re: an ominous comment 
I wasn't there in the beginning so I don't have any firsthand knowledge.
According to this piece, [1] "Almost all cypherpunks were anarchists who  regarded the state as the enemy."
I'm basing the claim on the fact that founding member Timothy May wasn't  exactly shy about his crypto *anarchy* vision of the future.
Not sure what exactly what Eric Hughes or John Gilmore's were at the time.
[1]  The cypherpunks emerged from a meeting of minds in late 1992 in the Bay  Area of San Francisco. Its founders were Eric Hughes, a brilliant Berkeley  mathematician; Timothy C. May, an already wealthy, former chief scientist  at Intel who had retired at the age of thirty-four; and John Gilmore,  another already retired and wealthy computer scientist â once number five  at Sun Microsystems â who had co-founded an organisation to advance the  cause of cyberspace freedom, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. They  created a small group, which met monthly in Gilmoreâs office at a business  he had created, Cygnus. At one of the early meetings of the group, an  editor at Mondo 2000, Jude Milhon, jokingly called them cypherpunks, a  play on cyberpunk, the âhi-tech, low-lifeâ science-fiction genre. The name  stuck. It soon referred to a vibrant emailing list, created shortly after  the first meeting, which had grown to 700 by 1994 and perhaps 2000 by 1997  with by then up to a hundred postings per day. It also referred to a  distinctive sub-culture â eventually there were cypherpunk novels,  Snowcrash, Cryptonomicon, Indecent Communications; a cypherpunk porno  film, Cryptic Seduction; and even a distinctive cypherpunk dress:  broad-brimmed black hats. Most importantly, however, it referred to a  politicalâideological crusade.
At the core of the cypherpunk philosophy was the belief that the great  question of politics in the age of the internet was whether the state  would strangle individual freedom and privacy through its capacity for  electronic surveillance or whether autonomous individuals would eventually  undermine and even destroy the state through their deployment of  electronic weapons newly at hand. Many cypherpunks were optimistic that in  the battle for the future of humankind â between the State and the  Individual â the individual would ultimately triumph. Their optimism was  based on developments in intellectual history and computer software: the  invention in the mid-1970s of public-key cryptography by Whitfield Diffie  and Martin Hellman, and the creation by Phil Zimmerman in the early 1990s  of a program known as PGP, âPretty Good Privacyâ. The seminal historian of  codes, David Kahn, argued that the DiffieâHellman invention represented  the most important development in cryptography since the Renaissance.  Zimmermanâs PGP program democratised their invention and provided  individuals, free of cost, with access to public-key cryptography and thus  the capacity to communicate with others in near-perfect privacy. Although  George Orwellâs Nineteen Eighty-Four was one of the cypherpunksâ  foundational texts, because of the combination of public-key cryptography  and PGP software, they tended to believe that in the coming battle between  Big Brother and Winston Smith, the victor might be Winston Smith.
At the time the cypherpunks formed, the American government strongly  opposed the free circulation of public-key cryptography. It feared that  making it available would strengthen the hands of the espionage agencies  of Americaâs enemies abroad and of terrorists, organised criminals, drug  dealers and pornographers at home. For the cypherpunks, the question of  whether cryptography would be freely available would determine the outcome  of the great battle of the age. Their most important practical task was to  write software that would expand the opportunities for anonymous  communication made possible by public-key cryptography. One of the key  projects of the cypherpunks was âremailersâ, software systems that made it  impossible for governments to trace the passage from sender to receiver of  encrypted email traffic. Another key project was âdigital cashâ, a means  of disguising financial transactions from the state.
Almost all cypherpunks were anarchists who regarded the state as the  enemy. Most but not all were anarchists of the Right, or in American  parlance, libertarians, who supported laissez-faire capitalism. The most  authoritative political voice among the majority libertarian cypherpunks  was Tim May, who, in 1994, composed a vast, truly remarkable document,  âCyphernomiconâ. May called his system crypto-anarchy. He regarded  crypto-anarchy as the most original contribution to political ideology of  contemporary times. May thought the state to be the source of evil in  history. He envisaged the future as an Ayn Rand utopia of autonomous  individuals dealing with each other as they pleased. Before this future  arrived, he advocated tax avoidance, insider trading, money laundering,  markets for information of all kinds, including military secrets, and what  he called assassination markets not only for those who broke contracts or  committed serious crime but also for state officials and the politicians  he called âCongressrodentsâ. He recognised that in his future world only  elites with control over technology would prosper. No doubt âthe clueless  95%â â whom he described as âinner city breedersâ and as âthe  unproductive, the halt and the lameâ â âwould suffer, but that is only  justâ. May acknowledged that many cypherpunks would regard these ideas as  extreme. He also acknowledged that, while the overwhelming majority of  cypherpunks were, like him, anarcho-capitalist libertarians, some were  strait-laced Republicans, left-leaning liberals, Wobblies or even Maoists.  Neither fact concerned him. The cypherpunks formed a house of many rooms.  The only thing they all shared was an understanding of the political  significance of cryptography and the willingness to fight for privacy and  unfettered freedom in cyberspace.

Worldâs First âTruly Anonymousâ Crypto Exchange Launches on I2P
The Grand Opening of a new cryptocurrency exchange, offering anonymous  peer-to-peer trading over the I2P privacy network, was announced yesterday.
Exchanged.I2P will offer its users a way to trade between Bitcoin and a  range of altcoins, without compromising their financial privacy.  Currently, the following altcoins can be traded:
     Anoncoin ANC
     Bitcoin BTC
     Dogecoin DOGE
     Dogecoindark DOGED
     Litecoin LTC
     Peercoin PPC
     Primecoin XMP
     Vertcoin VTC
Additional coins will be added in the near future.
Other exchanges services such as ShapeShift allow their users to exchange  between different cryptocurrencies instantly, without creating an account  or sharing personal information, but they are centralized services with no  direct peer-to-peer trading, and they do not include the extra privacy  protecting measures used by Exchanged.I2P.
Not only will the exchange refrain from asking its traders for the usual  âKYCâ information â your name, address and other personal information â it  also includes a range of other privacy-protecting features. Users can  create accounts and log-in using just a password or PGP key (or both for  2-factor authentication), without even needing to identify themselves with  a username. Of course, the use of the I2P network also means that users  cannot be identified and tracked using their IP address.
I2P is a privacy network, also known as a âdeep webâ or âdarknetâ, which  allows users to create and browse internet services anonymously. It is  used in a very similar way to the more popular TOR network. Some users  claim that it offers improved security compared to TOR, which has been  compromised in the past. TOR has also been the subject of controversy  because a large proportion of its funding which comes from the U.S.  government, and the technology it is built on was original developed by  U.S. naval intelligence. I2P has failed to gain the levels of popularity  achieved by TOR, however, largely because it is more difficult to install  and use.
The Exchanged.I2P project has been backed by the developers of Anoncoin, a  privacy-centric cryptocurrency which is designed for use over I2P and Tor  deep web services, and which has become one of the leading  cryptocurrencies used on I2P dark markets.

This is just code for saying "Iran operates a state owned central bank  instead of one that is controlled by the global banking cartel, thus is  fuels 'instability'"

Speaking of Ellsberg, there's more to the man's backstory than most of you  were probably aware of, listen to this fantastic interview with Douglas  Valentine for the juicy bits. [1]
"Interview 709 â Douglas Valentine on Ellsberg and the CIA
Corbett â¢ 07/17/2013
Today weâre joined once again by author and researcher Douglas Valentine  of DouglasValentine.com to talk about his article âWill the Real Daniel  Ellsberg Please Stand Up?â We discuss his little-known experience as a  Pentagon observer to the CIAâs Revolutionary Development (RD) Program in  South Vietnam from 1965 to 1967, the cast of disreputable CIA officers,  drug runners and murderers that he was involved with there, and the  accusation that the CIA ordered him to release the Pentagon Papers to take  pressure off of investigations that were looking into the role of the  agency in Vietnam at that time. We also explore why the establishment left  refuses to examine this aspect of Ellsbergâs famed whistleblowing story."

That's pretty much par for the course in my experience.
Raising security issues web/network/sysadmins or worse yet developers,  (always in a non confrontational way, to start), the dismissive responses  and outright butt-hurt you typically get is beyond comprehension.
This is the reason I cackle with glee every-time a  company/individual/product/service gets their 'cyber' ass handed to them,  it's the only fucking way people seem to learn these lessons; the hard way.

Yup, more info on U.S. congressional child rapists and other criminal acts  collusion here
Latest update: The U.S. District Judge on this case, a piece of shit fuck  known as 'Thomas M. Durkin' colluded with the prosecution and defense to  keep details of Hastert's crimes sealed via a plea bargain deal.
BTW, Durkin gave to Hastert's campaign and before he became a judge he  worked in private practice with Hastertâs son, Ethan. No conflict of  interested there.
Amazingly, Durkin offered to recuse himself from the case but as you would  expect both the prosecution and the defense said 'no'.
Forget about Jim Bell's Assassination Politics, what we need now more than
ever is "Castration Politics", where Darknet bounties for the genitals of
these sociopathic child rapists and their protectors are raised and then  'harvested' by snatch
'n' snip teams.
