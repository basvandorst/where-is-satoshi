Like many others on this list, I am in deep gratitude for the project's
contributions. I'm a full-time telecommuter and couldn't imagine life
without Freeswan.
However, now I feel like an orphan. Where are users headed to keep up with
evolving requirements, standards, changes, bugs, etc. RoadWarrior support
from NAT'd networks is still an ongoing TODO, among others. I know there's
been talk about IPSEC kernel support in linux v2.6? I'm currently a kernel
v2.4 user in the "if it ain't broken, don't fix it" mode. Is this the
direction most people are going?
Are there any upgrade path documents available? Any suggestions on the best
resource links?
Thanks for any info! FreeS/WAN Users mailing list
