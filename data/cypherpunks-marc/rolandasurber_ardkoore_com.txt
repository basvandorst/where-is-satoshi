A special Swimming tournament that is about to take place. For the
tournament, the participants include a guy without arms, one without legs,
one with just a torso, and... just a head. Starting pistol goes off,
everyone goes forward, but the head sinks right away. After the event,
reporters ask: What did you count on?"Well, see," the head says, "I've spent
seven years in training to use my ears... but those idiots put a swimming
cap on them."
At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including
human beings. Little Tommy, a child in¡¡the kindergarten class, seemed
especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of
Adam's ribs.Later in the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he
were ill, and asked, "Tommy, what's the matter?"Little Tommy responded, "I
have a pain in my side. I think I'm gonna have a wife."
A man goes to church and starts talking to God. He says: "God, what is a
million dollars to you?" and God says: "A penny", then the man says: "God,
what is a million years to you?" and God says: "a second", then the man
says: "God, can I have a penny?" and God says "In a second"
