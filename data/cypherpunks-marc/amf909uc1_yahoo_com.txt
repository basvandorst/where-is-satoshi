@_subject: OFFICIAL BAD BUSINESS REPORT 
OFFICIAL REVIEW BYWWW.GOLDUC.COM
Hi, Im Mike Gregory, webmaster/publisher at  This is my OFFICIAL REVIEW of my website hosting company. i1internet.net receives the following marks:
HONORABLE? - FAILED!     They not only kept my 121$ for a year worth of hosting fees after suddenly revoking their services, but they even refused to release my domain name from their servers! THEN, they
                    began using the home page I worked for months to bring honest prospects to, as a means to slander me and promote their own products!
RELIABLE? - FAILED!     Not only was the tech support staff rude, they also seemed to know very little more than I did!
INTEGRITY? - FAILED!     These people had no regard for the fact that my business is just as real and important as theirs, (only I run an honest business) They took the
                    first chance posable to make ME look bad for their profit!
CUSTOMER SERVICE? - RUDE!     The fork tongued arrogant sissy who seems to be some kind manager there, decided to become a self appointed judge, trial, and jury!
                    Publicly posting his sentence on my businesses front door!

     The internet can make
                    the bussiness world much more accessable to people with disabilities, even someone forced to stay at home can succeed with an internet based business.  I overcame many challanges caused by my disability, and devoloped a
                    solid and honest bussiness after months of very hard work and frustration. E-mail marketing is a very powerfull and effective way to advertize a bussiness, if a person requests marketing info, and gets slowly flooded with
                    marketing offers as a result of submiting their address, is that spam? I was recieving thousands of spams per day because of requesting info or signing up for internet services. I have broke no law, and only sent mail to
                    targeted prospects!      Once i1internet had hung me on my own page, I lost any controle over who could be viewing my new homepage, this is slander. I feel as though this company should recieve the same
                    sentence, and I also want to warn the public about any products or services that are fraudulent or scams, this is my job as a Bussiness opportunity reviewer.      I hope to see you soon at my new website
                    (not up yet) ucgold.org, ucgold is what I ment to signup for anyway, but I got the letters mixed up.
THANKYOU, Mike Gregory
