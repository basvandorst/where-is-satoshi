@_subject: Stealing The Network (novel) free ebook 
If you haven't read it before, someone kindly posted Stealing The Network
series of novels online as a PDF.
"Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box is a unique book in the fiction
department. It combines stories that are false, with technology that is
real. While none of the stories have happened, there is no reason why they
could not. You could argue it provides a road map for criminal hackers, but
I say it does something else; it provides a glimpse into the creative minds
of some of today's best hackers, and even the best hackers will tell you
that the game is a mental one." - from the foreword by Jeff Moss, President
& CEO, BlackHat, Inc.
*Stealing the Network* is a book of science fiction. It's a series of short
stories about characters who gain unauthorized access to equipment and
information, or deny use of those resources to the people who are meant to
have access to them. The characters, though sometimes well described, are
not the stars of these stories. That honor belongs to the tools that the
black-hat hackers use in their attacks, and also to the defensive measures
arrayed against them by the hapless sysadmins who, in this volume, always
lose. Consider this book, with its plentiful detail, the answer to every
pretty but functionally half-baked user interface ever shown in a feature
One can read this book for entertainment, though its writing falls well
short of cyberpunk classics like *Burning Chrome
* and *Snow
Crash *. Its
value is in its explicit references to current technologies--Cisco routers,
OpenSSH, Windows 2000--and specific techniques for hacking them (the heroes
and heroines of this book are always generous with command-history dumps).
The specific detail may open your eyes to weaknesses in your own systems
(or give you some ideas for, ahem, looking around on the network).
Alternately, you can just enjoy the extra realism that the detail adds to
these stories of packetized adventure. *--David Wall*
The stories of the Stealing the Network series entertain in the same way
that "war stories" from fellow hackers and security professionals often
keeps a more intimate audience's interest: by mixing intriguing situations
with juicy technical detail that can serve as a useful take-away. No one
will accuse these books of containing fine literature, but that's not
really the point. The stories are well written enough to keep you wanting
to know what will happen next, while the technical information is as
accurate as you're likely to see in fiction. Segments involving hacking are
written and illustrated with enough attention to detail and length to serve
as introductory educational tutorials for the topics (including web
application hacking, reverse engineering, and wireless security). Most of
these scenarios are believable as parts of larger-scale operations. --McGrew

A week or two ago, a new Snowden was released that shows information about
a visitor to Cryptome. James Atkinson looked at the slide and concluded
that it was proof of a man in the middle (MITM) attack against Cryptome. He
sent his concerns to John and Deborah who then posted them on Cryptome.org
- I'm doing a little bit of research on the slide and decided to compare
notes with what had already been written about it, including Mr. Atkinson's
post. While examining his remarks about the alleged MITM attack, I noticed
that he seemed to be missing a piece of information that led him to a
faulty conclusion. I've copied and pasted the relevant bits below.

@_subject: The GCHQ Cryptome slide could be a mockup/disinfo 
For the latest version:
A few days ago, a new Snowden slide
released that appeared to show that the GCHQ was monitoring Cryptome in
near-real-time by examining the browsing data of one of the websites'
visitors. John and Deborah of Cryptome later verified that the information
in their slides matched their logs, seemingly verifying the legitimacy of
the slide itself and the information presented about KARMA POLICE.
However, after examining the slide and all the information available, I
realized that it was possible to create the slide (or one like it) with
accurate data without any of the sources cited/assumed/alleged. To
demonstrate this, I put together some comparable information. To respect
the privacy of visitors to Cryptome, the end of each IP address is redacted
and I've provided only a little information about several users instead of
focusing on one user to provide detailed information about.
A few notes before getting into the data:
   1. I didn't receive this information from anyone in law enforcement or
   the intelligence, nor stolen through malicious hacking, social engineering,
   or electronic intrusion. Neither is it the result of surveillance directed
   against Cryptome or its users, or of any other illegal action. It was
   compiled from my legitimate archives.
   2. I have confirmed that the information was available to others by
   locating pre-existing sources online.
   3. This is not meant to accuse any one of forging a document, simply
   pointing out that it can't necessarily be verified by confirming the
   information with Cryptome's server logs.
   4. If the slide *is* a mockup, it could be an internal mockup produced
   by GCHQ, a deliberate piece of disinformation from within or without GCHQ,
   a document altered by Snowden, his friends/"friends" in Russia, or anyone
   else in the chain of custody. Given that Snowden didn't review all of the
   documents he handed over, he might not recognize if one had been altered,
   embellished, forged, or taken out of context prior to publication. Or it
   could be genuine - proving that something could be a fake isn't quite the
   same as proving it's a fake.
   5. If the document was forged, the only group I have reason to suspect
   are the chekist security agencies who have access to both the documents and
   to Snowden.
   6. This was the result of a few rushed hours of work in a single
   afternoon, and thus may contain minor mistakes.
   7. The times should be Eastern/US, but this is an unverified assumption.
   8. These comments are unrelated to my debunking
    of
   the MITM attack against Cryptome which was seemingly implied
    by this slide.

Let me begin by saying that Cryptome initially denied the leak, then that
the data was stolen, then that the whole thing was a fake "a lie by [a]
spy-newbie." Look at the data itself and examine the multiple sources, then
decide for yourself.
It's important to note that the logs were not just found in the USBs John
Young/Cryptome sent to me, but in the ones sent to "bandmon", who unless
I'm mistaken is coderman
Original post at
If you haven't read why the alleged GCHQ slide showing spying on
Cryptome.org's users could have been made by anyone, I recommend you do so
before reading this
 In
summary, I showed that the information on the slide could have been mocked
up, depsite matching the logs for Cryptome.org. Cryptome has denied the
accuracy of my data, while oddly accusing me of stealing the data, and
leaves me with no alternatives to posting the data online for others to
review and verify.
The data came from Cryptome itself, on a pair of USBs they mailed to me
 Within those USBs were server
logs that include user IPs (spanning several months), .htaccess files, and
a pwd file. After finding the data in the USB Cryptome had just sent me, I
sent an email attempting to verify it hadn't been included as something
extra that was not for public distrubition:
Double checking that the USBs that you sent were prepared as-is and no
different from any other versions, except updated through August 14 2015.
John Young sent back an accusatory email:
deceived by anything digital or analogue or intergalactic. Especially if
authenticated, signed, sealed, shipped through thickets of traps and
contaminants. You know that, though, and are just being humorously baiting
and entrapping. Like Archive.org and Wikipedia and gosh the whole mess
seething with malevolence.
I replied to John:
Don't mean to bait or entrap, but asking questions with too much context
can be leading. I'm not worried about hidden payloads or anything, I want
to make sure that it was (as far as you know) the vanilla version of the
August 2015 archive and you hadn't purposefully included any extra
information for me to peruse before I posted my findings publicly.
John did not respond.
Since John made a point out of the USBs being generated from scratch every
time, I couldn't be sure how long the data had been available. After some
digging, I found a copy of Cryptome's archive apparently uploaded by
coderman[at]gmail.com AKA bandmon. You can find that torrent here
 I
downloaded the torrent to a remote server, unzipped the files and confirmed
there were log files there as well.
It was my strong preference **not** to post this, but since Cryptome has
refused to validate the data, there is no other way to authenticate it than
to release it to the public along with how to find that information in the
Cryptome USBs/CDs and their various mirrors. It was not my intention to
humiliate Cryptome or expose their users, only to demonstrate that the
slide allegedly proving the GCHQ has spied on Cryptome.org could have come
from anywhere. Despite being accurate, the information is not proof of
surveillance or anything nefarious. In short, the alleged GCHQ could have
been produced by GCHQ as an internal mockup, or forged by anyone with
access to an internet connection.
In addition to the links below, you can also download a complete copy of
the dataset from Cryptome  as well as download a .zip of
all of the leaked logs

If the information is a mockup as Cryptome alleges, then it was created and
distributed by them as part of an insane piece of disinformation designed
to implicate users who are innocent of even visiting Cryptome.org. Far more
likely is that Cryptome has been unaware of these ongoing leaks, refused to
discuss them with me and then attempted to deny their reality.

Before reading this, I recommend reading my first post raising concerns
that the alleged GCHQ Cryptome slide from could be a mockup
followed by my disclosure of Cryptome's leaked user logs
After refusing to comment
denying it, accusing it of being disinfo
accusing me of stealing data
accusing me of being a newbie advertising for a spy job
declaring that it was "a campaign" against them
accusing me of faking data
declaring that all logs leak and they pay for the internet
and deleting my post
 to the

list them to the leak, Cryptome has acknowledged that the leaked logs I found
were legitimate. John Young/Cryptome then thanked me, which is apology
enough for all the accusations.
*You were right about AWStats data. Not the stats for Cryptome itself but
for the Cartome sub-directory, for four months, November 2009-February
2010. Included in a full site restoration by ISP NetSol after a full

archive. Probably best to not expose visitors' data further but then
nothing can be fully deleted or hidden.Thanks for discovering and reporting
in this.Publish this message if you like.Regards,John*
Immediately after receiving his email, I deleted the stat files from my
website. They were only published to force verification and public
disclosure about the leak. Now that it has been acknowledged, there's no
point in continuing to distribute them. If John provides a new
cryptographically signed Cryptome archive file without those logs, I will
replace the one hosted on Archive.org with the new, sanitized version. Note
that .7z may be best to prevent the archive's deriving process (it makes
individual files within the zip viewable) from making changes to the .zip
file which can cause it to no longer match the hash/cryptographic signature.
What does this mean for the slide that seems to show GCHQ spying on
According to John Young's email, the leak is limited to the Cartome
sub-directory which would not include the Eyeball directory. However, the
time frame matches up perfectly and does include the time period the slide
appears to show. Determining whether or not the leak ever included the
Eyeball directory, and why NetSol's glitch only restored those four months
of the Cartome's stats to the Cryptome archive while trying to view a
random selection of the leaked files on the online server failed, requires
more information from NetSol, Cryptome's ISP. Inquiring about those details
from NetSol and disclosing them falls entirely to John Young and Deborah
Natsios. Presumably, John Young would have disclosed if a similar leak had
been found relating to the Eyeball directory, but it remains possible that
the information might have been deleted from the Cryptome archive prior to
 without
John realizing it had already leaked. More information will be required
before those possibilities can be excluded.
As of the time of this posting (13:45 Eastern October 9, 2015), John Young
has not added anything to his website, twitter account, or mailing lists
disclosing the now confirmed leak to his users. He did remove the graphic
advising his users that the GCHQ was/is allegedly monitoring them.

You mean the Cryptome logs? John mailed them to me. And many, many other

But if you wanna pull on that thread, someone could easily do the same to
JYA since he's reposted many pieces of copyrighted material on his site,
without reprint permission or proper copyright notice (which cuts off any

turning that statement into a question was just the logical extension
of what you've exposed as a clearly merciless attack against JYA.

As opposed to his accusations against me, (spy, disinfo, faked data,
stole data, "overstated" his "understated" admission, etc.) all I've
done is present data proving what John did, and only to get the
discussion on the GCHQ slide to move forward.

candidate. Faking a slide like this would be a good way to inspire paranoia

for a week or two, alerting people to the possibility that they'd been
targeted by GCHQ by visiting Cryptome. Sounds like JTRIG-ish paranoia, no?

As I think I said in the other thread, less specific charges that require

it forces the issue to be tried in the court of public opinion, where a lot
of information can't be released lest it spoil an investigation or
potential trial. There's also the fact that there'd be little to gain at
this point by alleging that the slides are fake since there would be few
people to believe it,
"NSA hasn't said it's fake" doesn't seem like a strong argument -
especially for a non-NSA slide. And again - *Snowden himself* has accused

Can anyone poke a hole in my logic for any of the possibilities, or come up

"For the lols" is one such possibility as coderman points out. That motive
could be tacked onto most of the potential fakers, but it does also sound
like something a small group of "anons" might do. Unfortunately that
category is so wide (potentially everyone on Earth) and it's a suspicion
based on a stereotype, so I'm not sure if or how to follow-up with it.

@_date: 2015-10-10 22:46:13
@_author: Michael Best 
@_subject: WHY make a fake GCHQ slide? 
Here's my preliminary list of potential reasons for faking a GCHQ
slide. Not meant to be comprehensive, and not every possibility is
highly likely. Some are included only for completeness, but I'm sure
there are possibilities I missed.
There have been a few incidents already where the slides have been
challenged or at least partially debunked. The German prosecutor found
a lack of evidence that the NSA was illegally monitoring their
government and concluded that the alleged NSA order was a fake.
Snowden has also accused The Independent of attributing slides to him
that he never gave to them.
The why depends on the who. Candidates include:
   - GCHQ
   - Snowden (included for completeness, but least likely. Why fake
this particular slide among many apparently legitimate ones?)
   - Russian chekist agencies
   - Chinese intelligence agencies
   - The Intercept
   - Intel service X
   -
If the GCHQ, then there are a few possible reasons:
   1. Part of a proposal/demo
   2. Disinfo to discourage visitors from going to Cryptome
   3. Disinfo to create paranoia
   4. Disinfo to discredit other slides (Snowden suggests something
like that here    5. Disinfo to convince a FIS (foreign intel service) that their
capabilities are better/more complete than they are (or were better
than they were at the time)
If Snowden:
   1. ???
   2. Makes no sense as an isolated incident, little evidence to the contrary
   3. Would not necessarily recognize a fake slide, since he didn't
examine all of the ones he passed on
If Russian disinfo:
   1. Discredit the GCHQ
   2. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   3. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If Chinese disinfo:
   1. Smear British cyber operations as part of their ongoing cyberwar
with the west and related cognitive warfare
   2. Discredit the GCHQ
   3. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   4. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If The Intercept:
   1. Fame
   2. Money from being paid to publish a fake by any interested party
   3. Financial compensation from media attention as suggested by
If Intel service x:
   1. Any of the above

Thoughts - All good advice in it's own way, but mostly it seems
unnecessary. Aside from copyright and reprint issues, 99% of what's on
Cryptome is not only open source, it's not really objectionable in terms of
hosting it.
TheCthulhu does a great job of distributing large amounts of data, but
that's it's own thing and requires an ongoing budget and infrastructure.
I figure with Archive.org I can distribute 99.9% of material and not worry
about copyright, bandwidth, etc. If it turns out there's a violation I
missed, the item gets taken down - not the entire site or all the uploads.
On the rare occasion that there's something else, I'd rather take whatever
steps are needed to distribute it then rather than try to build my own
independent infrastructure ahead of time.

I personally think that in most cases it's better to make a difference from
inside than outside. There are exceptions and situations where that's
impossible, of course, and sometimes an external shock to the system is
necessary to instigate change... but it's always uncontrolled. I want
people to stick around to fix things, not exit and point out the problems.
That's a very personal choice with a lot of variables though, so I respect
people that come to a different conclusion.
If you do not wish to exit, then make it so others can, easily, simply,
100% agree, with the additional thought that the exit interviews should try
to find a way to 1. solve the problem and 2. hopefully retain the employee.
Or, at the very least, what secrets can you gain from the other side(s)
And now we get into the CI nightmare again. It can be a ripe field for
recruiting, theoretically. At least one study (I think more, but can't be
sure off the top of my head) has shown that for people who were current and
active personnel at the time, ideology played a relatively low motivation
in betrayals and leaks (to the press or foreign agencies). Usually it's
money or revenge, both of which could certainly play a role for people
exiting the service.

@_subject: New Lies For Old / The Perestroika Deception 
If you've never read them or even heard of them, I highly recommend them.
Whether you dismiss him or think there's something worth listening, the
Nosenko / Golitsyn permanently affair changed U.S. intelligence (not to
mention the JFK and Watergate connections).
New Lies For Old: The Perestroika Deception:
In his book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA (Knopf, 1994),
Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in New Lies For Old, 139
had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were
'not soon falsifiable'.
Golitsyn was a figure of significant controversy in the Western
intelligence community. The military writer General Sir John Hackett, and
the former CIA counter-intelligence director James Angleton identified
Golitsyn as "the most valuable defector ever to reach the West". However,
the official historian for MI5, Christopher Andrew, described him as an
"unreliable conspiracy theorist". Andrew believes that although
intelligence data provided by Golitsyn were reliable, some of his global
political assessments of the Soviet and KGB strategy are questionable.
New Lies for Old
In 1984, Golitsyn published the book *New Lies For Old*, wherein he warned
about a long-term deception  strategy
of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into
a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and
diplomatically isolate the United States
. Among other things, Golitsyn
"The "liberalization" would be spectacular and impressive. Formal
pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party's
role: its monopoly would be apparently curtailed. An ostensible separation
of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary might
be introduced. The Supreme Soviet would be given greater apparent power,
and the president of the Soviet Union and the first secretary of the party
might well be separated. The KGB would be "reformed." Dissidents at home
would be amnestied; those in exile abroad would be allowed to return, and
some would take up positions of leadership in government.Sakharov might be
included in some capacity in the government or allowed to teach abroad. The
creative arts and cultural and scientific organizations, such as the
writers' unions and Academy of Sciences, would become apparently more
independent, as would the trade unions. Political clubs would be opened to
nonmembers of the communist party. Leading dissidents might form one or
more alternative political parties.There would be greater freedom for
Soviet citizens to travel. Western and Unitized Nations observers would be
invited to the Soviet Union to witness the reforms in action."
Angleton and Golitsyn reportedly sought the assistance of William F.
Buckley, Jr.  (who
once worked for the CIA) in writing *New Lies for Old*. Buckley refused but
later went on to write a novel about Angleton, *Spytime: The Undoing of
James Jesus Angleton*.
The Perestroika Deception
In 1995 he published a book containing purported memoranda attributed to
Golitsyn entitled *The Perestroika
 Deception* which claimed:
   - "The [Soviet] strategists are concealing the secret coordination that
   exists and will continue between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of
   [the] 'independent' republics."
   - "The power of the KGB remains as great as ever... Talk of cosmetic
   changes in the KGB and its supervision is deliberately publicized to
   support the myth of 'democratization' of the Soviet political system."
   - "Scratch these new, instant Soviet 'democrats,' 'anti-Communists,' and
   'nationalists' who have sprouted out of nowhere, and underneath will be
   found secret Party members or KGB agents."

@_subject: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promotin 
Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest-ranking intelligence official ever
to defect from the Soviet Bloc, served as acting chief of communist
Romania's espionage service and top adviser to President Nicolae Ceausescu.
The highest-ranking Soviet bloc intelligence official ever to defect to the
West, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa is at it again. Today, still living
undercover in the United States, the man credited by the CIA as the only
person in the Western world who single-handedly demolished an entire enemy
espionage service--the one he himself managed--takes aim at an even bigger
target: the exotic, widely misunderstood but still astonishingly
influential realm of the Russian-born "science" of disinformation.Indeed,
within these pages, Pacepa, along with his co-author, historian and law
professor Ronald Rychlak, expose some of the most consequential yet largely
unknown disinformation campaigns of our lifetime.
Discover answers to many crucial questions of the modern era:
   - Why, during the last two generations, has so much of the Western world
   turned against its founding faith, Christianity?
   - Why have radical Islam, jihad and terrorism burst aflame after a long
   period of apparent quiescence?
   - Why is naked Marxism increasingly manifesting in America and its NATO
   allies?
   - What really happened to Russia after the Berlin Wall came down?
Like the solution to a giant jigsaw puzzle lacking one crucial piece,
Disinformation authoritatively provides the missing dimension that makes
the chaos of the modern world finally understandable. By its very nature, a
disinformation campaign can work only if the seemingly independent Western
press accepts intentionally fabricated lies and presents them to the public
as truth. Thus, Pacepa and Rychlak also document how the U.S. "mainstream
media's" enduring sympathy for all things liberal-left has made it
vulnerable to--indeed, the prime carrier of--civilization-transforming
campaigns of lying, defamation and historical revisionism that turn reality
on its head.
   - How destroying the reputation of good leaders has been developed into
   a high art and science.
   - How Pope Pius XII --a generation ago the world's most high-profile
   Christian leader, who personally saved countless Jews from Hitler's
   Holocaust--was transformed, through the magic of disinformation, into a
   Nazi sympathizer.
   - How Christianity and Judaism have been targeted for constant
   denigration and defamation through an ongoing campaign of disinformation.
   - How the Soviet bloc planted 4,000 agents of influence in the Islamic
   world, armed with hundreds of thousands of copies of the most infamous
   anti-Semitic book in history, to fan the flames of ancient Arab resentments
   against the U.S. and Israel and sow the seeds of anti-Semitism that would
   later bloom in the form of violence and terror toward Jews and Christians.
   - How the defamatory attacks on American soldiers John Kerry made before
   Congress upon his return from Vietnam--charges later discredited and
   repudiated--were identical to a contemporaneous KGB disinformation campaign
   concocted to turn Americans against their own leaders.
   - How supposedly respectable institutions like the World Council of
   Churches have long been infiltrated and controlled by Russian intelligence.
   - How much of the world came to believe that the U.S. government itself
   masterminded the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   - How the Soviet Union has been transformed into the first intelligence
   dictatorship in history.
   - How disinformation is still very much alive in the age of Obama,
   remaining a powerful engine in the ongoing socialist transformation of
   America.
All this and much more is meticulously documented in Disinformation, with
the credibility of an eyewitness who was not only there, but actively
involved as a Soviet bloc spy chief--who, thanks to a crisis of conscience,
"left the dark side" and came to America to help shine a light on the
greatest source of political evil of the modern age.

After September 25th, a number of documents from the Litvinenko inquiry
were redacted or removed from the official sites.
Any chance anyone grabbed any of them? I'm grabbing the ones from the
Wayback Machine, but a lot of those files are missing so I'm not sure how
many of the redacted/removed documents were saved this way.

...sucks. At least SocioSpyder  one does.
(I've seen and used better open source and pro but unclassified systems.
Classified ones are probably better.)
"And all of SocioSpyder's functionality can probably be whipped up with a
few elegant Python scripts. "
Enjoy laughing at their software and figuring out how the worthwhile code
would improve on it in terms of functionality and how you would red team
it. (If you want to implement your red team plan then oh no I can't stop
you... ^-^ )

@_subject: The Iran-Contra White House Emails 
Since it's coming up in some of my historical research, and definitely
relevant with all of the HRC email stuff in the news right now, I thought
I'd check and see if anyone here happens to know what agency has custody of
the 3,000 White House emails that were released to the NSArchive after
their lawsuit. About 250 were published by NSArchive, but the rest haven't
been made available yet.
If anyone happens to know what agency has them, let me know. I'd love to
get my hands on them. My initial check with NARA shows only the million
restricted emails held by the GHWBush Presidential Library, but I'll check
with the archivists at NARA II next week.
Let me know if you have any leads!

@_subject: Tacit Futures: Building Snowden Archives (with Cryptome) 
Audio only:
Anyone know of a video source?
Today, WikiLeaks is building an unprecedented library consisting of
millions of leaked documents, thereby advancing a seminal world heritage
form. Its immediate prehistory as well as its latest offspring will be
investigated in the *Tacit Futures* dialogues. Participants will explore
Cryptome.org, which is widely considered the precursor of digital leaking
platforms, and which has been the first organization to start
systematically collecting Snowden documents. Moreover the discussion will
dive into projects building Snowden archives such as the Snowden Document
Search, the Snowden Digital Surveillance Archive, and the Snowden
Archive-in-a-Box. Bringing together pioneering archivists of the files
leaked by Snowden, this round table is a culturally significant world
premiere, aiming to reflect the motivations and challenges experienced by
each initiative.
*Tacit Futures: Diving Into Snowden Archives* is the follow-up to
UN|COMMONS and a cooperation between Berliner Gazette and transmediale in
the context of the Tacit Futures project by Berliner Gazette

@_subject: Re: Publishing CIA's Declassified Vault 
I'm aware of the restrictions, and you misunderstood the plan.
The scanner won't be going to the National Archives. Documents are printed
out from the computers provided by CIA in room 3000 using their laser
printers, then taken from the archive after being checked and placed in one
of the green security bags. (I've done this several times, including today.
It's how I got the Project Truth report and some other goodies.)
The flatbed scanner restriction is for scanning original archive materials
only, since the risk of damaging them is genuinely unacceptable. (The
flatbed restriction is also a bit inaccurate since there are non-flatbed
scanners that are allowed - it's more accurate to say that what's forbidden
are scanners with moving parts that can interact with the paper or

@_subject: The Intercept steps up after catching a reporter faking data and sources 
Short version: One of their reporters was being dishonest, they caught it
and fired them and have retracted one story and corrected several others.
It's nice to see they're trying to be accountable and aren't hiding their
mistakes (AFAIK, they caught it before anyone else did and so weren't just
"getting in front of things" to preempt an outing)
Kudos, Intercept.

I stand corrected - there was an explanation. It was buried in there and it

Sent through MuckRock on December 1, acknowledged on December 2. Also
closed on December 2, according to the DHS FOIA website. No notification or
explanation provided, not through MuckRock or to me directly. I say to me
directly because they also closed another FOIA of mine without explanation,
insisting on opening a new one when I tried to follow up within the 30 days.

If being "gov-friendly" is by itself enough to cast suspicion of bias, then
the same should be assumed of all "gov-unfriendly" outlets.
That's why it's important to look at the data. The source shouldn't be
ignored, but analysis shouldn't begin and end with that.
