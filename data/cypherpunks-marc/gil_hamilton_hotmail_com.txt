If one actually had principles, one would have thought about the

Yes, Tim.  Come on.  Faustine will be doing Important Rigorous and

Congress and the Administration will invite her to come give them
briefings (at least those with sufficient clearance).  Large corporations

She just doesn't want to "show her hand" yet.  You know, all those

I didn't read every word of the documents on the Wired site, but enough
to see that whatever this guy may have been, an actual Mean, Nasty,
Scary Father Raper and Child Pornographer he was not.  As the Church
Lady would say, how *convenient* that the postal inspector has retired
rather than stay on to explain his lies, the manufacturing of evidence,
and the wanton and careless destruction of exculpatory evidence in this
case.  ("I'm sorry, Your Honor, I just can't recall...")
You have to appear to have done some work occasionally, even if you're
a postal inspector.  And then you can't very well admit that you've
just wasted N months and countless tax dollars investigating a poor
nerdy video gamer, can you?  This isn't really difficult to understand
except for the naive, and disingenuous apologists for the police state.
(Don't bother... we already know which you are.)
By the way, when's the last time anyone heard of law enforcement
admitting they made a mistake, humbly apologizing and giving someone
their property back?  I can't ever recall having heard that.  The most
one ever hears is (usually several years after the fact) something
like "mistakes were made; we are re-evaluating our investigative
procedures to avoid any such mistakes in the future".  No one is ever
held responsible.  (Did Richard Jewell get an apology?  Did Wen Ho Lee?
Or Randy Weaver?  How about the Branch Davidians?)
Now, I'm not claiming that the cops are *always* lying.  Only that
anyone who automatically *assumes* that they're telling the truth is
a lot scarier to me than this so-called child pornographer.
This is only the "real issue" for the small percentage of priggish
wannabe cops on the list; those who are afraid that someone somewhere
may be having fun doing something they consider immoral (but who'd
secretly enjoy the titillation of being let in on it).

@_subject: A critique of "RE: Pentagon Readies Efforts to Sway Sentiment 
[re: psyops]
I happened to have a bit of time on my hands, so I decided to spend a
few minutes trying to decipher Aimee's message (rather than simply
deleting them as I usually do).  A few comments follow - more related
to style and usage than content:
Hmm.  "They" presumably refers to "Japan" despite the disagreement in
number.  Still, I don't recall Japan having "walked over France," so
I can't be sure - maybe you mean the Axis powers?.
"Comintern" - now there's a term that must be common in Aimee's Waco
law offices.  Don't you think it's a bit rude to require your readers
to go google an obscure term every other sentence.
And consider the phrase "we had Comintern agents agitating..."  One
wonders whom the pronoun "we" refers to here.
"We [] failed to see the significance, due to American notions of
conflict."  Cause and effect are not obvious.
(BTW, according to Encyclopedia.com, "Comintern" was disbanded in 1943.)
Asian attitudes and the India-Pakistan conflict gave the USSR the "key
to the Middle East?"  This sort of dense non-sequitur seems to be quite
a common artifact in Aimee's rants.
A map "hypothesizing conflict?"  And why would the U.S.S.R. want to
"augment [its] inferiority?"  One would expect that it would be far
more interested in mitigating its inferiority.  And the term "decisive
force in being" is a bit difficult to parse.
There's that "in being" construction again.  Alright, google tells me
that "force in being" is a DOD term of art.  I guess one needs to be
up-to-speed on all the spook-talk around here - no matter how obscure.
"We...relied on communinists...to fight...because Britan was fighting
for survival."  Not sure who "we" refers to.  Having previously
identified herself as being a resident of Texas, the antecedent of "we"
certainly isn't obvious; were she instead known to be from the UK, the
antecedent would have appeared to be the British people.
I'm guessing "we" really means NATO, or western non-communist nations?
(HUMINT: Don't you just love tossing in those spook terms?)
The way I read this "stay-behind resistance", if seeded during the war,
might have prevented invasions.  Wouldn't seeding the resistance during
the war have been a bit late?
In what way are WWII's coasts similar to today's American corporations?
This sentence is quite difficult to parse: Wingate (google again tells
me - hardly a name most on this list should be expected to know off)
was a British officer who advocated behind-the-lines guerilla warfare
(i.e. the "long range penetration").  In what way Britain's (or the
west's) use of infiltration of guerillas would go "along with" anti-
Western agitation certainly isn't obvious.  Nor is the antecedent of
I'm assuming that a "greased invasion" refers to an invasion that is
met with relatively little resistance (at least, google doesn't - at
first glance - indicate that it is another spook-term we should know).
It isn't clear that any country in the world today could execute a
"greased invasion" on another (except for the US, of course, but - from
the context - it appears that we are talking about non-American, anti-
Western invaders).
In what way did Japan in the 40s utilize, represent or pertain to "power
in the peasant" or small power brokers.
All that may be true, but it certainly doesn't seem to follow from the
preceding paragraphs.  It really wasn't until after WWII that "the west"
even began to consider the idea that it had the right to publically
direct other nations how their countries ought to be run.  Certainly that
is doubly true of the US.
All those years of Voice of America and its brethren were just wasted, eh?
Here's the bottom line for me: while occasionally amusing, deciphering
your junk wastes too much time.  It isn't only lawyers whose time is
valuable.  What I believe you were trying to say in this message could
have been said more clearly and more succinctly in one tenth the time,
without the excessive use of obscure terms of spook and DoD art.   I don't
know who you're trying to impress with your prose, but certainly no
one who reads this list is likely to ask you to draw up a contract.
(Unless perhaps the point of the contract is to obscure rather than
illuminate the terms thereof.)

F. Marc de Piolenc forwards:
While it drops off into a bit of jingoism near the end, the first three
quarters of this essay is spot on and expresses well the ideas I've
held about Muslim terrorists for a long time.  Also, it eloquently puts
the lie to the notion that those terrorists attacked the WTC because
they "hate freedom".  It may be true that they hate freedom in some
narrow sense, but it misses the point: what they really hate is the
godless, arrogant, materialistic, undeserved (etc. from the article)
appearance communicated by the exports of our culture.  It is this
hatred of the perception of our culture that is misinterpreted (by
shallow and jingoistic analysts on *our* side) as "they just hate our
Which leads me to a couple of other comments.  The additional security
restrictions imposed on Americans since 9/11 clearly play right into
their hands.  No doubt it's very satisfying to bin Laden that he's put
the infidel Americans to huge additional inconvenience and
substantially decreased their liberties.  (Again, though, it isn't
primarily liberty itself that he hates, but the cultural exports that
flow from the "western" version of it.)
Also, it isn't only the Americans and Israelis that are so regarded -
other western nations are ultimately targets as well -- but the
Americans and Israelis are seen as by far the most egregious examples.
Or, in other words, "we'll bring down Britain, Germany and the rest
after we dispose of the Americans and Israelis."  (Though perhaps France will escape being a target - the French seem to be born with an innate bourgeoisophobia, manifesting itself in such silliness as their
government's continual attempts to prevent their language from being
"corrupted" by English imports.)
Another point well made here is the notion that American left-wing
intellectuals and politicians, as well as right-wing fundamentalists
and their politicians, all fall into this same boat.  The left-wingers
- from Chomskyites to Kennedy/Clinton/Gore liberals - think they need
to protect us from our crass obsession with the pursuit of wealth and
our "selfishness", while the right-wingers - from Falwell and Pat
Robertson to more mainstream Republicans - think we've been consumed
by licentiousness and immorality and that they need to force us to go
back to church.
To those of us who admire all types of liberty, it shows why we need
to keep sticking fingers into the eyes of both sides, or
monkeywrenching, as Tim puts it.
At the same time, none of this justifies many of the arrogant and
inflammatory actions taken by our government which serve as irritants
to the bourgeoisophobes and ultimately give them justification for
their hatred and their retaliation.  For example, why do we give
billions of dollars every year to Israel?  We get little or no benefit
from it, while it antagonizes the hell out of many Arabs.

No privacy is lost in the gmail system; no information about either
party is disclosed to any third party.  The information contained in the
message still remains private to the sender and recipient (well, to the
extent that any web-based mail can be considered "private").  Exactly
what "traditional legal guarantees" do you think would be lost in the
gmail system?
So what?  The average sender doesn't understand that mail is
"intercepted and parsed" by each SMTP or POP server encountered in the
path from sender to recipient.  Or that their message is written to the
hard disk of each of those systems as well.  What the average sender
understands is irrelevant unless there is some bearing on his
expectation of privacy in the message contents.
Really, what's the difference between scanning the message in order to,
say, render HTML tags it may contain, and scanning it in order to
generate targetted advertising based on keywords it contains?  The
latter could also be considered as merely part of the rendering process.

I'm not sure what you find so disturbing about this.  Sure, they're trying to
detect thoughtcrime but they're not going to send you off to a gulag as a
result of this alone (well, at least not in the more enlightened countries);
they will simply "select" you for further screening.  Anything that has the
potential of someday reducing the oppressiveness of the current security
clusterfuck is a plus in my book.
Let them watch and listen all they want.  If we weren't all being stripped and
orifice-searched like felons, we'd have a lot less to be "stressed" about in
the first place.
In the long run, of course, this system too can be defeated.  I'm sure it
works fine to detect a spur-of-the-moment suicide bomber (assuming there is
such a thing) -- or a scared-shitless first-time drug mule -- but a
dedicated-enough terrorist will make enough dry runs and view enough
simulations of likely subliminal pictures that he will not be overly nervous
when the big day arrives.
I'm also very skeptical that the technologies work as well in the field as
their corporate cheerleaders would like you to believe.  Wonder how many
actual terrorists they've tested the system on?  Do you suppose it works as
well as the polygraph?  The same sorts of claims were made when that was
