I call them two individuals. And if they decide to cooperate with each
other, they may be called a team, or whatever.
However the reason we came to this discussion regarding society is that
you claimed that:
So here you claim that society is part of the contract between the author
and the business man. Now if the latter part that society is (n-1) with
respect to the individual holds - then no such agreement cannot possibly
hold, whenever I am not one of the persons in the agreement.
You require society to accept the contract between two people. If - by
your words - society is all the other people (including me), and I will
not accept any restrictions on the form of contracts those people may
have, the society may not restrict contracts (except for those that I
engage in unless there is another person who believes like I do).
Or am I somehow excluded from your definition of society, because I have
_wrong_ opinions?
Or perhaps to you the majority of the society may decide whatever they
want and that is the will of the society? If that is so, then you
shouldn't bitch about any law that is passed in your country, as long as
it is democratically passed.
Take a short look into history and see what kind of things have been done
in the name of the good of the society - it might be enlightening. And to your other email:
Wrong again. A market is something were _individuals_ come together to
trade their posessions and skills to make their own lives better.
Economics studies what happens when these individuals do trade with each
other - and trade we do, in a lot of various ways. It seems that you've bought the propaganda of man as a small piece of
machinery called society.

Logical fallacy number one, there is no such thing as society at large.
There are only individuals. Let me make this very clear; if I do something such as write a book, it is
an action that affects only me and it is done by me. What I wish to do
with that book (the knowledge is contains) is entirely up to me. I don't
want no freaking society to come for crabs, when I create something; and
they have no right to do that either.
If I decide to sell what I created to somebody, that's nobodys business,
but the buyers and mine. If I decide to make terrible conditions to the
contract - well that is also nobodys business but the buyers and mine.
I don't care what the goal of IP is - it is initiated by the government
who has no right to force me to do things on gun point.

If you read my message a little bit more downwards, you would have seen
that I am all for getting rid of IP laws. What I oppose is restrictions on
the contracts that the business man, and the author may do as well as
restrictions on what kinds of contracts the business man (be he same
entity as author, or separate) may offer to customers.
Besides the contract that happens between author and business man today is mutually beneficiary contract in spite of the IP law, not because of it. Of course making the mutual contract 3 party system out of 2 party system,
or into n party system does not make the statement incorrect. The reason
it doesn't work cleanly in case of IPO is because of government (and use
of force) is involved.

This talk about exploitation is purely Marxist dogma that has been
refuted many times. What happens between the business man and the author
is voluntary contract that benefits both.
Who is this public you are talking about? Last time I checked only
individual people existed. There is no hive mind called public that can
think, feel, benefit or be damaged.
I think you are on very dangerous waters here, when you claim that we must
think how to enforce society's development. If I understand correctly, you
are advocating government regulation that orders people to behave in
certain way (in this case eliminating freedom of contract with regards to
circulation of ideas, works, etc). Forget about business models, which do not comply with FREE right to
engage in contracts with other people.
Who would you think is capable of deciding on how to spend that tax money
(which is stolen from innocent individuals)? Do you really think that
more governmental control is good for innovation and new ideas?
Why don't you tell us, what is this wonderful thing you call society? And
what is it's interest? I claim that I am an individual human, and so are all others. Do you
really believe that we can force engineer a group of individuals and say
that it is their good that we are working towards? Nobody but the person
himself is up to deciding what is good for him - thus all force
engineering ends up favoring some on the expense of others.
I agree with you that there should be no copyright laws. But I disagree
with you completely, when you say that we should ban certain kinds of
voluntary contracts between people. Going that way is an endless swamp
that will in the end take away the freedom you claim to like so much.

Nowadays, nowhere. And that is mostly because of copyrights. If there were
no copyright laws, I bet you would have to sign all sort of things to get
tv channels home. And yes, it would be quite a pain in the ass to do this
way 'afterwords' when people already have tv's and expect them to work
without doing anything.

Luckily movie industry will not be hit by the free distribution as bad as
music industry. This is because a major portion of their money comes from
people going to cinema to see the movies. They don't do that because they
don't have a copy at home, but because they wish to see it in a big screen
with awsome sound effects. And that is something we just don't have yet in
every house - and something that will be a big investment for a long time.
And digitilizing will reduce movie makers costs for transferring the
movies to the theaters as well, giving them another edge there. That
allows one to go for a global premiers and gather enough payers in the
first week to pay for the movie.
Now music industry has concentrated in bringing music to peoples homes,
and they will be in trouble when people start getting all their music from
internet for free. There are nice ways of getting around this as well, as
some have pointed around - market will provide...

Now why would they have spy satellites on board still when they are coming
_down_? One might think that if such things were part of the mission
they'd leave them up to spy, rather than bring them back down.

Sure, those are still needed. Though I wouldn't be so sure that toilet and
floor scrubbers will be needed anymore 20 years from now.
This is just bull shit. You don't have to do well in school to do well in
the job market. You just need to have the right kind of skills to do well
in the job market; and if the companies not hiring you are stupid and only
looking at your (school) credentials and not what you know, you can always
put up your own company and succeed that way.
Truly that mentality of school worship, which you talk about, makes me
sick. It's a myth that you need to do well in school in order to make it
out there.
Oh, but it is not a zero sum game. Of course the bottom X% will always be
shit-haulers, sure. But here's the catch. If the bottom X% are people who
could do some complicated work that would earn them $100 000 a year, then
the shit haulers will have to be paid more than that amount a year. Or no
one will apply for those shitty jobs. The basics of economics: If there's
a shortage of something, markets tend to rise up the value until the
demand and supply meet. Exactly same does go for unregulated job market.
Hell yeah. Public school system should be abolished right now. Hmm, I'm
not quite as fanatical on these things as Tim is (who probably would want
to shoot all those teachers and administrators), but I do find public
schools to be something quite horrible.
No, no, no. Public schools don't educate. Their purpose is to teach
obedience and understanding that a single person cannot do without the
government. Thus the nooks in Washington can get to keep their power.
You really think there is this big conspiracy that covers all the
companies working in the US, which keeps these black lists and exists just
to screw those who don't like the system?
How about just saying that if one is lazy and does not do his work well,
he might be screwed - and that is frankly a problem of his own making. You
take up on a contract, you keep it.
Nonetheless, I think we do such people a great disservice if we do not
show that their culture has a very bad bias against learning and
understanding. Such a bias, if it exists, should not be hidden, or shunted
upon; it should be brought to broad day light and shown in all its
