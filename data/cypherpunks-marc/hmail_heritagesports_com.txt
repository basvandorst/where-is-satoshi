Danny Report
Dear Sports Fan:
Were proud to report that renowned sports analyst               Danny Sheridan has named Heritage Sports as               the  offshore sports book in the world. Danny cited our excellent               customer service, creative propositions, and straight-ahead commitment               to providing our clients with the best product at the               best value. To celebrate, were sending you Danny Sheridans               Special Report on the Offshore Sports Industry. You               can read more about us and other elite offshore sports books for               2001 in this exclusive, free report. Then take a few moments to open or reactive your Heritage               account. Just call one of our friendly Customer Service Representatives               at 800-800-7777. Youll be on your way to some serious action. Your friends at Heritage World Wide Sports
With offshore sports gaming now               a multi-billion dollar industry, it can be difficult for the consumer               to separate the reputable sports book from the less so, the exceptional               from the merely average. My staff and I, with the help of other               industry pros, have investigated many of the present offshore operations.               Those that met or surpassed our standards for 2001 are included               in this report.
Our analysis has shown that these               offshore sports books are honorable and financially strong, but               we welcome your experiences. Send your comments, positive or negative,               to Sheridan Specials, Inc., P.O. Box 2122, Mobile, AL 36652, 1-251-476-1122.
Heritage Sports  800               800 7777                An industry pioneer, Heritage was one of the first sports books               to open offshore. They brought a passion to build the most well-run,               customer service-focused company in the business  and theyve               done it. Theyre one of the most creative sports books Ive               ever seen when it comes to developing new promotions, such as special               wagers and enhanced parlay odds during their weekday Madness               Hours,  almost parlays, and if bets               when youre out of available credit. Even in the strong field               listed here, Heritages consistent dedication to providing               the best product at the best value has impressed me enough to select               them as my pick as the best of the best for 2001 and the  sports               book in the world. Tradewinds  800 387 9358                              A very low-key sports book, with one huge, differentiating factor               that didnt slip our investigation. They take the biggest bets               Ive heard of and, most important, they pay. This no-nonsense               shop takes bets ranging from $10 to whatever you arrange over the               phone. I havent heard of a maximum refused yet. The underground               stories told of bets paid off by Tradewinds are impressive. You               can feel comfortable including this operation in your list of outs.
Olympic  888 Fast Bet               (327 8238)                No one beats the Greek in putting up the first line in the world               many days  and I mean on about every game and proposition               you can think of. The Greek is a gambler and if youre               one too, then Olympic will probably give you more opportunities               than youre going to find just about anywhere to gamble it               up. This is a solid shop, run by a man who is one class act with               a lot of heart.
ABC Sports  800 260 3415                ABC Sports opened in the Caribbean several years ago, in what I               call the second wave of sports books to select an offshore haven               - a move that didnt seem to slow them down in becoming a top               sports book. They are well-managed, motivated (especially this year,               with the return of their old manager) and take care of business               in a quick, efficient manner. Their claim to fame: They offer clients               the worlds absolute best teaser prices.
Royal Sports  800 644               3846                Royal Sports moved to the Caribbean in the second wave,               like ABC Sports. While these two sports books were obviously the               cream of their class, they offer very different styles. Royal is               a much more laid-back book , but dont let that fool you. Every               member of Royals management Ive met takes a tremendous               pride in the consistent level of quality service their clients receive               day in and day out. I dont believe theres a sports book               out there that gets you your money any faster, making them another               in a handful of world-class sports books.
WIT Sports  800 416-4031                              A slew of new sports books opened their doors last year. There arent               many left. So I cant help but acknowledge the accomplishments               of first-year sports book WIT as my Rookie of the Year.               WIT stands for Whatever It Takes (to please a customer)               and they put their money where their mouth is. Like Olympic, WIT               puts out a lot of propositions and they put them out early. That               confidence is pretty impressive for a couple of new kids on the               block. WIT is a solid sports book  at their current pace it               shouldnt be long before they could join the elite list of               top sports books.
