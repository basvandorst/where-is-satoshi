U.S. GOVERNMENT WELFARE FOR OIL INDUSTRY
$114.6 BILLION ANNUALLY
The U.S. federal government provides up to US$ 114.6 billion
in subsidies annually to support the extraction, production
use of petroleum, such as research and development and
financing. The federal government also spends up to $1.6
yearly on regulatory oversight, pollution cleanup and
costs connected to the oil industry, the group said. In
U.S. Defense Department spending allocated to safeguard
world's petroleum resources totals $55 billion to $96
billion a=20
year, according to the International Centre for
Assessment. Tax subsidies don't end at the federal level, as
group said most state income taxes are based on oil firms'
federal tax bills, which result in companies paying US $123
to $323 million less in state taxes.=A0 (C) Reuters Limited
The renewable energy and energy conservation industry
sectors are
concerned that the subsidies distort the free market and
make renewables
less economically competitive. They are calling for a
levelling of the
economic playing field. Either the renewable and
industries are given the same subsidies. Or, the subsidies
withdrawn from the oil industry. It is time, they say, for
free enterprise. It will be good for the economy, they say,
and it
will result in cheap and substantial reduction in greenhouse

Global atomic agency confesses little can be done to
safeguard nuclear plants
Wednesday, September 19, 2001
By William J. Kole, Associated Press
VIENNA, Austria - Security is being tightened at the world's
nuclear power plants, an international watchdog agency said Monday,
but it conceded that little can be done to shield a nuclear
facility from a direct hit by an airliner.
Most nuclear power plants were built during the 1960s and
1970s, and like the World Trade Center, they were designed to withstand
only accidental impacts from the smaller aircraft widely used at
the time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said as it
opened its annual conference. "If you postulate the risk of a jumbo jet
full of fuel, it is clear that their design was not conceived to
withstand such an impact," spokesman David Kyd said.
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham was among delegates
from 132 nations who opened the conference with calls to better
safeguard nuclear plants and to keep nuclear materials out of
terrorists' hands.
Abraham brought a message from President George W. Bush to
the Vienna-based IAEA, urging the agency to keep pace with "the
real and growing threat of nuclear proliferation." The world "must
ensure that nuclear materials are never used as weapons of terror,"
Abraham said. "We cannot assume that tomorrow's terrorist acts will mirror
those we've just experienced."
In the wake of last week's attacks in New York and
Washington, governments have tightened security outside nuclear power
and radioactive waste facilities worldwide.
But Japan, which is heavily dependent on nuclear energy and
has 52 nuclear plants, warned Monday that although tighter security
is needed, nothing can shield the plants from attacks by
missiles or Conference delegates, who began Monday with a minute of
silence and a song from the Vienna Boy's Choir in memory of the victims of
the U.S. attacks, met behind closed doors Monday and Tuesday on ways
to improve plant security.
In the West, nuclear power plants were designed more with
ground vehicle attacks in mind, Kyd said. Although many were
designed to withstand a glancing blow from a small commercial jetliner,
a direct hit at high speed by a modern jumbo jet "could create a
Chernobyl situation," said an American official who declined to be
identified. However, the buildings that house nuclear reactors
themselves are far smaller targets than the Pentagon posed, and it would be
extremely difficult for a terrorist to mount a direct hit at an angle
that could unleash a catastrophic chain of events, Kyd said.
If a nuclear power plant were hit by an airliner, the
reactor would not explode, but such a strike could destroy the plant's
cooling systems. That could cause the nuclear fuel rods to overheat
and produce a steam explosion that could release lethal
radioactivity into the atmosphere.
The IAEA said it would work more closely with Interpol and
other police agencies to minimize the risk of nuclear materials
falling into terrorists' hands. Over the past 12 months, there have
been 13 known interceptions of trafficked nuclear material
worldwide, the agency said.
Officials said it takes at least eight kilograms (17 1/2
pounds) of plutonium or 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of enriched uranium to
produce a single nuclear weapon, but that only miniscule amounts of
those metals are known to have been smuggled in recent years.
"A nuclear weapon requires tremendous expertise. We have no indications that any terrorist group is that advanced," Kyd said.
Although nuclear waste potentially could be used to produce
a "radiological" weapon, it would take months or years to
kill, and it is far cheaper to obtain compounds that could be used to
create lethal chemical weapons, he said.

I've been training dogs for at least 35 years (not counting when I was a kid)
and it's pretty easy to have a dog that is both a good house pet, wonderful with
kids, and totally alert, totally on guard at all times. Depends what you start
with. I suggest Airedales as being willing to fight bears and lions (they are
used for that regualarly) and also being great family dogs, albeit needing a
_very_ firm hand and _lots_ of exercise. Best have two, then they wear each other
out, and provide twice as much security. Pair them with a mellow dog like a Lab
and they will drive it crazy.
      My cats ( all 5) love dogs. My dogs love cats.
     They never really sleep, and don't quit when the power goes out.
      Mine love my dogs - some (actually most) of my cats are feral cats who
first made friends with my dogs, then slowly allowed me to approach.
    What can I say? Except I can't imagine life without a dog. Or two, or
preferably 5 or so.
      hmm. well, why don't they go along? or why not cultivate a trusted someone
who can feed the dogs?
     Hardly.
     Hardly. Here, you get a $300 fine for feeding outside cats, $165 for
allowing a cat to roam.
     Well, that's the first thing you've said in this vein I agree with.
Cats (and dogs) know one fuck of a lot more about you then you know about them.
Speak kindly to them. We keep a bin feeder on the porch for cats, just like we
keep a bird feeder in the back yard. Don't betray them.
    Oh, and btw -- cats can also be great watchcats. I have a cat who absolutely
freaks when strangers come -- hides away where I can't even find him. If I come
home and he's in hiding, then I know.

No, it wasn't debunked at all -- no evidence was given, only

cost, oil has an absurd price, and that cost is rapidly going thru the roof.
     Biodiesel is a much better alternative than ethanol, but each has it's
place. All farming is subsidized at this point, biofuels have the potential
to make farming profitable again. Besides, as long as the oil industry has
even greater corporate welfae payments, why not? Speaking of program

not mechanized enough, or not big enough. So why are they losing their land and
moving to the city to become wageslaves for some megacorp?
      In the US, it's been the swindle worked on them by the chem salesmen, the
gov't, and the banks -- non of which the Amish have any truck with, so they do
okay. In Latin America we see them primarily being kicked off their land by
"paramilitarys" usually in the pay of big ranchers and/or megacorp argribiz,
and sometimes by the army. Maybe kicked off is too strong -- frightened off by
all the rapes and murders and beatings, or, with the army, "relocated" to make
them "safe" from the guerillas (and to stop them from feeding the guerillas).
Remember -- we participated in this in Viet Nam? Our troops moved the peasants
off becuase it was "Viet Cong" territory, into camps where they could be
controlled -- and incidently provide cheap labor for some industry or other.
    Often, when the peasant tries to return to his land, he finds that the
local courthouse has been burned and all the records of ownership lost. In Viet
Nam, I personally know troops who killed villagers when they returned from
relocation camps. Not the first time, not the second time, but the third time

Of course you're ignoring the fact that sometimes the reason that they
are "starving on their own retched little plots of land." is because of NAFTA
and huge multinational corporations importing so much US factory farmed corn
and other ag products into that country that they can't compete. We've been
thru this discussion before.
      All else being equal, there is no logical reason in the world why they
should be "starving on their own retched little plots of land." Peasant farmers
have been making an adequate living on "their own retched little plots of
land." for at least since before any recorded history, and, for that matter,
can still do so.
      The average size farm in the world is only 7 acres, and if you talk to
most of those farmers, they would much rather live and work on their little
subsistence farms than move into a city and work in a factory. I myself lived
for many years on a very small farm and most definitely, as soon as humanly
possible, am going back to doing just that. Moving from your own piece of land
in the country being you own boss to living in a hovel in the city working as a
wageslave in a sweatshop for peanuts is not an improvement by any stretch of
the imagination.
      Anyone who spends any time at all researching the conditions of peasant
farmers in the 3rd world who leave their land and go to work in sweatshops
would never come to the conclusion that they chose to do so.

Their point is be disconnected from any central control, for one thing.
It's independance, not a total rejection of modern ways. They'll ride in cars,
for instance, just not, for the most part, own them.
      And my main point was that they do very well financially, where most other
small family farms are going under.
       Well, what's wrong with that? If you have a phone line in your house, it
makes it easy to bug you, doesn't it. I lived without a phone for about 18
years, it's not difficult. At one point, in fact, the phone company, without
asking, ran a buried phone line to the quite rural house we lived in, knocked on
the door and asked if they could install a phone inside. I said no, and, as soon
as they left, dug up the phone line in a dozen places along the route, cutting
chunks out of it.

The best example I can give is the Amish. They *don't* send their sons to ag

extension agents, and make money with small, totally old fashioned, organic farms. No
tractors, horses to plow with -- and make enough that when each son gets married, they
buy him a farm with cash.
They don't do the factory farm trip, don't get look for gov't handouts (which is what

What? You're talking nonsense here. Of course they make part of their living
selling crops --- what's all the bs about "forging his own metals" etc. Total straw
man arguement. The point was that they aren't "starving" for one thing, and, if it
were up to them, they'd stay put.
      Look, I'll try to explain it in terms that perhaps even a city boy like you
can understand. You don't have to go to the 3rd world, just go talk to small
american family farmers. There are thousands of them out there who simply don't care
that they aren't making lots of money -- the important thing is that they can keep
their farms and do their own thing. What's wrong with that?
      You know what destroyed the small family farm in this country? Education -- ag
schools and the county extension agent. Funded, for the most part, by large chemical
companies. The old story of the country bumpkin getting conned by the city-slicker
salesman. Kids went off to ag school, came home and told Dad to do things the
"modern" way, factory farming with modern chemicals -- sure, go into debt, buy all
those new tractors and fancy equipment and we'll be rich.
      And then, of course, that little trick the Fed Reserve and the banks pulled
back in the 70's with manipulating the economy so that rural land prices went thru
the roof, farmers who had been mortgage free for generations got duped into
borrowing money on their land to buy that fancy new equipment that the ag schools
and extension agents told them they needed, then bingo -- the Fed played some more
tricks, land values dropped back down, and a whole lot of farmers lost their land.
       Is that what you call free-market economics? I call it fascism -- state and
industry working in concert to whipsaw the masses and get more control over peoples
lives. People who were very free and independant are suddenly wage slaves in the
city because they listened to the "experts" from industry and government. And got
      I know one heck of a lot of people who much prefer living in rural "poverty"
to living in a city making big bucks. Although my wife and I have been making a
whole lot more money in recent years than we ever thought we would, and live in a
big fancy house in the city, we consider it a serious mistake. Money isn't
everything. We were one heck of a lot happier when we earned about $4000.00 a year.
We will soon rectify that. Why make a bunch money and feed the fascist machine?
     One of my favorite cartoons was one of Snuffy Smith and his wife --- she says
"Pa, the world is passing us by." Snuffy replies, "It sure better!"
Damn straight!

       Biodiesel is being sold in the US as we speak for anywhere from $.99

vegetable oil. Given the economies of scale working here, once they build
up a larger presence, those prices will drop. And, if I'm not mistaken,
much of Europe is already mandating that all diesel be sold with at least
20% biodiesel.

VW presents new synthetic fuel strategy
In the context of its fuel strategy released at the recent Frankfurt IAA Motor Show, Volkswagen sees SunFuel as a key step towards environmentally compatible mobility. The new fuel offers considerable potential for the optimisation of conventional engines. SunFuel is also suitable for use in fuel cell systems with reformers.
On this basis, it will be possible to fill up fuel cell vehicles with a fuel produced from renewable resources without developing costly new infrastructure of the type which would be needed for hydrogen SunFuel is a synthetic fuel produced from biomass by a regenerative process. Natural photosynthesis is used for fuel production. Plants develop biomass from atmospheric carbon dioxide with the aid of energy from the sun.
To a large extent, this biomass consists of carbon and hydrogen. In the first step of the SunFuel process, these major constituents of biomass are converted into synthesis gas (H2, CO, CO2). This is then transformed into hydrocarbons in a synthesis reactor and processed as required to produce the "designer" fuel.
SunFuel is an extremely high-grade fuel, free from sulphur and aromatics. As biomass binds carbon dioxide during growth, the process is neutral with regard to carbon dioxide production. A variety of different types of biomass can be used for the synthesis of the new On the one hand, fast-growing, sturdy, resilient plants such as sedge (Miscanthus), poplars or willows can be grown. On the other hand, waste products containing carbon and hydrogen, such as sewage sludge, plastics or household refuse, can also be processed.
SunFuel must not be confused with Biodiesel. While only rapeseed oil is used for Biodiesel production, the SunFuel process taps the energy contained in the entire plant.
The use of SunFuel is highly environmentally compatible. In contrast to fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas, no additional carbon dioxide is produced during the combustion of SunFuel. As it is free from sulphur and aromatics, the new fuel also ensures a significant reduction in all types of emissions normally measured, especially particulate matter.
According to Dr Ulrich Eichhorn, Head of Volkswagen Research, "SunFuel opens up additional new perspectives. To date, engine developers have been forced to work with the fuel qualities available. Now, synthetic fuels of a variety of types can be produced.
"Not only petrol or diesel fuels can be synthesized from biomass. A number of intermediate stages are also possible. On this basis, there could be further rapprochement between petrol and diesel technology. In this way, the benefits of a diesel engine, such as low consumption, could be further expanded and combined with the very low emissions of a petrol engine with three-way catalytic converter.
"The designer fuel can be mixed with conventional petrol or diesel without any problems. SunFuel could therefore be introduced in a gradual transition process.
"In order to produce SunFuel for all the diesel-engined vehicles in Germany, it would be necessary to plant about 20 000 square kilometres. Currently, this area is certainly not available. However, the area of agricultural set-aside, about 10 000 square kilometres, could be used for growing energy plants for fuel production.
"The production of synthetic fuels from natural gas is a state-of-the-art technology. The properties of the fuel do not change. However, this type of synthetic fuel can result in a carbon dioxide saving if associated gas (for instance, the gas produced together with oil, which is normally flared) is used."
Volkswagen sees hydrogen as a possible fuel of the future. However, it will be best to combine hydrogen with fuel cell technology.
According to Dr Eichhorn, "There are still at lest three technological barriers to overcome: the regenerative production, storage and distribution of hydrogen. Volkswagen therefore believes that hydrogen technology will not be used before 2015."
Hydrogen will only result in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions if it is produced from renewable sources. However, carbon dioxide reduction with regenerative energy production is not only possible if elementary hydrogen is used as a fuel. SunFuel can be stored and distributed using existing infrastructure and is less costly to produce than hydrogen. This is why Volkswagen sees SunFuel as a promising fuel for the future.

On a long road trip one night, I heard an extremely interesting long
discussion amongst a group of psychiatrists, sociologists, and other
scientists,  regarding a study which showed, firstly, that large numbers of
attractive young women married unattractive, frequently older, boring, but
financially well-off men.
      No surprise, that, eh? But then, the study showed, that a large
percentage of these same women also tended to have adulterous relationships
with what was termed "dangerous" men -- losers, outlaws, reckless adventurers,
     Another surprise was that this was a cross-cultural phenomenon, and the
gist of the discussion was that this wasn't merely thrill seeking or whatever
on the part of the women, but was actually subconscious darwinism in action,
i.e., the woman formed the permanent alliance with the man who could best
support her offspring, then got herself impregnated by the males with the
strongest, sexiest, genetic makeup -- thereby insuring that not only would her
children survive, but they, like their true father (and also like the mother)
would be very attractive and likely to mate.
      An extremely interesting idea. Some might find the articles in the most
recent Wired about the high percentages of autism among Silicon Valley
children to be interesting --

Kinko's got sued over selling the "student packets", there was a
big flap over it a few years ago in academia, but as I recall the end
result was that professors are more careful to have written permission
from the publishers in hand, and the packets are still being sold.
    Most publishers are cooperating -- it's simply that the material is
in the library, the portions of the books used is not large enough that
students would buy them anyway -- as opposed to actual "textbooks" that
they do purchase, so it seems a reasonable "fair use" compromise. In
most of these cases the publishers realizer that they aren't going to
sell more books by refusing, the authors realize that they'll get more
exposure, more recognition, and the students don't have to spend hours
in the library waiting for someone else to finish copying the materials.
    But as I said, most professors are being much more careful about
getting permission beforehand and most copy places are being more
careful about what they sell.
   At the biomedical library I worked at, the copiers only worked if you
had a special card, and only students and faculty had the cards, since
copying the medical texts and selling them to law firms and clinics
was/is a lucrative business and was a principal income for the library.
Don't know how the DMCA has affected them.

Actually, I think it's a non-issue. Why would someone planning a bombing,
let's say, check out a book from the library on explosives, when he could just
read/copy it right there, totally anonymously. Of course, in the past when the
fedzis wanted access to patron's records, it was more on the level of thought
crime -- were they reading commie lit. Is that what they're after now -- whose
reading Islamic texts? Put them on the list to be tortured.    Also I just realized that if they allowed the fedzis access to the staff side
of the database, so they could read the victim's records, they would then also
have the ability to manufacture evidence, check out books in that person's name.    Exactly. And most ISPs don't have the moral backbone that librarians do, they
all roll over without a wimper. I think the fedzis would have to be seriously
stupid in the first place to even attempt to get libraries to spy on patrons --
there's far too many old '60s radicals in libraries who would love the
opportunity to shout it from the rooftops, make a real cause out of it. It's
totally absurd for the fedzis to think that they can tell anyone not to talk

muster. Are they going to start arresting citizens as "material

You'd probably be surprised then, because I'd bet it has been
computerized. In WI and MN at least, even the tiniest libraries are on line. It
came about because of laws mandating that all public libraries belong to a
library consortium, and the consortiums run the centralized databases. If they
don't join the consortium, they can't get state funding, and since most
libraries are strapped for cash, they join. And the computer revolution has been
going on in libraries for a decade now -- I can recall libraries where the staff
was terrified of computers, but most of those people either got on board or
retired. I'm sure there are non-computerized libraries in backwards states like
AL or MS, where they don't even fund the public schools, let alone libraries,
but NJ? Hardly.
   It's a matter of policy not to keep records, that, and the fact that library
software comes with that turned off by default. In some cases I think it would
take custom programming to turn it on. And in most cases, since most systems
librarians are not really computer gurus and rely heavily on outside
consultants, they would have to call the software manufacturer or an outside
consultant to help them figure out how to turn on the retention of patron
records after the books is checked back in. And then explain to them *why* they
would want to do such a nasty thing. And, as I said, there would be immediate
outrage on the part of the other librarians with much shouting and wailing and
demands for explanations, and demands that it be turned off.
   I think most people don't realize what strong civil libertarians most
librarians are -- and how much privacy and freedom of speech is stressed in
library administration and library schools.

A library director of a library that kept that sort of info would be destroying his own career if he expected to go anywhere else. And I think cooperating with the feebs would do likewise.
    Nobody really believes the gov't anymore -- Asscruft would be spat upon if he entered most libraries. I think at this point most educated people recognize the Un-Patriot act for what it is - the USA Fascist Manifesto.

There would very quickly be a court challenge, just as there was a court

to everything else like this -- the filtering acts, etc.
   How would they serve this order? If they came to me as the sysadmin, I'd have
to talk to my boss, the director about and also to an attorney, before I did
anything for them. And if I changed the settings on the database to keep all
records, everbody in the library would know about it very quickly, and there
would be a some real pissed off people demanding to know why I had done
it. Furthermore, most libraries these days have joint databases with a bunch of
libraries in the area, and they would notice the change and would be jumping up
and down, demanding public meetings, etc.    So the only way they could have it done is to approach someone to have them
look at the system day by day and write down what the victim of the warrant was
checking out. And what if he didn't check it out, just read it in the
library? So much for that data, there'd be none. Or would the Feebs just have
one of their own come into the library each day and access the staff side of the
software -- people would certainly notice that too. People would talk, believe
me. You can't get people to do something that pisses them off and expect them to
really cooperate.    I'd be willing to bet that in most libraries if they didn't file a court

As a sysadmin in various libraries, I can attest to the fact that most library
software is set to drop the record of what anyone has checked out as soon as the

concept of anyone knowing what other people are reading, know also of one case
of a library clerk being fired when it was discovered that they were spying on
the reading habits of other librarians. And when the FBI tried back in the 50's
and 60's to access library records they were almost universally stonewalled.    While I realize it would be possible to reset the software to keep the
records longer, if it were indeed happening, everyone working in that library
would be aware of it, and people would be talking. I don't know of any way it
would be possible to make the software keep track of just one person, it would
have to keep the records for everyone. Of course, someone could keep track
manually, but I'd be willing to bet that if this were happening at all, the ALS
would know about it and would be filing suit against the DOJ.

better IC engine for hybrids. Even in non-hybrids, VW builds some pretty nice
diesel cars, including the Lupo, on the market for a couple years now, which
gets 80mpg. And the prototype that VW's CEO drives around in that gets 280mpg.

No, Tim is right. The Mormons might consider themselves to be "christian",
but are not recognized as such by any other denomination. In fact, they are
billed as a "dangerous cult" just like the Moonies, etc. by most christians.    If you really take a close look at Mormon, you'll also note that Lucifer is
considered the brother of Jesus and of equal, or even more important standing.
   And even more interesting are their rites for initiation into the Temple
(most Mormons never go thru this, only the elect) where the member, both male
and female, is completely disrobed, their body washed (every square inch) by
other people, then anointed, again, every inch, and painted with occultic
symbols, and they are then dressed in a sacred undergarment which they must wear
the rest of their lives. Even when bathing, at least one arm or leg has to stay
in the sacred underwear. They swear alligence to Lucifer during the ceremony,
among other things.    Tim is also right about the similarities to Islam. Joseph Smith was a con
artist who went to prison for scamming people with his "peep stone" which he put
in his hat, stuck his face into the hat, and was then able to read instructions
from the stone. Originally he was using it to "find" buried treasure, and this
scam got him busted, later he used the same "peep stone" trick to "find" the
"sacred writings", etc. Like Muhammed, he soon realized the necessity to have
mulitiple wives. He also, and some of the leaders after him, got the holy word
from god that told them that all the worldy goods of their non-mormon neighbors
belonged to them, and they went out raiding farms and towns, which got them run
out of New England, then run out of IL. which is how they ended up in Utah.    Bizarre group. Read their history -- fascinating stuff. So is the history of
Islam. A poor man, Muhammed married a rich widow old enough to be his mother,
got visited by angels, started Islam, decided men needed multiple wives, etc.

     As many of you know I am in Iraq with the 724th

enlistment contract ended and the I have been involuntarily extended.  I
am now a prisoner of the US army.  I find it very troubling that the USA
would force people against their free will to be in
the military, furthermore the fact that their are
hundreds perhaps thousands of able bodied volunteer
soldier in the Wisconsin Army System that have not
been activated and that could replace those soldiers
who are in Iraq involuntarily.  I request you
assistance in helping me get home.  Free Moon!!
Below is a letter I have written to our Wisconsin

addresses and email addresses.  I ask that you read my letter to them and
email or write all of them with a similar letter addressed from your view
point.  Please do not forward my letter to them but rather write them in
you own words your objection to the practice ofinvoluntary extension as it
pertains to me.  I feel that if enough people write that it may actually
influence my Battalion Commander, who has the power to do so, to grant me
my honorable discharge and send me home.  Also please forward this email
to people who you know know me and would be willing to help.  Please help

Yes, I'm well aware of what it's trying to say, but it's really a very poor
analogy based on a faulty premise.    Not "may" -- they always do, just as dogs do. And not just in first meetings,
it continues virtually forever, including sometimes all-out fighting, but
sometimes too subtle for most humans to even be aware of.     We have three or four distinct groups of cats living here that we feed. Two
in the house, two in the garage/greenhouse who once lived in the house but could
not resolve the dominance issue between one male in the house and one alpha
female now in the greenhouse. Then there are the more or less permanent two
females that live on and under the front porch, who also have serious unresolved
issues with the Mama Fritz of the greenhouse (who does get outside during the
day). Dominance also goes down the line, watching the 3 young offspring of one
of the porch ladies makes that pretty clear, one of those bosses the other two,
but all are subservient to the two older females, and their mother, Shy, clearly
bosses Bobbette, the other older female. Neither of them take crap from Mama
Fritzi, in fact one day I watched Bobbette whup Mama's butt, but that hasn't
deterred Mama one iota.
    And then we have the feral toms who come to the permanent bin feeder on the
porch as well, who have their own inter-relationships.     If you read any texts on cat behavior, you'll find dominance a well studied
attribute. Most say there is *always* an alpha cat, even if it isn't apparent to
the casual observer.

they weren't after a terrorist, they were after some poor souls library records
because they suspected him of something to do with drugs. And I'll bet you that
the vast majority of pig demands on libraries are in the same vein.    This one was on the web:
"The Virginia Public Library received a request for patron records from the
Deputy Sheriff. The staff member informed the officer he would need to talk to
the Director. Director Nancy Maxwell stated that she would check with the city
attorney. When he could not be located in time, she contacted ALS and was
advised to give them the information requested since it was accompanied by a
court order."
    Yup. That's their main interest. Fuck terrorists -- the pigs are only
interested if there is something to steal at the bust, like drugs or money, or
there might be property to grab. Just try and get them to do anything about
regular crime like enforcing disturbing the peace or drunk and disorderly. So,
of course, that's what they are using the unpatriot act for.

for the crimes and debts of the corp should be illegal. And there's nothing at

stockholders and highest paid employees get the longest sentences.    The concept that no one is actually responsible for the criminal acts of a

    Chickens ain't herbivores, they are omnivores, and, in fact, prefer meat,

Winter, and hung the carcasses just a bit off the ground so the chickens had to
hop a bit to peck at it, which kept them warm. And if you've ever seen them go
after a sick chicken, you'd know they are also cannabals.      In fact, if you were to hit your head or otherwise pass out in a chicken

as deep as they could. Likewise with any wound you had, say if you fell and hit

Or even his 17 year old virgin girlfriend. I really have a hard time
understanding how we reached this point -- it wasn't even 100 years ago when
girls of 17 were considered in danger of becoming old maids if they weren't
married already. In fact, when I was growing up, the legal age for marriage in
Mississippi was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, with parents permission. Without,
it was 14 and 16. Many, many states had similar laws. And, in fact, back then at
least one state, Maryland IIRC, had a "statutory rape" age of 8.    So, while on the one hand, more young teens are having sex fairly openly, and
at younger and younger ages, even in preteen, some as young as 10 from what I
read in the press; the laws are becoming more and more repressive. And not just
the law, also the prosecutors -- in Racine, WI a month or so ago it was
announced that prosecutors had charged a girl and boy, both 15, with having sex
with a child -- each other. WTF is going on?     What else is this but religious oppression? Look, I can marry a girl (with
parents okay) on her 16th birthday here in WI, but if I just have her come live
with me, I could spend probably most of the rest of my life in prison. This is
insane -- on what basis, under what Constitutional authority, does the state get
to decide that the christer "marriage" vows are sacred and legal, and a pagan or
indig "taking to wife" isn't?

You obviously have never done any door-to-door. People are quite often very
interested. We've had fairly good success organizing people on local issues
which affect them, like opposition to street widening. Voter registration is the
same thing.
   The mention was "giving talks in libraries", which works fairly well. The
local library is the logical meeting place for local groups to hold meetings and

All of the above, but mostly door-to-door voter registration. When you
consider that both klinton and dubbya were elected with only 13%-14% of the
eligible voters, it wouldn't take all that many new voters to really make a

Good grief -- algore is fucking pathological liar. That was just one example
among thousands. He can't even tell the truth about where and how he grew
up. Gore the lessor of two evils? As much as I despise dubbya, I can't say I'd
prefer gore -- but then I voted for Ralph, and will again. And voted libertarian
the two elections before that.    And the local elections are no prime pickings either, it's crooks to the left
of us, crooks to the right of us, ahead and behind, above and below. Extremely
few real choices. The real problem is -- most people don't vote. What needs to
be done is a real grass roots effort to educate people and get them to vote.

This last Memorial Day weekend, I was heading off to work at my fun historical
reinactor job at a state historic site (I get to run a 150 year old sawmill) and
dressed appropriately. My wife's car was parked behind mine in the driveway, so
I pulled hers out and into the neigbor's, pulled mine out onto the street, where
there is no parking -- but hey, FedEx and UPS stop there all the time, so do
contractors who are working on homes in the area and can't get their vehicles in
the driveways, this is a historic district afterall and driveways are pretty
damn small -- so just as I was about to get into my pickup and drive away, an
Oshkosh pig pulls up behind me, lights on. He says, "Is that your truck?" and I
say yes, I was just switching cars in the driveway. He says, as he gets out of
his car, "Step over here, please." Asks for my license, "You can't park
there." And I answer, "I'm not, I'm just switching cars."    Then things get more serious -- "I smell marijuana, do you know marijuana is
illegal?", which is total BS since it's been far too long. Then he says, "Do
you mind if I search you?", to which of course, I replied, "Yes I do, you have
no right to search me." I started to say, "Yeah, and I smell pigshit." but then
realized that if I did, I wouldn't probably wouldn't make it to my job. Normally
I would have escalated the scene as much as possible by bad mouthing him and his
mother as much as possible, but I really do enjoy playing at the historic site
and getting hauled to the jail for a few hours, even as much fun as that would
have been being as obnoxious as possible and giving them continual lectures
about how evil they are, how evil dubbya and asskruft are, how much I think that
people like them need to be rounded up and put into re-education centers and
given lobotomys so they can never bother decent people again -- still, I really
wanted to make it to the job.     So we were standing there at a bit of an impass, me saying "no, you cannot
search me." Then he says, "Well, for my own safety, I have a right to search you
for a weapon." I really, really, wish it had been some other time, so I could
have forced the issue and made him call for reinforcements, because it would
have been obvious to all and sundry that what this was really all about was the
big 3 foot tall lighted 24/7 peace sign on the roof of my house and the bumper
stickers on my truck and perhaps my hair, but -- ah well, maybe I'm getting old

   John Stauber spoke at the Midwest Renewable Energy Fair this last Solstice

My feeling is that Kerry won't be really any different, except possibly in
the areas of environment and education. He'll be about like Klinton, maybe
worse. And like Klinton, he's a lot smarter, so a lot more people will be
fooled. One thing about Dubbya, et al, is they make a lot of really dumb
mistakes. Look at Cheney telling Sen. Leahy to fuck himself -- these morons even
turn off a lot of Republicans.

Bumazhkas? I thought I was pretty familiar with most weapons of the world,
but not Bumazhkas. What calibre are they? I've always liked those CZ Model 52
pistols and Model 32 subguns in .30Mauser. Loaded hot with a teflon coated
bullet they should punch thru armor well.

Whoops, that should be "Model 23", not model 32. The 23 - 26 series from
whence the Uzi got it's basic design, IIRC.
