Normal forensics techniques would get around that by just imaging the
system and using a clean copy for each attempt. I'm not sure how it
would work in the presence of a TPM though since I haven't seen any FDE
that makes use of such a module yet. Guess would be it would hinder it
at least a little if done right.
If the system is logged in when its seized then there are a few DMA type
techniques that can image the whole memory before the machine is turned
off or there are the recent techniques of imaging RAM after a reboot,
this can allow the recovery of passwords/phrases in some circumstances.
