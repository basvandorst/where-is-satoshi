Interesting that a friend at work asked the very same question when I made that assertion.  My answer:  They don't, but their handlers certainly do.
Your piece eloquently supports my opinion that this was a large-
scale, well-planned operation.  It was not planned solely by the perps who carried out the missions.  Their handlers will not want to be easily identified, lest they draw nuclear fire.  Therefore, all the easily discovered clues will doubtless be diversionary.

I was wondering in a similar vein.  There are also the reports of the rented car found to contain Arabic-language flight training manuals, and the hotel room in Boston rented by persons sharing the names of suspect passengers on the hijacked flights.  NewsMax carries a story  that 5 suspects have been identified.
This is too easy.
The overt sophistication of this attack was such that I have a hard time believing the perps would leave so many obvious clues behind without intending to.  And if they intended to leave clues, the clues are almost certainly red herrings.
Interesting times, indeed.

Pretty sure it's a magstrip.  There's a definite bump across the cover, and the reader it was passed through didn't come up far enough to scan the name or other information.

My US passport does have a magstrip.  It's embedded in the front cover, and must be read by a special device.  I've seen it scanned only once, when leaving Montreal to return home.  (point being, a driver's licence reader can't read passport magstrips)
At least one club in Minneapolis has a prominent sign stating they will not accept a US passport as ID unless it's accompanied by a "yellow slip", that being the document indicating that the person has applied for a state-issued ID card.  I've never taken the time to ask the reasoning behind this policy.
It's probably reasonable to assume the formats differ.  I haven't yet had the time to build up a magstripe reader and check mine, but Minnesota also puts a high-density barcode on the front of the license.  I have read that out, and it's name, address, DOB, licence class, a couple of fields I can't figure out and a final field that says "20 EXTRA BYTES HERE".  (yes, really)

Believe it or not, I still have one mail route that travels over UUCP for the last link.  For the past 4 or 5 years, I've done UUCP over TCP/IP.  I'd think that one could tunnel that through SSL, though I've never tried to do it.
Heh... 19,200 was blazingly fast in those days, and the Telebit was set up for UUCP spoofing (the local modem faked the ACK packets to save turnaround time) to get better throughput.  Still, I think a 56K modem could outpull a Telebit.

Using a GPS coordinate set as keying material?  Hope it's just additional keying material.  Knowing the intended destination of something like a movie in transit to a theater seems pretty easy, and the set of GPS coordinates encompassing your average multiplex would seem to be pretty small compared to the usual keyspaces discussed here.

Applied Digital Solutions is pursuing the implantable chip after all.  It's not the GPS-trackable unit yet, but more like the doggie chips.  The L.A. Times story says it holds "up to 60 words" in one place, and "several sentences of information" in another.
Interesting that they plan to be to market in South America in 90 days (because of fewer required regulatory permissions).  They say they expect FDA and FCC approval here by midyear.
Anyone want to get barcoded?

This may have been discussed before, but a Google search has turned up lacking.
Given internet access from a private intranet, through an HTTP proxy out of the user's control, is it possible to establish a secure tunnel to an outside server?  I'd expect that ordinary SSL connections will secure user <-> proxy and proxy <-> server separately, with the proxy able to observe cleartext.  Could an SSH connection be made under these conditions?
Pointers appreciated, thanks.
