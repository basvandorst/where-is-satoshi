I was off the list for a while, and only rarely posted when I was on it. I just didn't have the time for the better part of a year. But, now I'm back into studying security/privacy/cryptography stuff so I'll probably be on the list again for a long while.

For a firewall, I'd recommend OpenBSD over just about anything else. Unless of course, there is hardware you need to use that isn't supported under OpenBSD.

But then, only if you use PGP (or GnuPG or what have you).

Just today, I started getting multiple copies of each message. Am I the only person this is happening to?
