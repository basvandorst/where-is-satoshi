You can run the same Tor, cross-compiled for ARM, running on a rooted
Kindle device. The Linux running under the Kindle UI/apps is
surprisingly standard in many ways, more so than Android even. However,
I have only been able to do this over wifi, and have not attempted it
through the 3G connection.
I ultimately don't think the 3G connection would work, as the proxy used
is an HTTP one, and not SOCKS. Until you can tunnel tor inside of HTTP,
then it won't really be possible technically.
In addition, I think Amazon is fairly stringent about bandwidth usage on
this 3G link, and I doubt you would get much use out of it for things
beyond their intended purpose, before you were shutdown.

Hash: SHA1
This is something we have definitely been considering as a feature or
add-on to Orbot - essentially mobile-to-mobile file sharing,
messaging/voice messaging via hidden services.
While we don't need a very complex p2p design (in short, we are mostly
just talking about simple HTTP servers running on each device, behind
a hidden service .onion), I am concerned in the long run about
scalability and reliability of this. It is not unheard of for apps
that work well and do something cool to suddently have 1M+ users, and
already are nearing half that with Orbot.
All the best,

Hash: SHA1
I can tell you that based on prototype code I have created, SMS and
VoIP type p2p applications between mobile devices works just fine. The
latency is not bad, especially since the apps are coded to be
asynchronous anyhow. Whether it takes 10 seconds or 1 minute for
someone to respond does not bother users.
Hidden Services as a globally anonymous NAT'd networked is an amazing
opportunity for this type of application. We just need to solve the
scalability problem so we do not, as Robert put it "thrash the hidden
services directory".

Glad to know. I think the extension is here is that we are also doing it
on a 3G mobile connection, and in my case, from a fairly rural part of
the world.
Wow, Opus looks great, both for one-way and two-way audio.
Definitely thinking about that sort of thing, as well, but in this case,
my real focus is on broadcast/consume mode.
Thanks for the feedback!

Proof that streaming media, well at least radio, can work well over
mobile Tor.
This uses TCP-based progressive download of audio, and not true UDP/RTP
-------- Original Message --------
Organization: The Guardian Project
As a test, I just made this "NPToR News" based on the NPR open source
news/podcasting app... NPR = the U.S.-based National Public Radio
service. They offer their app and API as open-source/open-protocol code
I am happy to report that listening to the radio over Tor is a pretty
decent experience, even over 3G.
I've modified the app to:
1) use HTTPS connections with the OnionKit's StrongHTTPClient and
StrongTrustManager. You will see a "Secure Connection Active" notify in
the notification bar, for example, when it connects.
2) use HTTP Proxying to Orbot's Privoxy/Tor localhost 8118 proxy
3) use the OrbotHelper to check if Orbot is installed/running and prompt
the user appropriately to resolve any issues
4) removed all Google tracking, advert display in the app
You can find the project here:

It is a bit of a tangent, but understanding new ways in which Tor
running on a smartphone might be compromised could be useful.
Otherwise, happy to have the thread move here:

- From what I know, there has been nothing specific done (yet) in the
Guardian ROM work to combat baseband attacks.
Something interesting about the Nexus 4:
It appears to have two separate "modem" chips, perhaps related to
extended support for LTE:
Qualcomm WTR1605L Seven-Band 4G LTE chip
Qualcomm MDM9215M 4G GSM/UMTS/LTE modem
Searching for either of those parts online reveals a good amount of
documentation, but not many specifics related to Android.

It comes down to what are you afraid of?
If it is dragnet surveillance, logging, censorship and other
networked-based threats, then using Orbot, ChatSecure, TextSecure,
SilentCircle, RedPhone, etc, makes a lot of sense. If you are living
in Turkey, and you are trying to get to Twitter, using Orbot on your
phone and setting the Twitter app's proxy to localhost:8118, solves
your problem. If you don't want your SMS message history logged by
your telco (or a state-sponsored surveillance system), then using
TextSecure or ChatSecure solves the problem as well.
However, if there is any chance that you are under threat for a
targeted attack, then the requirements for "secure" are many orders of
magnitude higher. In this case, as others have said on the thread,
using a non-baseband mobile device (like a Nexus tablet) with as open
firmware as possible (replicant, omnirom), and without Google
Apps/Accounts, gets your pretty far.
