It was at a five o'clock tea. A young man came to the hostess to apologize
for his lateness."So good of you to come, Mr. Jones, and where is your
brother?""You see we're very busy in the office and only one of us could
come, so we tossed up for it.""How nice! And so original, too! And you

by an honest little boy and returned to her. Looking in her purse, she
commented, "Hmmm.... That's funny. When I lost my bag there was a $20 bill
in it. Now there are twenty $1 bills." The boy quickly replied, "That's
right, lady. The last time I found a lady's purse, she didn't have any
change for a reward."
