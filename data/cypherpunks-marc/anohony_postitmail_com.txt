Begin your s.aving.s now. Quit:  A man who wanted to rest on the ground used a jar as a pillow. It was so
hard that he asked his servant to staff it with feathers to make it soft. A
pupil was talking about the recent fire in his school. "I knew it was going
to happen." he said, "Because we've been practicing for it all
year".Computer manufacturers are considering changing the instructional
words "Press Any Key" to "Press Return Key", because too many people have

One evening, in the midst of dinner preparation, our 10-year-old daughter
asked, "Mommy, what's puberty?" My wife was rushed at the moment, so she
suggested that Peggy look up the word in the dictionary, after which they
could talk about it.A few minutes later, Peggy returned. Her mother asked
what the dictionary had said. "Puberty means," announced Peggy, "the
earliest age at which a girl is able to bear children.""What do you think of
that?" my wife asked."I'm not sure," Peggy relied. "I've always been able to
bear children. It's adults I can't bear.".
