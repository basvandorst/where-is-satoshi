If authentication fails, the phone can choose not to charge at the maximum
rate. Current draw is totally within the control of the phone's internal
battery charging circuitry. Lower current, less chance of fire.
The charger presents its power capabilities via USB-PD, it's up to the
phone to select which one it wants to use.
Right, no amount of magic crypto will protect a device from this. And a USB
cable with VBUS/GND swapped is usually enough to fry a laptop[1].
You're right to be suspicious, and I imagine there's some truth in this.
But as you say, these companies are already using their own proprietary
charger authentication protocols. This spec is at least providing a common
protocol to allow different vendors' products to authenticate, if they wish
to do so.
