None if we dont talk about it or look at it.
My personal hunch is that its only WinNT4 source from looking at the
source tree layout. Not to say they had anything to do with this
It would be in microsofts favor to release the NT source code because
1. They can say NT is insecure move to Win2k3 and beyond
2. They can pull a SCO on us and Anyone else that tries to reimplement
the win32 API and NT kernel without a source license.
