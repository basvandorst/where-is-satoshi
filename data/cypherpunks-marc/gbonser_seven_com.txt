It was reported in the last couple of days that Wikileaks could have been taken off the net but the govt decided not to do it.
As for a member of Congress pressuring Amazon, what else would one expect?  If a site has content that the USG might see as "damaging", and if a US company is facilitating the distribution of that content, sure, I would expect members of that government to apply "pressure" but I have no idea what that "pressure" might have consisted of. But think about it ... if someone had, for example, deep internal corporate confidential financial information on a company and published that on the web, that company might also attempt to "pressure" the publishing entity to stop it.
To expect someone not to "pressure" someone to remove potentially damaging material is probably naïve.

Is anyone actually using Ubuntu 6.06LTS anymore?  That was published for
Q1 2008, that was almost three years ago which in "internet years" is a
long time.
One also has to wonder (since the link to the original paper seems to be
dead) if that was "out of the box" 6.06LTS or 6.06LTS kept updated with
the security releases.

It was designed to be robust but it wasn't designed to survive nuclear
war. There WERE some networks that were designed to survive, though, so
maybe some have confused them.  I think what I hear seems to confuse
MILNET with MILSTAR where MILNET was the military portion of the
Internet (what has eventually evolved into NIPRNet) and MILSTAR which is
a satellite network designed to be nuclear survivable.  When it
absolutely positively has to get there.

UUCP works just fine over TCP/IP and works with Exim and Postfix (I have
used both with UUCP over TCP/IP) with regular ARPA style addresses (@
addressing).  Might be worthwhile to set up just to keep in practice.
Once served as an MX host for a local family that moved overseas for a
while and they had their own domain.  They would connect to the Internet
when they could, connect to me and pull the family's mail by UUCP over
TCP/IP.  That wasn't that long ago (less than 10 years ago).
It is actually a pretty decent way to collect email for an entire domain
when you have only intermittent connectivity.

Having a DNS server and MX host outside the borders of the country would
help as well.
I believe that any "attack" is likely to come from within, not from an
external source.  It would seem most likely to me that some malware
would be spread around ahead of time that does nothing to bother the
host until it is time for it to act.  At that point, cutting off
international links will have little/no impact and would possibly be the
entire goal of the event.  Shutting down the Internet would be "mission
accomplished".  The government should be, in my opinion, focusing its efforts on how it
can best facilitate a coordination of efforts to A: profile the traffic
so it can be blocked B: locate infected nodes so they can be
disconnected or disinfected.
The source of the attack is not likely going to be network
infrastructure but instead the millions of end user devices out there.  Questions like: who is monitoring traffic and noting traffic profiles of
malware and developing some mechanism for distributing those traffic
profiles to network operators so they can be blocked or otherwise acted
How can that distribution channel be made "robust" in the face of a
general public network breakdown?
Is there a need for some sort of an operational "order wire" network
that interconnects network operators as sort of an "out of band"
communications path for handling emergency coordination among operators?
What would be the connectivity requirements for such a network?
The government could be a lot of help in keeping the network up in the
face of attack rather than simply shutting it off.  The emphasis should
be on keeping it working, not how to most efficiently shut it down.

The federal government clearly has the authority to manage
communications across the border of the country and between states but
it would be questionable if the federal government has the authority to
manage any communications completely within a state.  Do they have the
authority to tell me to turn down a connection that terminates within
the same state that I am in?  Sure, they would have the authority to tell me to turn down any
international tunnels I might have running or a point-to-point that
crosses state lines but I doubt they have the authority to tell me to
turn down a cross-connect terminating in the same building.  That would
be the jurisdiction of state authority, not federal.

Nope, no paper copies.  In fact, many of the documents such as maps and dra=

I agree, Mike.  Problem is that the communications infrastructure that enab=
les these sorts of options is generally so reliable people don't think abou=
t what will happen if something happens between them and their data that ta=
kes out their access to those services.  Imagine a situation where several =
municipal governments in, say, Santa Cruz County, California are using such=
 services and there is a repeat of the Loma Prieta quake.  Their data survi=
ves in Santa Clara county, their city offices survive but there is consider=
able damage to infrastructure and structures in their jurisdiction.  But th=
e communications is cut off between them and their data and time to repair =
is unknown.  The city is now without email service.  Employees in one depar=
tment can't communicate with other departments.  Access to their files is g=
one.  They can't get the maps that show where those gas lines are.  The loc=
al file server that had all that information was retired after the document=
s were transferred to "the cloud" and the same happened to the local mail s=
erver.  At this point they are "flying blind" or relying on people's memori=
es or maybe a scattering of documents people had printed out or saved local=
 copies of.  It's going to be a mess.
The point is that "the cloud" seems like a great option but it relies on be=
ing able to reach that "cloud".  Your data may be safe and sound and your o=
ffice may have survived without much wear, but if something happens in betw=

Or your cloud provider might announce they are going out of that business n=

Entire governments in the US are using "cloud storage" for their documentat=

in Google Docs for just this purpose and I know of at least one city on Cal=

mail.  In case of an emergency where Google is unreachable, they are in a w=
