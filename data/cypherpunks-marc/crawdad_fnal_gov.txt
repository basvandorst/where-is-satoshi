As I never tire of saying, "PKI is the ATM of security."

proponents to be the answer to every need, and is the current magic
word for shaking the money tree.

Unless the application author can predict the exact output of the
compilers, he can't issue a signature on the object code.  The
compilers then have to be inside the trusted base, checking a
signature on the source code and reflecting it somehow through a
signature they create for the object code.

Each CN is in a single-element RDN as usual. Netscape honors only the
first CN in the SubjectDN, but will treat it as a restricted regex
(shell-like * wildcard, alternation and grouping). IE checks the
server name against each CN's individually.
This was mainly determined by experimentation.  I think we did find a
limit on how long that first regex could be, but I don't remember
what it was.  Longer than my example, but short enough that some of
our bigger virtual-hosting servers were inconvenienced by it.
Openssl has no qualms about multiple same-type components.  You just
have to use the somewhat documented
0.commonName = ...
1.commonName = ...
2.commonName = ...
in the configuration file.

True as written, but Netscrape ind Internet Exploder each have a hack
for honoring the same cert for multiple server names.  Opera seems to
honor at least one of the two hacks, and a cert can incorporate both
at once.
Waste?  Heck no, that's what they're for!

For many years in the 90's there was (maybe still is) a resident of Cook County, Illinois, who refused to vote because she was the only voter in her precinct, and the precinct totals would consist purely of her vote.

If you think of POW as a possible SPAM mitigation, how does the first receiving MTA assure the next MTA in line that a message was "paid for?"  Certainly the mail relay doesn't want to do new work, but the second MTA doesn't know that the first isn't a spambot.

The comment period on NIST's draft FIPS-201 (written in very hasty  response to Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12) ends  tomorrow.  The draft, as written, enables use of the card by "Smart  IEDs" and for improved selection of kidnapping victims.
One cabinet department's Associate CIO for Cybersecurity said of this  project, "Eventually this is going to lead to a national ID card."

That would be the thinking of a thief who read the article and took it at face value.  A more clever thief would realize that the magic water would respond to *his* ultraviolet light just as well as the police's.  (And in today's climate, the counter-counteraction will be a measure to outlaw ultraviolet lights in the hands of private citizens ...)
