        Traded: OTC Pink Sheets Press Release         Source: Billy Martin's USA, Inc.         -- Expanding East and West Via CyberAds, Inc.
        Thursday November 18, 5:00 am ET LOS ANGELES,         Nov. 18, 2004 (PRIMEZONE) -- Billy Martin's USA, Inc. (Other OTC:BLYM.PK         - News) announced today that they have executed an agreement to support         the online and direct response marketing of its internationally known         western-lifestyle apparel and accessories brand, whose products heretofore         have been sold via the Company's upscale boutiques in New York City and         Hollywood on the Sunset Strip.
        Per the agreement, CyberAds, Inc. (OTC BB:CYAD.OB - News) will be working         closely with BLYM and its new product design team to produce a direct         Internet sales and direct response marketing program targeted to consumers         -- both in the U.S. and abroad -- who are looking for authentic USA-made         goods with a distinctive American or "western'' flavor and character.
Doug Newton,         CEO of BLYM noted, "This agreement gives us the opportunity to expand         on the Internet and tap into the market of foreign consumers like never         before. Potentially, there is a huge, untapped, sleeping giant of a market         outside the U.S. for well-made American branded goods, especially in Japan,         China and Russia where young, active consumers with disposable incomes         are increasingly embracing e-commerce.''
"With CyberAds'         expertise in Internet and direct marketing, we can expose our products         across oceans and borders alike, in a highly cost-efficient manner.''
"The Billy         Martin's brand is about as American as you can get, and when you combine         that with well-made, great fitting, and well-priced goods -- like a classic         denim shirt with pearl snap buttons -- the consumer is given a product         of value, prestige and character,'' Newton concluded.
Statements         about BLYM's future expectations, including revenues and earnings, and         all other statements in this release are "forward-looking statements.''         Since these statements involve risks and uncertainties and are subject         to change at any time, the company's actual results may differ materially         from the company's plans if its assumptions prove to be incorrect, or,         for a variety of other reasons. Billy Martin's USA, Inc. became public         in October 2001, via reverse merger with Hitech Resource Corp. which changed         its corporate name to Billy Martin's USA, Inc. after completing the acquisition         of Billy Martin's Western Wear, LA, Inc. Shares of its stock trade under         the symbol "BLYM.'' The company is currently not an SEC reporting         company.
