Useful. Thank you.
With those two, I was able to get my number down to:
    ...only one in 203,627 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours
(Whereas before, I was "unique among the 3,461,672 tested so far".)
Going further, using NoScript, Ghostery, *and* User Agent Switcher
0.7.3, aiming for the "middle of the population bulge" by selecting:
    Browsers - Windows > Firefox 21.0.1 (Win 8 64)
(even though I'm running Iceweasel under Debian), I was able to get my
Panopticlick number down to:
    ...only one in 8,088 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours
One can fetch the large list of user agents I used for this experiment
from this page of the author of User Agent Switcher:
    where he mentions (points to):
    The file there is useragentswitcher.xml and can be imported directly by
User Agent Switcher (Tools > Default User Agent > User Agent Switcher >
Options... > Import/Export > Import...).
"Whereas economic man maximises, selects the best alternative from among
all those available to him, his cousin, administrative man, 'satisfices',
looks for a course of action that is satisfactory or 'good enough'. Be-
cause he treats the world as rather empty and ignores the interrelated-
ness of all things (so stupefying to thought and action), administrative
man can make decisions with relatively simple rules of thumb that do not
make impossible demands upon his capacity for thought." --Herbert Simon
