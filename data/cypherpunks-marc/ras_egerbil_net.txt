Not to be too picky, but how is going from "doubling every 2 years" to "doubling every 18 months" slowing down? :)

Personally I'm not too concerned (yet). You're probably worse off due to implementation flaws.
But on a list of things which "should be fixed" for the future: Any RSA
implementation using RSARef (which until the patent expired was the only
legal way to write RSA implementations in the US) is limited to < 1024
I can think of a few vendors using embedded SSH who still suffer from this
problem (Vendor F comes to mind, but their SSH implementation also doesn't
work with OpenSSH w/freebsd localisations, so something else is afoot
there as well).
