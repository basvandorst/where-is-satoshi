For the map-obsessed, this one shows the depth of support for
President Feckless in the global community. Pretty goddam impressive
I'd say. I takes true flair to blow off so many former clients and
fair weather friends in so short a time.
And oh yes, for the benefit of Mr. Bean at the Boston Globe, Frank
Gehry got his Canadian passport back three or four years ago.
Prescient I'd say; visionary even.
