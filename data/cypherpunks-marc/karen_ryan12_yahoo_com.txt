        Voice Mail Greetings
- fun for your mobile phone
        Greetings is the new and exciting way to customise your mobile phone.  
        Imagine your friends' amazement when Britney Spears answers your
        phone or their surprise when Bart Simpson greets them in his inimitable
        style.
        a greeting to your mobile phones voicemail couldnt be simpler. 
        Start by choosing a greeting, some of which are listed below. 
        Then call our service number (below), enter the greeting number,
        your mobile phone number, voice mail PIN number and select your phones
        network.
0906 636 1280*
        in order for the service to work, you must know and change your mobile
        phone's voicemail PIN number from the default.  
        Instructions for this can be found on the web site or by dialing the service number and choosing option three.
        Calls to this premium rate number are charged at £1.50 per minute,
        lasting on average three minutes.  If
        necessary, remember to get permission from the bill payer.  Calls
        to premium rate mobiles may be charged at higher rates than land line
        phones.
