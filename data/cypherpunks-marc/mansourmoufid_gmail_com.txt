Are we so sure there are no methods of correlation with zero false
positive rate [P(C|~M) = 0]?

Please do, this attack you mention is one I've been very interested
in. I'm sure many others would also love to read more about it.
It's time the myth of the GPA was challenged. I don't think active
correlation attacks can be defended against, but I think they can at
least be detected.

Very true, unfortunately, almost all publicly available steganography is worthless. But that's just an opportunity to do better, and there's promising research. Check out:

Very interesting read.
I'm not sure I buy the theories for the new data centre. Drive capacity
has increased on the same order of magnitude as Internet traffic, [1,2]
so I doubt the increase in traffic from current targets is the reason
for it. I also doubt extending the surveilled set by 5% to include the
US is the reason.
Besides, according to the whistleblowers, everything that's attributed
to it has been going on for a long time. Unless there's concrete evidence
I haven't heard of, I tend to believe it actually is for "cybersecurity",
specifically the insider threat. These agencies monitor their own people
(and soon-to-be corporate partners) far more than the public.
On that note, apparently there's half a dozen versions of HR 3523 around,
and NSA versus DHS (aka "the happy face") is an artificial distinction,
meant to appease. [3]
Anyway, I think cryptography will depend more and more on steganography

Gitian can build projects deterministically such that the result can be
corroborated by many parties:
I don't know if it can be used with the app stores but it shows that the
process is doable for those who really care. Personally I think time is
better spent on static analysis for example.

Sure it is. XTS-AES must be rekeyed after each terabyte; WEP was limited
by a 24-bit initialization vector; etc. There are always limits, but
sometimes they are literally astronomical.

FYI --
Photojournalists and filmmakers call on camera makers to include encryption
Filmmakers and photojournalists have their cameras and footage seized 'at a
rate that is literally too high to count,' according to the Freedom of the
Press Foundation.
Now you look suspicious and they'll just take your camera if you don't give
the password.
Encryption also makes it impossible to recover photos after you are forced
to delete them.
