You miss the point.
Re-read the link I provided that explains how TrueCrypt implements  hidden volumes. A hidden TrueCrypt volume is *completely  indistinguishable* from empty space in a regular TrueCrypt volume.  That's what makes it hidden!
As I implied in the 2004 message in the context of political  dissidents, a good use for hidden volumes isn't to distract your  prosecutor with kittens and sunsets. That's just plain stupid,  regardless of whether you're dealing with a US judge or someone whose  preferred method of communication involves a pair of pliers and a  The idea is to present an alternative but *plausible* set of  information that's far less incriminating than the real deal, such as  only mildly illegal material or legal material that the owner would  still plausibly wish to keep secret for social reasons. I gave you a  concrete example: hardcore or fetish porn (legal, but plausibly not  the kind of thing whose possession you wish to advertise) provided to  investigators to mask a secret volume with kiddie porn.
If you give me the benefit of the doubt for having a reasonable  general grasp of the legal system and not thinking the judge is an  automaton or an idiot, can you explain to me how you think the judge  can meet the burden of proof for contempt in this instance? Surely you  don't wish to say that anyone using encryption can be held in contempt  on the _chance_ they're not divulging all the information; what, then,  is the other explanation?

Why do you think it'd be obvious to you and me that a disk has  multiple encrypted views? Contempt carries a burden of proof. If the  guy has two encrypted volumes, one with a bunch of hardcore adult porn  and the other with a bunch of kiddie porn, how does his unlocking the  first one give you a 'preponderance of evidence' that he's obstructing  justice or disobeying the court? It becomes a he-said-she-said with  the CBP agent, your word against his.
