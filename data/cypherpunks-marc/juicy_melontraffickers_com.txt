Turns up a lot of info on the various substances that have been tried as "truth drugs."
The first hit is about MDMA:
I seem to recall that MDA (very similar to MDMA) was in fact used in US
Army studies of truth drugs.
The most likely to have some measure of sucess would probably be MDMA.  However, no chemical is likely to be found that forces a subject to tell
the truth. The most successful "truth drugs" all generally work on the
same idea: if you can make your subject more relaxed, at ease, and eager
to talk, you'll be able to extract more information from him and possibly
extrapolate the truth from that.
MDMA would have a greater degree of success in cases where the subject subconsciously wanted to talk anyway.

The War Prayer
by Mark Twain
It was a time of great and exalting excitement. The country was up in arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism; the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy pistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and spluttering; on every hand and far down the receding and fading spread of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun; daily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new uniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, panting, to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts, and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country, and invoked the God of Battles beseeching His aid in our good cause in outpourings of fervid eloquence which moved every listener. It was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to disapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its righteousness straightway got such a stern and angry warning that for their personal safety's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended no more in that way. Sunday morning came -- next day the battalions would leave for the front; the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their young faces alight with martial dreams -- visions of the stern advance, the gathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce pursuit, the surrender! Then home from the war, bronzed heroes, welcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor, there to win for the flag, or, failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. The service proceeded; a war chapter from the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose, with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation     *God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest! Thunder thy clarion and lightning     thy sword!* Then came the "long" prayer. None could remember the like of it for passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. The burden of its supplication was, that an ever-merciful and benignant Father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers, and aid, comfort, and encourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them in the day of battle and the hour of peril, bear them in His mighty hand, make them strong and confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag and country imperishable honor and glory -- An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness. With all eyes following him and wondering, he made his silent way; without pausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and stood there waiting. With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued with his moving prayer, and at last finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal, "Bless our arms, grant us the victory, O Lord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!" The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside -- which the startled minister did -- and took his place. During some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes, in which burned an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said: "I come from the Throne -- bearing a message from Almighty God!" The words smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention. "He has heard the prayer of His servant your shepherd, and will grant it if such shall be your desire after I, His messenger, shall have explained to you its import -- that is to say, its full import. For it is like unto many of the prayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of -- except he pause and think. "God's servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and taken thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two -- one uttered, the other not. Both have reached the ear of Him Who heareth all supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this -- keep it in mind. If you would beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the same time. If you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are possibly praying for a curse upon some neighbor's crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it. "You have heard your servant's prayer -- the uttered part of it. I am commissioned of God to put into words the other part of it -- that part which the pastor -- and also you in your hearts -- fervently prayed silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so! You heard these words: 'Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!' That is sufficient. the *whole* of the uttered prayer is compact into those pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory--*must* follow it, cannot help but follow it. Upon the listening spirit of God fell also the unspoken part of the prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words. Listen! "O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle

Incredible.  Abso-fucking-lutely incredible.  After telling us all about
the poor little child pornographer, Larry Benedict, and how the mean
old police are out to get him, Declan finally lets the other shoe drop
in part 5 of this 5-part series.
Benedict pled guilty.
He pled guilty, agreeing to a plea bargain calling for 37 months in
This "innocent" man agreed to spend 3 years in prison for something he
didn't do.  He agreed to brand himself for life as a child pornographer,
setting himself up for 3 years of hell in prison where child pornographers
are the lowest of the low.  All this when supposedly all he really did was
trade some computer games.

   arrested and charged with very serious felonies involving child
   pornography -- I don't think most people would wait several years
   and plead guilty (if) in fact they had done nothing wrong."
Wouldn't it have been relevant to let us know this essential fact about
the case back when the series began?  Wouldn't it have colored our

@_subject: Re: Pay per use remailers and remailer reliability tracking. 
It's largely a myth that the set of users of remailers is anonymous.
Remailer operators collectively know them all; individual operators know
a substantial percentage of them if people vary the remailers they use;
anyone surveilling the remailer network knows them all.  Hiding one's
membership in the set of remailer users cannot be a high priority.
And there's no need for remailer users to be anonymous, either.  Anyone
should be proud to be counted as a member of that group.  It's no more
incriminating than being a subscriber to the cypherpunks mailing list
or any of dozens of similar lists.  No doubt thousands of people would
put their names on the list even if they have no intention of ever
using remailers.
Part of the problem has been focus on adding features to mixmaster
rather than improving security and reliability.  Transparent remixing
(where the remailer chooses part of the path for you), support for
the old insecure cypherpunk mode, automated flood detection, all add
administrative complexity for questionable benefit.  With a good high
speed connection, floods and such are much less of an issue.  Things like
remixing should be done by the clients; it was a mistake to put this
into the remailer software.
Absolutely.  For all those people saying, what can I do to support
remailers, here's an easy answer: use them.  Get a client, figure out how
it works, and send an anonymous message or two.  It doesn't hurt.  Much.
You may even find it liberating.  Challenge the orthodoxy and start
thinking for yourself.
You skipped step 0, which is to inform people of what it is like to run
a remailer.  It doesn't do anyone any good for remailers to pop up and
immediately shut down when the complaints come in.  Here's a good litmus
test: if you wouldn't be able to spam at reasonably high volumes from
your address without getting shut down, you probably shouldn't be
trying to run a remailer (unless in middleman mode).
A good idea.  See the recent proposal for a P2P style always-connected
remailer network which will bypass sendmail and all the other RFC2822
cruft.  Plugable transports would be a great way to accomplish this.
Eric Hughes had a cool idea a while back: encourage CP technologies
by allowing them to bypass built-in mailing list latency.  Create a
CP node which forwards PGP-signed and remailed messages with higher
priority than others.  Signing up for this node is a way of showing
support for freedom enhancing technology.
Maybe Tim May could donate his Y2K beans and rice as a prize, since he's
never been willing to use his millions to subsidize bonuses of this type.
Keep in mind that our perception of remailers is at odds with that of
the world at large.  Fellow travellers like the EFF can't afford to be
that closely tied to a technology which most people view as an obnoxious
nuisance at best and a terrorist tool at worst.
Absolutely.  Simplicity and reliability have been overlooked as goals
for the remailer network.  You shouldn't start adding new features until
the old ones (like successfully remailing messages without dropping
them) work.
Nevertheless there is a political over-reaction to commercial spam, and it
can be a major source of complaints about the remailer.  Per-link hashcash
would be a better deterrant than black lists, which ultimately depend
on entry remailers to do a favor for exit remailers.
Split out the client, including web-based clients, from the server.
They have different needs.  If you want to promote good, reliable
servers there is no need to also make them be web clients.
The Freedom network had the right idea here: pipenet access to an ordinary
POP mailbox.  If remailers are joined in an always-connected P2P network
it could be used as a specialized pipenet for just this purpose.  No ZKS
anti-abuse nym protocols necessary since exit points would be restricted
to the special POP mailboxes.
other work first, before they could really benefit from the effort >
required to create an ecash system from scratch, deploy it, scale it,
system isn't worthwhile for its own sake, though :)
Non-monetary ecash does have one advantage over hashcash for proof of
work postage: it is transferable.  With hashcash, once it's spent,
it's gone and can't be reused.  With ecash (purchased by hashcash)
the payee gets to keep it and can spend it himself in the future.
In other words, remailer operators would build up riches in ecash.  Now,
all it's good for is sending anonymous messages, so they're not going
to retire on it.  But still this can fund pingers run (or paid for)
by the remops themselves.
And there could eventually be a secondary market in remailer ecash.
Remailer users would seek it as an alternative to hashcash if it were
easier to get.  They might be willing to perform services in exchange
for remailer ecash payment.  This could produce some backing for the
currency and it might come to be traded even among people who had no
desire to use remailers.  (Services might be, e.g. ripping a requested
copy protected CD via an analog connection, or digitizing a TV show
unavailable to the requestor.)

BBC News | ENGLAND | Students debate Israel 'apartheid'
      Students debate Israel 'apartheid'
Large numbers of students are expected to converge on Manchester University to demonstrate over an attempt to brand Israel an "apartheid state". A motion being proposed by a Manchester University student and supported by the Islamic Society, argues that Israel is carrying out human rights abuses against Palestinians. Students from across the country are travelling to the city to support and protest against the action on Wednesday. If it is passed, Jewish students fear anti-Semitic sentiment will lead to the ban of Jewish societies within universities and fuel prejudice. General secretary of the university's Students' Union, Andrew Perfect said tensions on campus were running "fairly high". He said they were expecting at least 1,000 people in the debating hall, students outside and people from the local community. He said: "This is a human rights motion regarding abuses against the people of Palestine. "The proposal draws a parallel between South African and Israeli apartheid and human rights abuse. "We are expecting at least 1,000 of our 24,000 members to vote, with lots of others outside, as well as a large number of people from around the country and a number from the community."       Heated debate The motion is expected to be debated for most of the afternoon. Greater Manchester Police have been notified of the expected crowds and are sending officers to the event. A police spokeswoman said: "We are aware of it and there will be a low key presence to ensure it passes off peacefully." Mr Perfect said: "Tensions are fairly high on campus at the moment. "But this is not the first time something like this has happened. In 1996, a group of students tried to ban the Jewish Society." A spokesman for the university said they had read the motion and were satisfied it was "a legitimate debate". He said: "The motion relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine and that is why some kind of heat has been generated. "We are expecting it to be quite heated."
Islamic Society at Manchester University Dear Friends, Peace Be Upon You.
We would like to bring to your attention that students at Manchester University have felt that there is a need to condemn the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in their own homeland, by the racist 'Israeli' apartheid regime, on an official level.
A motion detailing the atrocities and blatant disregard for human rights was submitted to the Students Union to be discussed and voted on in a general meeting next Wednesday the 27th of Feb. at 1.30pm in the Academy.
Unfortunately, certain groups opposing this motion (hmm, I wonder who that could be?!), have sunk to all time new lows in trying to divert the attention away from the issue up for discussion.  They have resorted to attempted provocation and outright childish behaviour in an attempt to stop this motion.
However, those supporting the motion, have been ignoring these pathetic attempts, much to the despair of those opposed to it.

Jerry Bruckheimer's The Siege: Take home the Intifada on VHS or DVD Today!
There was always one thing that about this movie that seemed
unrealistic.  It wasn't the segregation of the Arab community behind
checkpoints in a borough of New York.  Nor was it the deployment of
the Army to keep order in the streets.  It wasn't the detention of all
adult Arab males in camps on 'suspicion'.
It wasn't even the torture or summary execution of terrorist suspects
by the Army, or the unfeasibility of the ending.  In short, it wasn't
any of the usual suspects.
What bugged me, and purely from a tactical standpoint, was the Army's
rocket attack on a terrorist cell's base of operations.  Surely the
Army had ground (as well as air) superiority over New York City? Surely, the Army's wisest course was to take the terrorists in alive,
and their equipment intact, in order to gain intelligence from them?
Yes, helicopters firing rockets into buildings makes for big
bang-bangs (and probably a few more bucks at the box office) but until
now Mr Bruckheimer had been relatively restrained in the pyrotechnics
and car chases department.  Yes, firing over the heads of the FBI who
were trying to 'apprehend suspects' in the same building, showed a
fundamental difference between the goals of law enforcers and national
security providers. Yesterday, the answer hit me like a baton round to a vital organ.
Watching the news, I saw an article about Palestinian men being
rounded up, en masse, from a village on the grounds that they all knew
'something' about 'someone'.  This did not look to me like an
investigation.  It looked like a reprisal.  Watching them as they were
led around blindfolded, I remembered the mass detention camp hastily
built in a football field.
'The Siege' was not a movie about a hypothetical attack on New York by
Islamist Terrorists, and an equally hypothetical overreaction by the
Executive Branch.  'The Siege' was about daily life for three-quarters
of a million Palestinians, seventy percent of them refugees;
metaphorically transplanted to America's doorstep in order to increase
audience identification.

@_subject: RE: 1024-bit RSA keys in danger of compromise 
Solving discrete logs via NFS is structurally similar to factoring.
You start off with a factor base and generate a large number of
relations among the elements in that set.  You then look for a linear
dependency among these relations, which amounts to solving a large matrix.
Since the techniques are similar, Dan Bernstein's ideas probably apply
to both cases.
However there are some significant differences, mostly in the second
phase, the matrix reduction.  The matrix solution in the case of
factoring is over GF(2).  This means that all the elements are 0's and
1's, that "addition" is just XOR, and that "multiplication" is just AND.
This simplifies the problem and Bernstein uses a trick to speed up matrix
multiplication in this field.
Bernstein's insight is that matrix multiplication in GF(2) is essentially
just a matching problem.  When you have two 1's being multiplied together,
you keep them; if either one is a 0, you can eliminate that.  During the
addition, if you have two matching elements, they cancel; if they are
unlike elements, they produce a 1.  So what he does is to put the data
into a giant sorting engine.  This brings the corresponding elements
close together.  Then a couple of passes of these matching rules gives
the result.
The matrix solution for discrete log is over a larger field, the size of
the large prime that divides p-1; 1023 bits for a strong 1024 bit key.
You don't have just 0's and 1's, and you no longer have simple matching
rules.  The field operations are non-trivial.
This will have several effects.  First, the cells of the solver will have
to be larger; in addition to storing row and column numbers, they have to
store a large numeric value.  Second, the cells will have to include much
more complex logic; instead of just comparing with their neighbors and
looking for matches, they have to do modular multiplication and addition.
And third, the algorithm will change during the addition phase; a series
of values have to be added together, rather than just counting whether
there are an even or odd number.  This probably doesn't increase the
asymptotic number of steps, though.
So the matrix solver will be considerably larger, but if the factoring
version were buildable, the DL version probably could be built as well.
Given the increased complexity of the cell, from doing ANDs of ~40 bit
numbers to doing modular multiplication of ~1000 bit values, a very rough
guess is that it will be 1000 times more expensive.  It may be possible
to compensate for this greater cost by using a smaller factor base.
The first phase in both algorithms involves finding numbers smooth over a
factor base, so again the success of a factoring engine probably implies
that the discrete log machine would work, too.
Summing up, Bernstein's techniques would require some modification for
solving discrete logs, and the details of the asymptotic analysis would
probably not be exactly the same, but broadly speaking the same general
techniques would apply.  If his machine factors 1024 bit numbers at
some reasonable expense, 1024 bit discrete log keys would have to be
considered unsafe as well.

Falling into camp "I resemble that remark," here's a bit of history on one
of the worlds' most common epithets against the legal profession.  While
this remark has been reduced to a slogan or jingle, placed in context, the
line makes a profound statement on the conflict between rule of law and
anarchy (or, perhaps more relevant today, the conflict between rule of law
and a police state).  As eloquently employed by Justice Stevens
below, "Shakespeare insightfully realized that disposing of lawyers is a
step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government."
Henry VI is the son of much beloved Henry V, and his legacy includes the
bloody Wars of the Roses, embroiling England in generations of civil war.  Described as "a high-class soap opera," throughout its three parts, Henry
VI sees the beleaguered king faced by threats from within his court,
from the nobility, from the French and from uprisings among the common
people. One of these uprisings was led by Jack Cade.  Cade and his men wished to
present grievances to the king. The king received their petitions and then
gathered an army to destroy them. Cade's men then routed the troops sent
to subdue them and ended up capturing London. Although Cade was initially
welcomed into London, his men soon engaged in selective looting and
pillaging, and executed Lord Say for encouraging literacy.
This provides the backdrop for the statement by Dick the Butcher, "The
first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers," to which Jack Cade
replies, "Nay, that I meant to do." Shakespeare adapted this statement
from Holingshed's Chronicles, where it is reported that John Ball exhorted
the people "that they might destroy first the great lords of the realm,
and after the judges and lawyers, questmongers, and all other whom they
took to be against the commons." Shakespeare's Stratford-on-Avon was not spared from the revolutionary
fervor and some local nobility were killed. Taken in context, Cade's men
sought not a utopia without lawyers (compare to Sir Thomas Moore's Utopia)
but rather to eliminate government and the rule of law. Thus Dick the
Butcher was a precursor to Sex Pistols.
Judges generally quote Dick the Butcher in two contexts: (1) when
criticizing the exclusion or limitation of lawyers from various
proceedings (always in dissenting opinions) and (2) when commenting on the
role of lawyers in society. Inevitably, judges making the first reference
are careful to note the complete context of the remarks, while judges in
the second category do not.
Perhaps the best example from the first context is Justice Stevens'
dissent in Walters v. National Association of Radiation Survivors.  473
U.S. 359 (1985).  The case involved a statute adopted in 1862 limiting
attorney's fees in veterans cases to $10.  The United States argued that
the system worked better without a lot of quarrelsome lawyers involved.  In dissent, Justice Stevens argued that, "Just as I disagree with the
present court's crabbed view of the concept of 'liberty,' so do I reject
its apparent unawareness of the function of the independent lawyer as a
guardian of our freedom."  Justice Stevens added a footnote, underscoring
his point:  "That function, however, was well understood by Jack Cade and
his followers, characters who are often forgotten and whose most
famous line is often misunderstood. Dick's statement ('The first thing we
do, let's kill all the lawyers') was spoken by a rebel, not a friend of
liberty. (citation omitted.) As a careful reading of that text will
reveal, Shakespeare insightfully realized that disposing of lawyers is a
step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government."  Thus,
Justice Stevens makes the point that lawyers are a protection from
government power rather than an evil to be protected against.
Other references are found in cases excluding attorneys from field
sobriety tests, excluding lawyers from line-ups and denying counsel to one
held as a material witness.

Hmmm.  I always thought the reason we went with AC was because at the

transfer DC power more than a half mile or so from the power plant, and
when trying to demonstrate it in NYC couldn't even get DC power all the

Tesla's AC power solved this problem, after which Edison and his backers

To put this in a broader and an historical perspective, let me point out that the government of the United States moved from the eloquent ideals and words of the Declaration of Independence, to a law that declared that any treasonable activity, including the publication of "any false, scandalous and malicious writing," was a high misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment, in just 22 years and 10 days.
By virtue of this legislation, twenty-five men, most of them editors of Republican newspapers, were arrested and their newspapers forced to shut down.(The Sedition Act, 1798, Section 2,  ). As the newspapers were shuttered, the 1st amendment was only 6 and a half years old.
I would submit for your consideration that governments of whatever stripe tenaciously and constantly move to expand the span and scope of their control, either with support of seemingly innocuous "stepping stone" laws, or by blatant disregard of law, precedent, or whatever else impedes that expansion. The most favorite tactic of those governments pretending western-style democracy is to implement secret, draconian controls and chilling surveillance to "protect the children" or "wage war on terrorism" or other real and imagined violent threats, over-hyped. The government uses the same pitch that comes from organized crime: "You want protection (security), you have to give up some money (freedom). You are either with us or against us. We cannot wait while dangers gather."
Want to put a couple hundred thousand US citizens in concentration camps because of their ancestry? The Supreme Court sees nothing in the constitution to interfere with that. The DOJ today is quite adept at actions which it holds to be immune from judicial review, so the inconvenience of a judicial rubber stamp is no longer needed. And you wonder if the government can require a licence to be a passenger on an airliner? They can require a license to leave your house on foot, and they are in the process of doing so. "Have papers? Proceed. No papers, oh, you are not under arrest, but we need to check into a few things. This will only take a couple of hours or so and then you'll be on your way (to the next checkpoint). It's for the children, you know?"
The first step will likely be for airline flight. With travel security papers, come to the airport 1 hour before departure. Without travel security papers, come to the airport 3 hours before Then we can expect to hear, "May I have your travel security number please?" You know the drill. In about 27 minutes, the credit information service companies will also have that number. It will be your license, revocable at will, to move about the country, to buy, to own, to lodge.
Has the president suspended the writ of habeas corpus? Sorry, that's secret, and since you asked, we must watch you carefully, because as our Attorney General says, civil liberties questions like that just give comfort to the enemy.
I know full well that a substantial percentage of readers sees this line of thinking as paranoia. I expect that percentage to drop rapidly.

Based on your inability or unwillingness to address the issues identified specifically, that is pretty good course of action on your part.
I would think you might be interested in going deeper, as "Blind signatures for untraceable payments" is directly applicable to both digital settlement and digital voting. See  for an interesting little article of introduction about the topic. And there are many others more current and deep.
Those issues, remaining unaddressed by you, include:
"The "sold vote" boogeyman".
You need to submit evidence that "anonymous" "internet" voting is more likely to be fraudulent than paper, voter-present by mail voting. You have submitted none, and the "cryptography" word is insufficient to scare me off.
The "bogus digital voter registration" boogeyman.
You may also wish to show how digital voter registration cards would be more likely to be bogus than "Motor Voter, no-id required" registration cards. Good luck.
The "crypto" boogeyman.
I challenge you to show that current, published crypto voting protocols cannot accomplish the 1. one digital sig, one vote, the first one, and the others are discarded
2. no dig signature, no vote
3. no dig voter registration, no dig sig
4. anonymity, i.e., no connectibility between the voter's choice and his identity.
5. auditability, i.e., connection between each voting "lever throw" and a dig sig for the current Next, the "internet" boogeyman.
It's just a pipe/wire/whatever. Bits. Don't be afraid. If the bits are properly signed, no problem and whether "internet" bits or voter-machine-punched-paper-tape-bits is irrelevant."

Choate, you DO say some interesting things sometimes*, but sometimes you come up with some real wacky crapola. This is one of them! PAM Dirac united quantum mechanics with relativity coming up with relativistic quantum mechanics. From this the existence of the positron was predicted.
If you still want to say there's some kind of "hole" in quantum theory, then are you saying that if we fix this hole, QM will bve able to predict experimental outcomes to, say 20 decimals rather than 10? (QM is by far the most sucesful physical theory ever developed.)
As for the other comments, they don't really have bearing on EPR. Remember, the E in EPR stands for Einstein, and it was he himself who predicted the bizarre and counter-to-all-rational-beliefs-about-physical-reality-type nature of quantum behavior. (Actually, he and Podolsky and Rosen put forth these arguments as proof that something was fundamentally flawed. He never guesed we'd actually SEE this stuff happen one day.) But my point is, if Einstein himself didn't see any reason to invoke relativity in this case, then its really not relevant.
No, relativity is not the 'hole' in EPR. Our understanding about the nature of physical reality is the hole. How does a photon "know" what another photon is doing instantaneously? (It doesn't matter 'as measured by who'...as long as ONE observer is able to see then communicate 'instantaneously', then we're no longer in territory that anybody really understands.)
Or if you want to weasel-word around this, then grapple with Ahranov-Bohm. How do the electrons "know" about the voltage of a removed zone? They have no connection with that zone whatsoever (unless you want to invoke the "Magentic Vector Potential", but then I guess its a complete coincidence that A-B accruately predicts the phenomenon...right?).

I actually have wanted to respond to some of your attempts to de-couple strong crypto from a need for certain political/ideological stances, but I haven't had the time. Suffice it to say, there's good reason for using strong crypto without necessarily supporting any single political ideology.

Hi, Tim,
I'm glad that you have a bout of lucidity.
The government essentially won the crypto battle, marginalizing crypto
proponents, quietly getting media and corporations under control when
crypto is concerned, and generally rising the stakes. Those of you who
have access to corporate product development documents that relate to
communications know what I am talking about. CALEA etcl. It's there,
it's real and I think that about 5-10% of development resources are
taken by it.
Most cypherpunks were relatively highly paid engineers with
comfortable lives and some time on their hands, so while crypto was
fashionable it was cool to hang out at meetings and have pipe dreams
about taking on the state. Even then, scum like del Torto started to
bank ahead and sell to the "freedom fighters" and "good cops".
But then it got much worse. After the WTC theater, being present at
essentially anti-state meetings was not considered totally benign. And
also the salaries were gone, so this beer and TV Saturday alternative
suddenly stopped being alternative at all.
So we're back to the fact that highly paid engineers in crypto field
are really not automatically revolutionaries. On the contrary.
There are very few in the general population that are cut to be true
dissenters and act upon it. Now this age brings in the additional
requirement: they have to also be decent engineers. As a result, there
are very few left.
