I never realised that the prefix "deca" was used in practise at all.
I've always learned it to be a prefix that exists only formally.
What country are you from?

Well, the original pgp 1.0 used MD4. When that was broken, it got replaced
by MD5. This does require the OpenPGP spec to be adapted of course. And in
the pgp 1 and 2 age, the web of trust was of course much smaller than it is
now, so it required less work.
That would be a more flexible approach than hardwiring a new hashalgo each
time the previous one was broken. Perhaps a reason to re-add the 1.0 way
of adding encryption and hash functions as dynamic loadable modules to the
main program?

How about SHA-256 and 512? Are they based on SHA-1? And how about
getting Tiger-192 back?

Dijkstra's goal of formally prooving entire programs more complicated
than hello world seems further away than ever. Don't loose any sleep
over it, noone even tried that in practice anyway.
