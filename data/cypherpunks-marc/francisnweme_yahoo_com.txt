@_subject: hello well wishers!!! 
Good Day Sir / Madam,  Complement of the season and how is everybody out
there!Do not be surprise with my strange kind of
letter for am doing what My mind ask me to do Before I
go on let me first of all explain myself to you. My
names are, Mr. Francis Nweme E. am 24 yrs old from
eastern Nigeria West Africa.Let me start by thanking
God who makes things possible for me to cope with
Hardship of things up to today and to be able to write
to a great men and women all over the world it is a
great privileged to me.I am the first son of my father
and mother although am never from a wealthy family but
I Now understand that having my own father around me
was more awesome than having my uncles around me. Not
until I lost my father in the year 1989 twelve yrs ago
When I was about 12 yrs old and was then in primary 6
life goes on but as a First son I refuse to give up my
mother to my uncle to marry as a second wife, B/c of
that I was maltreated and was also denied of my
fatherÂs properties.But as a little boy then, God
continue to lead me until when I was in secondary
three Things became very difficult to the extend that
I could not go ahead to finished up my education But I
still have joy that I can write even more than my
unclesÂ children who have finished there Secondary
education and I still have joy b/c my bible tells me
that it is only but a moment So I had to quite my
education charier due to the maltreat and the hardship
of thing I was passing through, I had to come To
Lagos, once a capital of Nigeria .my aim was to start
doing any thing to enable my mother and my Younger
ones feed b/c all eyes was on me to see how I can cope
with such situation.I came to Lagos with a very good
friend of mine who introduced me to one man and he
accepted me as a steward, that was 1996 and am still
with him up till now selling computer parts for him as
a marketer, But have not seen my noosing father and
mother that BIBLE reveals to me. Although I thank God
for all he has done to me at least those that were
laughing at me in sorrow have change their stile at
least I do send up to 1,000-naira equivalent to 10 us
dollars to my mother at home. Although the scripture
says we shall not beg I never believe that am begging
but What I called, looking for my noosing fathers and
mothers b/c according to the scripture He said he will
touch men and women to give unto us. Although am from
a country with all kind of corruption, looting, doping
and 419s I let those things go b/c it is evil and bad
Although they are making a lot of money through the
dirty deal looting people from the western World but
vanity upon vanity all in vanity for what will they
gain in this of their doping if one day They know they
are going to die and leave all those of their loot. Am
using this opportunity to preach Good news to you good
people of the world to never allow looters from
Nigeria and even from any were else to dope you. Pls.
let your friends hear my message even in the church or
mosque if possible. Am from a very dissent family I
choose to beg than to loot people.So my question now
is, are you my noosing father and mother? The reason
why I am begging for assistance is because I have a
very bright future with hope and knowledge to trade
but am financially handicap I need your help as much
as you can to enable me meet up to my need. Christmas
is around the corner my younger ones are looking up to
me for a Christmas cloths they donÂt know what am
passing through out here but they need their Christmas
cloths from me I let go my education to enable them go
on with their own I thank God non-out of four of them
have drop out of school since I step aside for them
Please good people of the world kindly assist me for
some money as much as you can I believe, to me nothing
is too small and God will restore to you all that you
have lost in The past including what you have in mind
to me in hundreds folds AMEN. Looking forward to hear from you with a tangible
response and God almighty will bless you more.
Have a nice day and god bless you all. Yours truly,
Francis Nweme E.                               Do You Yahoo!?
