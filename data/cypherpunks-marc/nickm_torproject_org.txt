The issue with padding isn't that it doesn't work at all, but that it
doesn't work well enough to do any good.  Last I checked, the state of
the art in low-volume padding could slow down correlation attacks by
10-50%, depending on how you're counting.
This sounds good until you think about how fast correlation attacks
actually are.  If a correlating attacker (one watching both ends of
the communication) needs only a second of traffic to link sender and
receiver, then forcing him to collect an extra half-second of traffic
doesn't actually help the user very much, assuming that the user
intends to use Tor for more than a second and a half.
What would need to change for padding to become useful? If it turns
out that correlation attacks are far more difficult than the research
community thinks, or if somebody comes up with a padding approach that
actually delays correlation enough[**], I think we should come back
to the question.
[*] You can do high-cost methods that defeat correlation[***] pretty
    easily: constant-rate traffic is one of them.  There's a FAQ
    entry about why constant-rate traffic probably won't work in
    the wild:
      [**] What's "enough"?  I'd say "the lifetime of a circuit," but I
      might be wrong.
[***] But you'd still need to worry about active attacks in this case.

Hi. Usually I try to keep it technical, since that's where I get my
biggest multiplier for effort-to-results, so you don't usually see me
talking about politics.  But this stuff here is really important.  So
far, it's been one among several things driving up my blood pressure
and making me lose sleep -- but if it passes, it may well be problem
number one.
So, please don't do just _one_ of the above.  Please help the EFF,
Fight for the Future, and/or whatever other groups opposing this bill
you are comfortable with.  Learn what it involves, and why it's a
danger for free speech in the US. Sign petitions.  Get involved.  And
if you're a US person, please ALSO call your representatives.  I've
called mine, and I hope you will too.  Learn about the bill first, so
you have something cogent to say, and remember to be polite.
This one matters.
getting back to software soon I hope,
