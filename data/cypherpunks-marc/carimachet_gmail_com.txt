i have spoken exstensively to lawyers about using this tactic
they say it is very problematic > the people that sit on juries are
not informed that they can in fact nullify AND if a lawyer sees a
possibility in an instance of a case they can get at best reprimanded
by the judge if there is any 'jury tampering' perceived
the courts have nullified the jury nullification law
if the citizenry were in fact knowledgable and educated that would
help the issue and change a lot of things actually - the education
system sucks of course so... and its such an odd thing because people
put such incredible "faith" in the legal system and they know so
little about how it "functions"
i have done some work in the jail/court support area and there are a

i am not claiming natives to b beyond perfection > my point was they
had a different relationship to "owning" and i reflect that mindset
two of my great grandmothers were native one blackfoot one cherokee
and you are not the first to be dismissive of my blood and wont be the
last i find it sad
the blackfoot hunted buffalo heres what happened with that (hint:
white ppl ordered them killed in mass)
the blackfoot moved entirely to canada where they are today trying to
retain their history and memories thru retaining their language
re ownership some say if the french would have confronted the issue in
their revolution mankind would be a bit further down the road - it
isnt an easy task by far but worth discussing
re chief seattle - stories i heard while living in seattle were that
natives could not even walk on the same sidewalk as a white person and
their right to fish was taken from them (this is still an issue) > how
does that ad up in your world of individual ownership rights?

this may explain a little more
yes "white terminology" holds white CONCEPTS as do words in my tribe
the blackfoot and other tribes languages i am also cherokee for
instance the word "floor" does not exist because things are noted as
actions so it is "flooring" because things are not stagnant they are
active > everything is animated there are no inanimate and animate
objects all are animate
you may hear people say the whites 'stole' the land but what they did
was move the people ... kill them etc they did not live in concert etc
'indians' lived > very different
i am not sure mayb make an argument as to why it is different
i know of these instances yes but the land was vast so ... they moved
on ... no i dont think they saw it as particularly 'ok' and they made
confederacies and agreements regarding these issues - they had
community agreements which they worked together to come to also fyi
they had chiefs yes but they had different councils that made
decisions they still function in this way and what your role was was
what you were naturally good at  - they didnt try to make people into
something they were not
thats what we have now with neo liberal capitalism
i meant physical production too - i mean do you understand how many
hundreds of years it took life to come up with the spoon > just a
spoon that took a ton of time and energy and really i see myself as no
different than a spoon
i never said that i think in terms of co-creativity
no i was extending and making an argument > but how do you think you
"own" yourself?
BUT what about the tomato plant it took more "trouble" than u i would
say - in ur world does it have "ownership"
F no and i dont think there was a big bang either or a beginning i
think life is a spiral cone time and space are - i dont think time is
linear see deleuze and guattari > but native americans think like that
i think property is a coffin
BUT i understand what you mean how it could be seen that way actually
it really is a multidimensional issue but overall i see that history -
and my own inner gut - shows that having community is a more fully
effective way of living than individualism BUT also i think rulers
will turn anything they can into something fucked up
yes that was my point those are the people that are so interested in
property rights > hey ya know the largest land owner in manhattan ??
catholic church... know the second largest property owner in manhattan
?? episcopal church ... what i think they have socially engineered is
the protection of ruling class property rights and convinced the
people it serves them - it does not !! otherwise everyone would have
food and clean water and a place to live (its not that much to ask
for) really it doesnt serve humanity or life force either to have such
levels of separation between ppl because of who they were born to,
where etc

if u really want to know what i think then u need to know my thought
processies are not like "white" ppl > ideas of ownership are foreign
to me i am native american and most tribes though they lived in areas
didnt consider ownership of them but a co-creative partnership - re:
food > when my people hunted buffalo in the plains they didnt just
indiscriminately kill buffalo they weeded the herd and were mindful to
examine how they could be of help to the herd it was only intelligent
to do so as it kept their source of food and clothing healthy and
vibrant but also it was respectful of life
so there are people that give food away for free right now today > why
would they do that?
well i think ideas are in the air and we build on the shoulders of
giants so production is owed down thru the ages and i think there isnt
really a you basically > your first form i would say is life itself
and you are made mostly of water and some minerals (dirt) and when you
'die' your body dissipates like a cloud - i dont think 'you' die i
think you just transform
so there is no 'you' to have ownership > would you say life owns life
? that would be odd > i think ownership is an illusion i also think
you didnt make yourself so that would be a glitch in your argument > i
mean i think you had a bit to say in the matter but we are very
limited mathematical concoctions (gorgeously made and amazing but
limited) we cant presently manufacture ourselves in order to "own"
ourselves but even then we wouldnt be independent of life itself so
... > maybe in future we will manufacture ourselves but there is
probably going to be a divisive factor in the manufacturing of life
forms (divisive as in schism - not workin so good - should be
interesting but already happening w/ monsanto actually so...)
i think the idea of ownership was made by rulers (seen thru millenia
but look at the magna carta which will be 800 in 2015) i want as
little to do with rulers thought patterns and functioning as possible

all hail to the chiefs but happy to praise all-all but look even mass
murderers are kind sometimes i am sure ie just onaccounta' you is
smart in one compartmentalized section of ur life dont mean ur
emotionally smart
i have not heard this before - i had the information that he was
downloading way too much at a time and doing it over a very small
period of time and that tipped them off my information is that he was
very careful in other work of this kind why would he b so sloppy this
time - i mean how do you know he knew they were on to him?
yes but i think from my understanding it wasnt the amount of prison
time or the money but the fact that he wld have to plead guilty to 13
felony counts - he would not get to serve in the government ... vote
AGREED - i am not sure ppl know enough about his case any ideas about
how we can push it out there more?????
i would love to see the rankings on that too i was just going over
this very thing > there is no oversight absolutely NONE like in the
bureau of prisons guess who decided the fate of lynne stewart > 1 man

curious that u compare US judicial system to russia thats funny
agreed the system is not reliably predictable EVER i think he spoke to
agents without a lawyer present
i think all instances are multifaceted and criticism and debate about
aaron is helpful i wasnt saying that i was saying the militance was
off to me
i would be interested to hear more of what ppl think were the
mis-steps in his work however large or small it may seem - as i am
doing some work around 'reparations' and want the full picture as much
as possible before i get hit in the face with it somewhere else...

i actually use these ways of writing on purpose - i think language is alive
and it changes like you and i - so i see the future english language use as
different than now but i use some of its aspects now such as the use of
numbers in words etc - if you have seen any future depictions of written
language it is usually full of symbols letters and numbers (like code) -
even just squares - i just try to open pathways for such things in
different arenas and i dont see things as 'real' or unreal in the way that
you do

its the shac7 case
there were convictions on stalking that were not illegal at the time of the incidents - thats my information from one of the defendants anyway and other laws were never utilized in such a way in order to convict activists or anyone  - one law that was over 10 years old was used that had never been utilized in any case and even the name of the law was changed before the case was brought
the problem with these kinds of cases is that they set precedent and no one knows about it AND the defendants rarely have the cash to properly fight the case so the system of law becomes flawed - broken

'Many are also asking more strongly than ever: "Is international law still

further to try to resolve some of the questions of how and where it applies.
One debate in the new wild west of cyberwarfare law is between two schools

incredibly different and majorly egalitarian (no state rule whatsoever
autocratic or otherwise)
i dont think in a dualist manner either communism or capitalism there are
different ways
proudon dealt a lot with the issue of property which is an incredibly
difficult issue to deal with and some say if the french during the
revolution would have dealt solidly with the issue of property (a giant
problem because of the elite) there would have been a much more transformed
world after and a 'real' revolution

the very idea of scarcity is a con game the elite and the autocrats feed
everyone fr before they are born so that they can exploit them
i find the houses that look like restaurants or hotels that i have seen in

that shows how little you know about it for you to think of it on such

factions so...
your not an anarchist
what was your little 'foray' - so french - do tell 1902 chicago?
for your information i am a provocateur that you cannot see that again
exclaims your lack of knowledge/care
its not just about the state - there are very different types of anarchists
- that is part of the quality of it all the form is open - its like the
concept of opensource
you are right to a degree it is about personal freedom but that still
frames as against the state so i would say it is more about not imposing
your will on others instead wanting others to be authentically themselves
and 'believe' it or not that has a lot to do with optimal production - each
person has a quality like no other ...
because some people have qualities that are harmful to others of course
there are huge issues of justice within this model and often we are asked
about justice - a lot of the community thinks on the level of restorative
justice which has models in pockets of society all over the world - one
example is in ecuador - the natives have a different form of justice when a
crime is committed the gov police are called but then the decision is made
with the community what will happen next - will the perp be taken to the
government justice system or will the community deal with them - if the
community deals with them then they will be asked to perform certain tasks
in the community to make up for their misdeeds - some even think it is a
good idea for the person to come up with the tasks themselves...
look up direct democracy - there is often within our model questions
regarding scalability that is often where the rubber meets the road for
people - we dont know how that works exactly as it is not been sent into
praxis enough but we have developed spokes councils and what happens is
rotation of all aspects - all members are rotated so that it is not
representative - now zizek has complained about our model that he doesnt
want to participate in this kind of constant meetings he doesnt want to
deal with other stuff besides his scholarly intellectual stuff ... i dont
think it is a problem no one is forced to be a part - there is just no
exclusion - inclusion is not mandated - so zizek is kinda not knowledgable
there - what i really like is that people that work in say sanitation do a
report back about what is going on to everyone and people that work in say
media can be knowledgeable about what is happening in that field (there can
be people that actually work in both fields of couse) but then the people
in the field of media can be alerted if there is something they can do to
help the field of sanitation in some way - get information out about that
they need help with this project etc... information flow ....
anyway i dont want to write a book here mayb listen to this - yes theres a
big star and david graeber capitalist but it has real info too
particularly i would point you to the theories of proudhon, bakunin and
 >> capitalism is an economic model that has severe ramifications
i call it capitalism
when the assistant attorney general of the united states says they made a
decision not to try to convict the banks of fraud because there would be an
economic hit to the u$ of a ... that is capitalism in praxis today

A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.
Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for
individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a
totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct
business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True
Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be
untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and
tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly
perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central
importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of
today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government
regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the
ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust
and reputation.
The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and
economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods
are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof
systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication,
and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in
Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security
Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers
attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the
next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas
economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks,
ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters,
multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development
will be some of the enabling technologies.
The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology,
citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers
and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these
concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be
trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An
anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for
assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be
active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto
Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic
methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government
interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information
markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all
material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly
minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast
ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property
rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out
of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which
dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

of the war - that there must be some valid basis to the claim that Saddam
posed a threat. My basic trust in these institutions neutralized the
objections I had and led me to passively acquiesce to what was being done
("I believed then that the president was entitled to have his national
security judgment deferred to, and to the extent that I was able to develop
a definitive view, I accepted his judgment that American security really
would be enhanced by the invasion of this sovereign country.").'

i dont remember ever a journalist putting themselves in a shot like that

out of the abstract cerebral place - that it isnt actually in in the first
place - dead bodies in mogadishu or the moon are not abstract or just
floaty... not in my head at least not in my gut either or my big toe
jeremy is from wisconsin i think is that what you think brings context?
please you will have to bring more to the table than that... i am not
listen i am all for showing a lot of stuff truelly really i am... but if
you are on the ground as a journo you run across things that are just not
ok to even film - its just like that
i have other things as i originally posted that make all of this much worse
for me > jeremy attacked mona eltahawy on twitter over her media 'junkets'
in new york regarding the revolution in egypt he was really fucked up in
doing it and i was like after that questioning his ethics then i saw this
scene and i was like wtf

soldiers sign up to be filmed as far as i am concerned they have sold

think it relates to this argument - i think soldiers should always be
filmed like the cops because i think the role they play is super psychotic
- maybe if the images of them and what they are doing were distributed more
it would be helpful
i think it would have been ethical for scahill to film the dead body in the
morgue - it would be great if they had the permission of the family but...
its that he was in the frame thats really my big problem

could it possible be that the story matters more than the filmmaker - ya
think maybe ? maybe possibly ?
plus your 'proposiition' is not evidence - its no excuse for him exploiting
a dead body anyway
people when you are an ethical journalist you are careful not to exploit
images of children, people that are unconscious etc as they do not have a
say in the image content - if this is breeched it is possible they are
being exploited but to then place oneself in the frame is just beyond all

horror > aaargghhh is there a race i can call pirate? maybe the turks...
they were the barbary pirates i think ...ottomans
yes it is culture but it is also my dna ... my computer is not a microsoft
computer and that is just that... it might have little gui's of microsoft
but NO not microsoft ...i am racist against microsoft ...because native
american or indigenous were slaughtered in mass in more ways than just
their bodies and they still are and we have political prisoners and yes we
say 'we' when we are together and some tribes are deemed with this kind of
characteristic others not etc language structures are similar though ... it
is very different to be indigenous and just denial of indigenousness is a
defacement its part of the horror as the whites that took the native
american babies away from their families wanting to erase the native
american in them
so how can we have our dna respected and not be racists ?
so bringing it back to all things cypher is it possible to get these
turkish docs unredacted - have they made it illegal to unredact shit - i
think they have - i think i read it somewhere ? wheres hitler been lately?
o am i being racist against germans? lets make u a new word ..how bout
'culturist' ... 'you are a culturist' ... no that doesnt sound right
docs are all about the terrorist kurds you know - a race of people - and we
are fucked by laura poitras again what fucking explanation can she have for
these massive redactions
turkey just wants everyone to be turks cathal
the keyword option wasnt given to the turks then... i wonder if they have
it now? maybe they hacked the american code and made it possible if the
fuckers wouldnt give it to them

define racism then cause i dont think we have the same definition really
also maybe we dont have the same definition of trolling
just saying someone is a race and is fucked up with power based on their
racial privilege is not racism
its like saying someones race and then being called a racist because you
categorized someone within their race
have we been socially engineered as racist and genderist and specieist and
ageist and mentally or physically challengedists - oh yes and we need to
build new frames out of it but you saying i am white and racist against my
"own" people because i hate the culture doesnt do that - if you really want
to do something about it have a really long think about designing new
frames... raise consciousness - make new words develop your own mind
which tribe?
not a club
are you being racist by deciding my identity for me ?... i dont identify as
white ... i dont act white ... its like i am a tansgender person that
identifies as a woman and you are telling me i am just a man and i have to
just face that ... you dont get to decide for me what i identify with
its really white of you to think you get to decide for me btw
power bullshit ... very white capitalist behavior
is the first step to fixing it...
race and dont understand that other people love zion - do you love zion?
in general?  The state of Israel?
personally met have been nice to me, and I've gotten along well with them.
Draw your own conclusions.
conclusion - you dont know anything about zion
umn fuck gods please read nietzsche - wrote in the 1800's
ethics has nothing to do with law ... guess you havent noticed
us of fucking a beyond privileged compared to the people that dont have
potable water on the planet
I agree, massive ongoing public investment in water infrastructure sure is
a nice thing!  But most people on the planet do have potable water to
drink, tho perhaps not as plentifully as in America.  Not that many people
worldwide are literally dying of thirst.
umn talking people that dont have a tap to have fucking water in so... but
here i cannot drink the tap water maybe more common than you know
that are the others that dont have the right to even learn to read
America ya call "the flyover" is chock full o' people with horrific

i am french yes and some irish and NATIVE AMERICAN which means i super dont
like white fuckers that killed my people en mass and did a lot of other
horrible things to them in the name of capitalism so
i am black foot and cherokee and my character seems to align more with that
part of my dna a lot of the time ... yes sometimes i am a dumb white fuck
but thats the nature of the beast but mostly i behave not like a white
person that smiles and nods and stays silent out of fear... i cant exist
that way... i am just a 'wild indian' some other racists have said... they
were white people of course
i am very racist against white empirical capitalist and while i know native
americans that suck - other races have people that suck of course but white
people are really oppressive in my mind so i call them out for it
some people have told me it is racist to claim my heritage of being native
american ... a cop in berlin said 'hile hitler' to me when i told him i was
native american but i guess i should be grateful he actually believed i was
native american - some people dont
i really despise zion because of their fascism and mass murder based on
race and dont understand that other people love zion - do you love zion?
i know me engaging the frame of racism is fucked up but it is so beyond any
comprehension that whites have so much and others have so little
maybe we can work together to figure out wording that points out that they
are white without it being racists??? cause ya know they are like white
so... no i guess it doesnt work... should we ignore their oppressive race?
how... they are all over everything all the time nodding smiling acting
calm even in the face of mass murder
your little axiom about privilege wouldnt hold up in an ethical court ...
wow i will tell my mother someone said i am from a privileged background
she will rofl for days... i am privileged... isnt everyone from the great
state of imperialist fuckers known as the us of fucking a beyond privileged
compared to the people that dont have potable water on the planet and the
people that dont have enough food on the planet and the people that are the

i dont see it as poetry or emotion i see it as logic but prove logic to be
lacking poetry or emotion empirically/logically
these kinds of degrading segregations or silos of thought are also
christian in my mind which in turn for me is capitalist like in an
anti-enlightenment kind of way ie logic good emotion or instinct bad
instinct is really important to understand like in the tsunami that hit
thailand remember ? Animals didnt really die en mass as they knew it was
coming so they got out of dodge as they say ... did they have a gauge that
told them to get the fuck out sure they are closer to life so they can
sense it better or they got a signal in some form .... sound probably its
really logical actually but why didnt oh so logical humans get the same
ethics are not emotional by nature - really ethics are logical we may get
hints that something doesnt feel right in our gut but then i think it can
be logically laid out as to why as well : murder isnt just emotional there
are lots of factual ramifications that follow from the murder as i am
native american and basically my family was murdered by the fake USG i can
first person talk about the logical ramifications of my family not being
allowed to exist
please prove your point about `lateral thinking` which i would term
horizontality ... if it isnt effective in a given space i often have seen
that the structures that are monolithic are why so i would be interested to
see any other formulations ... as i am a problem seeker ...uuuuhhh then i
know where to work
i think we agree that ideology is not functional but i am not sure we see
the same problems to solve ... i am not sure there is a clear understanding
that life is being heavily designed by a 'few' people in power and they are
designing it for many years to come like they have plans and shit so...
somehow i dont think the plans include medicine for the sick or literacy
for everyone... lets not even discuss food and water or combating mass
murder of the planets inhabitants
heres a video about what people often section off as logic and emotional or
creative sides of the brain ... our own interfaces should be looked at as
evidence not only because of their structures information but to show our
limited scope and not just thru our form but thru the
manipulation/propaganda about our form/forms which you seem to be driving
i think in order to make the machines of the future - like the ones that
will decide on their own wether to kill you or not in a battle - then this

its religious thought to even utilize the word 'evil' let alone think in
those terms and religious thought is a capitalist parasite >>> read
nietzsche for fuck sake he wrote in the 1800's
one of my arguments is that it is structurally unsound to rely on one
method >>> especially if built by your enemy - i look to nature as other
thinkers do/have and i think about buckminster fuller - his analysis of
panther dna making them vulnerable to extinction because it is all so/too
similar ... in any given situation i do not think in terms of one solution
... i have used this analogy before ... sperm: there are lots of them in
one load ... they all race to get to the egg sure but, they actually help
each other to penetrate - they dont care who gets in as long as one of them
transforms the egg into a being (i mean i cant really speak for sperms in
general but it has been analysed like this)... thats their job ...they even
have been seen to help each other non-competative like :: this is the kind
of structures we need moreso not monolithic structures that blind us ...
its really a geometry problem for me... math
but also it is all ethical to me as well : if my family was murdered by a
fucker i wouldnt go and use that fuckers infrastructure cause they made it
for me to use and sent some other fuckers around the globe selling it cause
like the fucker murdered my family i wont support them in any way ever
....why would i talk myself into supporting the murderer of my family when

i think there could be solutions utilized like easily shifting the ip
address of comp and router yourself in your own little hut > 'ghost' it but
not thru others .... pretty fucking simple i know but maybe effective in a
really different way than having the fake government of the US build
something and use people that are activists against them to make it work
also i think the infrastructure is too bulky
i like to think about satelites (and thats all i will say about that) - i
dont know i would have to have a real think about solutions it is very
important to think about it and not just the problem for sure but i dont
think the methodology of tor is a solution i think it is a stoppage point
that people are not seeing beyond ... people dont think it has been
penetrated and i have no proof of that but maybe that isnt the main problem
for me ... structurally speaking it is a disaster ... the masses being
handed a tool in order to subvert the government??? as they say you cant
make this shit up
i know that when i was in syria i could get a fucking video call in the
desert where there was nothing ... this was syria not a rich country per
say like at all so i think the choking of the communication system is super
in play ... if others dont think thats a problem then they need to educate
themselves ... do people that live in the US on this list even know that
the infrastructure of fiber optics that underlies the communications may
not even be utilized in their city and that the reason it is not used is
because the communication companies bought a contract with there city that
freezes it all up? please look into the chatanooga model if you dont know
about this 'freemarket' bullshit>>>> also fyi iraq had video calls
nationwide in 2000 or even before ... now i am not sure what tech they were
using i think radiowaves and shooting the signal over land that way but it
all points to a tremendous shut down of functionality  .... not that it was
probably all that healthy for people but...
sure we can write each other little words on this frame of communications
but see what happens when attempting to shift in a large way ... like when
they printed the 3d gun... people had to git fr USA & like when barrett
made project pm and this is a major reason i think there should be as many
solutions as possible not just one - not as easy for gov/corp to take them

you are criticising their depth and this is as deep as you go?
so to answer your question about details of day to day ops they do
EVERYTHING - define everything as 'interests' of the nation and its all
determined by the executive branch - congress has information - supposedly
controls the purse but watery issue and the courts are not involved at all
especially with foreign issues because the law in the US is based on
precedent and some supreme court set stated that the executive branch is
the 'sole organ of foreign affairs'
what are their tech capabilities? everything they can get their hands on
so work on everything and that will be your best stab at defence
i am being rude here but my point is that if we are always just trying to
put out fires of the power people then what is really being built
and it is a soap opera theatre piece ... very engaging saga ... if it is
disengaged from then what does that look like?
what did he do - he worked on what was in front of him

and this has a lot of information that conveys what to do & even how to do
it - its not completely accurate (as she has limited frames to convey the

I dont know-know but test it all out irl ask someone in love with you if
you can fuck them ...watch the facial expression
Steve could be wrong as steve was wrong about that upper eschelon no say
I am an artist and have worked with whats considered high level artists ...
say fuck more than me which seems impossible and these kind of caste
distinctions of words or body functions seem to slap in the face the life
of language
Well known thinkers and artists minds dont wotk overall in these
hierarchies ... exclusionary breaks of fenced off condemnation ... spaces
of life - all of them - are expressionable and loved which is actually very
difficult in having no good and bad no good and evil is a complexity the
western mind - christian mind finds hard to bare
Where can they put the control valves and buttons to press if there are no
societal goods and evils as if mass stupidity is the overall normative of
each and everyone needs instriction booklets with their bodies
I like that maybe both realities are acknowledged - saying fuck or mother
fucker is now considered a right  - to be upheld like other rights and
maybe also at the same time a degradation of women or love

I do agree with steve that the use of the word fuck is a exploitation or
degradation of sex/love which is not that great
We need new words
There have been psyche tests on using swear words ... that is benificial to
the psyche as a sort of release ... some fri3nds of mine that are autistic
find using them to be really helpful but which words using is important
I have 2 friends that had a giant fight about this very thing - one woman
was dutch one american - the dutch hated that the new yorker said fuck and
the new yorker hated and argued against the dutch woman using the word cunt
- which is very common in dutch culture - the giant fight was the demise of
their friendship
The dutch stated using fuck was degrading to love
The new yorker stated using cunt was degrading to women
The dutch said degrading love was far worse than degrading women

So anarchists in fucking spain took up tanks ... and palestine ... buchunin
organized serious shit  -not sure if the human race is all that actually
so... being an anti speciest and anti-anthropocentric i dont really see the
level diffrrentiation as much as others
I am totally clear that i can not engage empathy if i have such judgements
about armed struggle to call it counter revolutionary ... should the
spanish had committed mass suicide ... should the palestinians ? Math is a
factor we only have so many functionalities to work with and until these
functionalities are expanded more thru serious fucking profound massive
work it cannot be different
People are working to expand functionalities now and doing amazing work but
there are many ways to dismantle the state i cannot shove one way into
oblivion in my mind because i dont know everything so... each frame is
different and to me respecting anothers frame is fucking anarchism and
without the respect of the other aspect anarchy would be too weak or what
would it even be?

protection of community is a different mindset but yay you can have the
blood thirsty murder lover fucker there too of course
state dont like check points by community ... UK use to do shootings at
community checkpoints and pretend they were a protestant or vis versa a
catholic just to fuck with the community security effect
all of this points to why i think there needs to be many theories developed
around solution in all sectors of society not just one base theory to solve
one issue then we are all good and we live in nirvana.... work on
everything you can all the time
work on mindset ... so restorative justice is like that it tears at the
underlying mindset of getting off on murder and blood lust... mediation
shit ...calling out people that take power instead of standing there mouth
open drooling
this is being taught now in primary schools

also the dude is just replacing the state with capitalism and anarcho
capitalism is bullshit anarchy is against any that is any any any structure
impossing its structure on the people and fucking capitalism is a structure
so anarco capitalists should rename themselves
the dude talks about that the community the community would not allow this
or that if someone stole your tv the community would not allow you to just
go in the dudes hut and take it back - you need an intermediary ... but
this is monolithic thinking ... which is a pit in theories ... they
strangle themselves with coffinesque solutions instead of being base theory
so fucking blackwater has been doing this shit for a while now ... gun for
hire and what i am not reading here is any consciousness that the
murder/war zone is a fucking hopped up place the people that perform these
actions are getting off on
i found the place for you where he says combat is like no other drug jim so
you dont have to listen to everything
so some people get off on the murder
but we have to already know that
the idea behind dropping the bombs on japan was like this deterrent or that
is what generally american people think anyway ... the japanese would not
give an unconditional surrender yet they had surrendered
all these mass murder desires need to be shifted out as i think they are
strong entities in and of themselves apart from money the psyche is
straight up blood lust blood thirsty fucks ... why we have blood thirsty
fucks everywhere ??? why do people get off on murder/war like it is a drug
? until these mindsets are twisted out of themselves and drained of energy
clear theory of crowd sourced assassination for deterrent cannot fully
work... if it was like one or two crazy fucks that desired combat and
murder to get off then that would be one thing but this is like a lot of
fucks and even the fucking american psyche associations enjoy hurting
there are many fronts to work on all at the same time to shift out of all
of this

i will look at that
but what makes wired less "chatty"
can you expand your ideas on why wireless over wired/fiber?
if the interconnected reach problem goes away that is
my issue with wire/fiber is that it is infrastructure built by the powers
... if higher levels of strength are on wireless networks - which my report
discusses as coming - then maybe it is a better place to form new structures
the powers have proven they will lock them for capital as the chatanooga
model demonstrates so i think it would be best to move from wire
and my point in bringing up syria and iraq wireless use as v strong signal
in the middle of nowhere speaks to wireless ability as well so
i have no clue how they attianed this super connectivity and maybe the
human body was sort of fucked by the waves floating in the air but still
... there could be built protection shields

also to my knowledge his archive is there but the USG confiscated his US
archive and it was freed in 2013 but i have not looked into that
declasification from top secret ... to what i dont know...
there are problems with the digitization process
some fbi files are linked here:
anyway the point of bringing it up is that in spite of the powers making
structural decisions for the globe i still think it is possible to work
around them
and i am not sure this original post of johns is really that interesting
to what point is he posting it? knowns?
there is overall a harnessing of the structures in the minds of people
meant to thwart development and all fronts need work to shift this out >

i wrote about the chatanooga model that freed the fiber under the city of
chatanooga and also the future being wireless hubs not broadband ... look
to what the powers are making frameworks for and develop outside that realm
using its flaws
when i lived in syria i had video calls in the middle of the desert ... no
cell towers in sight -
iraqis had video calling in 2000 or even 1999 - anyone that had an
efficient fone (nokia was big)

From the code analyst:
Embedded in Galileo code 'pedoporn' 'childporn avi'
One idea - considering hacking team w/FBI and DEA, you can embed that code
to give the appearance that the flagged target is under surveillance for
child porn but since there is already an FBI flag for that, it's a lie.
It's a mask to hide that your surveilling someone but you have no
legitimate legal reason to do it.
a 'childporn.avi' - is a profile pic like an 'avatar' that flags the person
as in a child porn ring but hacking team doesn't do 'rings' - they do
targeted (activists, dissidents etc) surveillance. So that's off and since
it's embedded "placed over the source code" - the LEA is using it to mask
the real reason they are spying on this person
LEA likes to use child porn as a 'plant' - it's like an old school cop
'planting' cocaine on someone they've violated.

there are numerous types of anarchy
one has direct democracy > horizontality as a formulation like in
its a process (like life is a build so is the anarchic form) and the
hierarchical forms of government are eroded by its functionality
we made formulations for assemblies and developed new methods within
different geographies for structure > new structure for decision making >
there are many actions within the erosion process one is participatory
budgeting >>>> most sectors can have actions in this way

anything by bakunin but also read about his life
he opposed socialism because of its statism > authoritarianism
the internet archive has a section on him
he wrote some but worked on the front lines as well so had a high education

Quantum Entanglement & Spooky Action at a Distance
Published on Jan 12, 2015
Does quantum entanglement make faster-than-light communication possible?
What is NOT random? First, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking
the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over
six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum
entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by
professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with
two of them).
Does hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If
it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden
variables must update faster than light - they would be considered
'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you
make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist
and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get
opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be
conserved in the universe.
Everyone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be
transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator
could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of
measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability
of up/down.

so interesting thread on crypto
---------- Forwarded message ----------
You're wrong.
Existing solutions for the Byzantine Generals Problem provide for any
two correctly functioning nodes to reach agreement regardless of what
any or all other nodes do.  Sybil attacks do not affect the correctness
of the solution.
The problem with them is that required bandwidth per peer scale with the
square of the total number of all other peers.  And sybil attacks DO
affect the scale of the problem for bandwidth purposes.
With block chains the required bandwidth per peer scales linearly with
the number of all other peers (well, technically with the size of the
transactions done by all other peers), making it more scalable (but
still not scalable to the level of a widely used payment network).
The "Lightning Network" solves a problem for people who do many
transactions per day with each other.  There is no merchant nor client
with whom I do more than one transaction per day, so absolutely none of
my transactions would wind up using it.  I expect it to have some real
impact on the bandwidth and size of the block chain because some
business models are absolutely pathological in terms of number of
transactions per day by individual customers (like casinos or
speculative markets) but not nearly as much as its proponents hope
because it simply isn't applicable to ordinary tx (like grocery
stores, office supply vendors, restaurants, or investment markets).
And it still doesn't solve the problem that Trusted parties have emerged
in the form of online wallets and exchanges etc, and they are failing
and/or goxxing people on a regular basis.
Multimillion dollar losses, thefts, and swindles impose public as well
as private expense.  Legislators, Law enforcers, and civil courts cannot
ignore them because the people who get goxxed when they happen won't
allow them to.  Legislation, law enforcement, and both civil and
criminal prosecutions in court are damned expensive, and will
accordingly attract taxation and regulation as the taxpayers
underwriting that expense use their governments to seek to limit their
Being a self-sufficient or self-regulating system does not include
placing fiscal burdens on the public without taxation. Nor does it
include freeloading on public law enforcement, legislative, and judicial
resources without regulation.

        Who - the fuck - is we. My message was addressed to grarpamp. I
        bet he didn't read it in real time.
        Because an absurdist like you says so.
        Exactly what a US establishment puppet woud say.
        So let's see :
        1992 :
        "Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability
        for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with
        each other in a totally anonymous manner. "
        I wonder if Tim May is embarrased at having mande such a
        blatantly wrong predicion.
        " Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive
        re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which
        implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance
        against any tampering."
        Where are such networks operating?
        What we do have is completely sabotaged hardware courtesy of
        Intel Inc, a criminal organization that May had something to
        do, I believe.
        Oh...
        Sure. It's especially important that the political 'mistakes' of
        the american nazis be completely 'ignored'.
