For whatever reason these ladies want to cheat on their husbands
Content is health to the sick and riches to the poor. Have fun,
A fool in a gown is none the wiser. All things come to those that wait. . Wise it is to comprehend the whole. . Make hay while the sun shines. . Flattery is all right so long as you don't inhale. .
The love of money is the root of all evil. Experience is the best teacher. no more?
.An idle man is the devil's playfellow. . He that pays last never pays twice. . Fresh as a daisy. .
Hasty climbers have sudden falls. . Beauty is but skin deep. . Live and learn. .
It is better to stay silent and be thought a fool, than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt. . Appearances are deceptive. . He who sings drives away sorrow. .
