Please do run as many servers as you can afford. There is absolutely no privacy issue if you set the MyFamily option. Note that you must remember to set it on all the servers for it to work (so I can't just claim 99% of the Tor-network is my family and therefore you should use my 1% remaining evil servers by setting the option in one config file).
There is no issue with you running 100 servers as long as you use MyFamily, that would be very good. It's only when you're running 100 servers on different /16's and pretend that you have no involvement with any of them that I would wonder what you're up to..
