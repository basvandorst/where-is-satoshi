Hello Everyone!
For those that are using secure XMPP clients (Jitsi and the like) I'd
like to announce two new Prosody servers. Both are located in the
Netherlands and are available for public use. If you would like to try
them out they are located at chat.jpunix.net and chat.cpunk.us. Both
are fully-featured. Give them a try if you're so inclined!
