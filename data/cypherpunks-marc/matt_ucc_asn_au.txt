As a small data point, I'd use it. At first boot a SSH
server could slowly poll the ioctl in the background until
it's ready, then generate host keys. Saves having a delay on
first connection which will lead to mystified users.
I don't know if it would get used at a system level - for
upstart/systemd/whatever they'd probably prefer something
they wait for asynchronously?
Of course the systems that most need it probably won't get a
bleeding edge kernel for quite a while :-\
