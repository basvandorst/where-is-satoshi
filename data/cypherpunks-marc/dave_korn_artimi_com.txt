  I thought the bit about "Set $wgLogo to the URL path to your own logo
image" was quite funny.  But they did misspell 'teh' in "Transparent
end-to-end encryption for teh internets".
  It does sound a lot like "SSL/TLS without certs", ie. SSL/TLSweakened to
make it vulnerable to MitM.  Then again, if no Joe Punter ever knows the
difference between a real and spoofed cert, we're pretty much in the same
situation anyway.
  And of course those supposedly transparent fails-and-reconnects will turn
out to be anything but, in practice...
