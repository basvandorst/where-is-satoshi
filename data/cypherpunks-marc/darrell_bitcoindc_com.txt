Would you be up for sharing what you want Ethereum to do?
Yes, I too wonder if these behemoth's realize they are likely supporting
their very undoing by supporting Ethereum.
I very much want to see decentralization happen, and allow each of us to be
sovereign individuals, that align briefly with one another as needed   to
make stuff happen that corporations currently do, rather than large
structures with concentrated power.
