While smart, most providers make an assumption at least with a piece of
dark fiber the only people with access to it are themselves and any
providers of the fiber.  I don't think that's an unrealistic
expectation... Providers who have trenched their own fiber certainly do
not encrypt traffic across the network, but their fiber is probably no
less susceptible to tapping at certain locations.  There have been a
number of articles in recent years about how vulnerable the fiber
infrastructure is to attacks, tapping, etc.  Vaults, manhole locations,
etc. are pretty much wide open.
