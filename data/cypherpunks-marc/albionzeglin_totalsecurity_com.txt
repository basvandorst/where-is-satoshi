There are consumer protection laws that may be used to open this up.
Manufacturers are required to provide for repair parts for a minimum amount of time.  Being able to take your car to an independent repair
services has in the past been defined as an owner's right.
Data pertaining to the specific car will probablly be required to be
available.   Data only used to build aggregate fleet data might still
be protected.  Being able to modify the parameters might impair the manufacturers "Fleet"
air quality/fuel efficiency averages, without a exeption which may be
part of the final law.
An owner could of course replace the entire control system with a retrofit.
This practice of encryption might also be to protect the market for computerized tools sold to repair shops.  At $5000 apiece per car make per
repair shop that's a lot of money.
If safety is really the issue then tamper evident seals on the systems
might be able to absolve the manufacturers, unless the ability to hack
the systems is considered an "Attractive Nusiance".  Consumer Protection
laws are pretty harsh in the country, remember computers don't usually kill
people when they fail,  cars certainly can.
And all this is just the complexity that I can think of.  Imagine a team
of lobbyists and their presenations.

Similar to DeCSS, only one Palladium chip needs to be reverse engineered and
it's key(s) broken to virtualize the machine.  Simulate a Pentium VI in Java and
all extant code could be accessed.  Similarly, is Microsoft's signing keys were
cracked  then any code could be signed.
If the software needs a real-time connection to the internet though, then
protection could be built into it.  Laptop applications would be vulnerable
until we have pervasive wireless connection.
How many bits do you think MS will use for the keys?

Quoting Jay Sulzberger :
A separate dongle can't verify the integrity of the processor.  The important
part is that the processor's state (including initial RAM load) is verifiable.
Without this the OS could be virtualized and modified after the integrity check.
Just imagine running Windows Media Player on a virtual machine, trapping the calls to the audio card and thus being able to copy content perfectly.  A dongle can't prevent this.
Eventually for TCPA to be effective against hardware hacks such as memory probes, not only will the harddrive storage be sealed, but RAM must be sealed as well.
Once TCPA moves onprocessor, I expect encrypted RAM will be next.
