But to download all the packages first, how can I do that automatically?
I guess I can use -d, but the machines are up to date right now.

up2date -k The -k option tells up2date to search that directory first for updates.
You'll still contact the RHN servers to get the package list, but if the
updated package is found in your pre-specified directory, it will be
installed from there.

Is there a way to automatically download updated rpm packages?  I'm
about to rebuild a bunch of machines and I have the outdates packages
from the CD.  I don't want the systems to redownload all the updated
packages.  Ryan Golhar
