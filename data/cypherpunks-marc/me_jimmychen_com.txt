@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Secure email with limited usable metadata 
This poses a really interesting question.
Another solution would be to use already existing remailers, and doubling
the encryption together with the TO: email in the inline plaintext. The
question is how to properly do a dual encryption.
My proposed solution is the following:
Plaintext message (encrypted for recipient, with unencrypted portion
dictating the recipient through inline text) -> Encrypted Message
(encrypted again to remailer's PGP, including inline portion) -> Remailer
(decrypted intended layer. Message is sent to recipient dictated in the
inline text) -> Recipient's Email Server / Provider (cannot be read by
provider) -> Recipient Mailbox
