@_subject: SpywareNuker Promotions 
Hello,  just wanted to send over a quick email to see if your company had any
extra CPA solo-mailing inventory or pop-under inventory. We have a software
application that may be of interest to you: SpyWareNuker.
The software is converting at 5.9 sales for every 100 clicks through our
internal list. This product is selling so well because it's something that
every Internet surfer can use. Check it out for yourself and you'll see why
it's an easy sell.
We pay twice per month, and are never late. I know that some companies take
forever to pay, but we use a third party system to pay our affiliates, this
guarantees that a company cannot spend the money that you generated for them
:) This protects you, and you should always ask companies to use a third
party for payment reasons. Here are the payouts:
$6.98 per sale of the $19.95 download
$10.68 per sale of the $29.95 download
$18.06 per sale of the $49.90 download
We provide real time stats so that you can see sales as they come in.
Another great feature is that you'll receive the "Name" and "Email" address
of each person from your site that purchases SpyWareNuker. The benefit of
this is that you will now have a very valuable email address of a known
Internet buyer, and you can create a new database to send offers to them
directly. Promoting SpyWareNuker will help you bring in revenue right away,
but will also help your sales in the future.
Please let me know if your company would be interested in promoting
SpyWareNuker and earning a high eCPM.
Thank you, and we look forward to working with you and your company.
