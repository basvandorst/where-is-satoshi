Good day,
Got to know of you in search for a reputable and reliable
person to assist me in an urgent need requiring utmost
trust and confidentiality,while browsing the internet after
I and my colleagues have decided on what to do as regards the matter.
I am Mr Habib Sanusi, the manager Bills and Exchange
under foreign remittance department of Emirate Bank of
Dubai U.A.E International. I am writing this letter to ask for your
support and co-operation  to carry out this business
opportunity in my department.
We discovered an abandoned sum of US$24.million in an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who
died along with his entire family of a wife and three
children in October 1998,in a plane crash.
Do send your private telephone and fax number,so that we can start the process to enable you receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund will be safe and I will fly to
your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investments.
To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return response.
My warm regards,
Mr Habib Sanusi.
