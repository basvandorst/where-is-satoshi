@_subject: Copyright infringement notice 
Hello ,
I get copyright notices from companies like Irdeto , saying that one of my
customers IP is downloading unauthorized material using bittorent. I also
have processes in place to handle such notices .
Can anyone share how he handles such notices in his ISP environment , i am
ready to adapt some valid steps to improve the existing process.
Or should i just ignore such messages ?
