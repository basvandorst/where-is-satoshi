Dear Partner, My name is Hubert Duke a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP),Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which haveremained dormant since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Bankers Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945).Most belonged to Holocaust victims.The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts -54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts,securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that wereinterest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 45,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discoveredby me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of theirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the lawfor management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate living no wills. Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contactsfor claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be banked in theEurope, America or United Kingdom, being a safe for funds and we can share the funds anduse in investment of our choice. Due to the sensitive nature of my job,I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you. Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name in the Holland or London, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 percent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED. You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites:            The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement, I find myself privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks. Due to security reasons, reply to me via email only. Reply to me securely on the following email, hubertd70  Thank you for your prompt response. Mr Hubert Duke.
