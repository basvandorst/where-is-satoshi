I totally disagree.  I respect people who give their opinion outright.  We can flop about and sugar coat everything, try to make everyone feel fuzzy... and all that does is lead to misunderstandings and openings for more convoluted and pointless discussions.  I've been a part of the open source community for over 20 years, and mostly we're a group of free thinking, well-intentioned individuals who have many irons in the fire.  We know the value of our time, and thus respect the value of others' time as well.  Our projects are not a place for discussions that can have no resolution: politics, religion, general conspiracy theories.
I'm behind Jim on this.
