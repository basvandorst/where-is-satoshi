When is the last time you were arrested, or even in a legal situation
which required your attention as a defendant? It seems pretty straight
forward, but I can assure you this guy is getting very little sleep and
his heart is beating out of his chest. Granted this entire situation is
taking place in a legal venue which I have no understanding of (The EU
obviously does things differently). I think it was pretty risky to
consider running a Tor node, much less being involved in running multiple
nodes. This entire situation is beginning to read like a Kim DotCom (or
Schmitz for those of us who worked for him at some point) novel, where an
outside force directed a local LEA to perform some kind of raid to get
someone's attention. This was obviously not a helicopter raid with SWAT,
ala RapidShare, but I hope you get the point. This guy is sweating bullets
because he has no idea what is going to happen next (in my humble
opinion), so his rational thought process and/or even discussing when he
will return the funds donated is a pre-mature at best.

It's difficult to compare a guy in Austria to a multi-billion dollar
corporation. Here in the US, the fed has charged 3 men with involuntary
manslaughter for their parts in the Gulf of Mexico Rig explosion. BP
received a slap on the wrist, and a decent (to us, not them) sized fine.

Something like tor doesn't work if it is all traffic that's "free
speech" regarding the regime of whatever country the user lives in.
If it were, it'd be just as sensible to set a DETAIN_AND_TORTURE_ME
bit on your IP traffic instead.

Net net - what we have here is, so far, relatively low tech exploits with a
huge element of brute force, and the only innovation being in the delivery
mechanism - very well crafted spear phishes
They don't particularly need to hide in a location where they're literally
bulletproof (considering how many crimes have the death penalty in china,
said penalty being enforced by a bullet to the head and your family billed
for the bullet, if I remember correctly)
Now there's a light shone on it all, despite the official denial, you'll
simply see this office building shift to an even more anonymous business
park halfway across the country (or maybe inside an army base that people
just can't wander into and photograph), and the exploits will simply start
to cover their traces better.
Sure they'll evolve - let them.  The point here is that they're going to
evolve anyway if we let them operate with impunity from a location where
they're bulletproof.
