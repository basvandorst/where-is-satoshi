If my memory is correct, chefren was the chief proponent of building
in surveillance technologies on the IETF RAVEN list, which was
chartered to decide the response of the IETF to government requests
in that regard. (More or less - my memory isn't exact on the wording.)
The resultant discussions were rather heated and quickly went
nowhere, which didn't stop chefren from singlehandedly trying to make
others see the error of their ways.
So the forwarded message is not particularly surprising. (I don't know "Rob Carlson".)

The DNS has redundancy designed into it; there is no real advantage to
having a disjoint set of servers for the two domains. You may as well
have the widest possible set of servers for both.
That doesn't seem right; traceroutes to both servers indicate that
they are likely topologically distant. One appears to be around
Washington, DC, and the other somewhere on the west coast.
Indeed so.

Both ns1.secure.net and ns2.secure.net are returning SERVFAIL for A
record queries for cryptome.org. That almost certainly indicates a
misconfiguration on those two machines. John, you may want to start
harassing your new provider to fix this.
Alternatively, it could be that those two servers are not the correct
ones for cryptome.org; then getting a SERVFAIL would make some sense.
