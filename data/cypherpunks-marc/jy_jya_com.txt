It is a fact that proffr/mattd is Declan. Confirming the practice
of cpunks confecting imaginary personas to vent their inner
evildoing then protesting the vile behavior, disclaiming any
contact with their perps. Then campaigning to have the shits
banned from an putative open liars forum.
That's what non-fiction was invented for, telling lies to uphold
the truth -- which is itself a favorite conceit of the non-fictioneers.
Facts, just the irrefutable facts, are the makings of reputations
made in heaven and hell -- two more tools of the narrative
trade pliers.
Truth hoots. Prosecutors are hooters. If the facts don't convince
grand juries, avid readers all, then cook up an expert to swear
on a bible cookbook.
