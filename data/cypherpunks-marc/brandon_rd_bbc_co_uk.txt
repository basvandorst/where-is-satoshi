a) you give them the crystals and warn that in isolation they can
   be unstable so drive slow
b) you give them the internet to take away
   c) you point to egypt and tell them the kill switch is there, just
   turn it to a higher setting than their government used
Are you crazy, they'll then know where else to visit. This is a trap.
