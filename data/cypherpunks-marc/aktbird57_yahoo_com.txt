@_subject: Nigerian Scam 
On Feb 19th of this year, I got nearly (the name, linda bonga, was changed to, elfrida bongo, but the rest was exact, down to Wiseman the 3rd) the same email as you posted here... Believe it or not, I now have $49,500 in my bank account because of it. Although this is due to be returned to its rightfull place shortly. If you'd like verification you can call me in Illinois @ 618-922-0882. I'll copy an email I sent to a Nigerian scam site below. It tells some of the details. It has been a weird 2 months with constant contact from Nigeria...strange...
I read with interest your Nigerian Scam site. Although I had not read much before this February on this stuff I had received numerous emails of the type you mention. They are so obviously a scam, that I am amazed at how many are duped. I responded to a letter about 6 months ago as a lark. The person emailed me back & told me that I needed to travel to Nigeria. I responded that I would if they would send me a ticket or the money for it. My next email from this person (whose used the name, Osato Willy) told me that I should show myself to be a person of standing by buying my own ticket. Yada yada yada. I never received another email from this person, but used the email when sending out a newsletter to friends. He would be the 'to' address with everyone else in the bcc field.
All that is kinda boring. But WAIT!! On February 22, 2002, I received a similar email from an, 'Elfrida Bongo' claiming all the usual stuff about $30 million from a dead person if I would claim to be a relative, etc. etc. I was sitting @ the computer when it came in. I emailed back, 'tell me more', along with my cell phone  Within 10 minutes I get a phone call from Nigeria (I was able to tell this is where it was from because the phone # came through on caller ID). What has happened between now & then are that I was given a toll free # in Canada (after many of the 'official' documents were faxed to me & I faxed them my banking particulars) the money was supposedly held, ready to be transferred. Upon calling that # I was told that I needed $8500 to release the money. When the Nigerian contact called I told him this & that I didn't have the money. I expected this to be the end of our dialogue. It was not to be so. He told me to call the, "Foreign Payment Centre", in Canada &!
 t!
ell them to take it out of the money and if that didn't work, try to bribe him.
That didn't work & supposedly the money was transferred back to Nigeria. The odd part, to me, was that I was never once pressured for money. During the next few weeks my Nigerian contact was telling me that more money was needed now to get the money back out of Nigeria and into my account. This person told me that he was going to get money to me that would facilitate getting out the $30 mil. Once a day about 3 weeks ago, I received at my work (I never have given them my home # or address) a FedEx overnight package from Nigeria. In this was a cashier's check in the amount of $36,576. It was from a bank in Wisconsin (I am in Illinois). I immediately called the bank to verify that the account was good and that funds were available. THEY WERE! The check was Good!
Now I was perplexed. What were these scammers doing sending me a valid cashier's check for this amount? I called the company whose account the check was drawn on. After being passed to a couple of people I finally found out (after faxing them a copy) that the check was a forgery, albeit a very good one. The signatures were authorized signatures & exactly matched the signatures on file. The check color was incorrect, blue where their's are green. And the number on the check was out of sequence.
This now made sense again. When the man from Nigeria called, I informed him that the check was a forgery, I again expected this to be the last I heard from them. After evincing surprise and horror he told me he would call me back. That was on a Friday and he called me back the following Monday. He went round & round about whose fault it might be yada yada. He was still working on getting me funding. The next week (last week) he called saying that he had procured more funding and that he was having cash sent straight into my account and that it would be there on Friday. Friday, as I was instructed, I checked my balance. Someone had overnighted me a personal check for $49,500 into my account!!
There is more to this store but I am going to cut it short for now. A week has passed and the check has cleared. I informed my Nigerian contact via email that the Secret Service had been in contact with me & wanted to know what was going on. The truth is that I had called them shortly after I got the fake cashier's check & they were only mildly interested. I'm not sure at this point what's going to happen, but it has been interesting. Three days have passed now without hearing from my Nigerian friend again. I keeping the money in a special account so that it cannot be access by ACH (in case the Nigerian's try to get it). If someone has been duped into sending me money, I will have it for them.
