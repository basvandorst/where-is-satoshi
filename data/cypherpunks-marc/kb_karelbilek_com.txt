You cannot have it both ways.
The domain system will either be centralized with name arbitration and
without cybersquatting, but with domain ceisures; or decentralized,
but with rampant cybersquatting.
I can't imagine how to do decentralized DNS with domain name
arbitration. You need to have a central power to do this.

@_subject: my little tool for torrents 
Because I think it's still a bit hard to share bigger data than a
pastebin with the world anonymously, I did a little "tool" for
anonymous file sharing
what I mean by that - you upload the data on my server with Tor via
web interface, accessible only as a hidden service, and I then seed
the file until it gets "traction", which I arbitrarily say is 20
I don't have an idea how popular will that be, so I am sharing it with
this not-exactly-alive mailing list first :)

I don't understand this idea, at all. (I don't like the current tribler,
its decentralized search is a throwback to all the gnutella systems of the
past; I think bittorrent is showing that there is still a need for
centralized repository with control)
What are the proxy nodes? Is it like Tor with only volunteers? Is it like
Freenet where every user is a proxy? Or are they themselves the proxy
Also, I think they are basically doing two things that are in opposition -
making bittorrent faster and making it more anonymous.
This will not work.

I mean, yeah, THE MAN probably has tons of data on me (some of which I
willfully uploaded on social networks), but it's not possible to watch

but more... personally. There are so many people saying stupid shit
online that noone is really going to pay attention to some guy who
just happens to mention bitcoin and bittorrent in the same sentence
and that downloads some comics once in a while, since they are more
busy with people who mention bomb and islam in the same sentence.

afaik, some people tracked down silk road, because they don't use

you can request some really small amount of money from silkroad to
your bitcoin address repeatedly, and then try to find their node in
p2p bitcoin network by heuriatics, based on how fast the information
comes from each node (the faster ones->closer to actual silkroad
I heard it could be tracked this way and is in Netherlands ;)
anyway the moral of the story is to use bitcoin also with tor

maybe it's off topic, but did any of you tried RetroShare?
I like how every data jumps only between trusted friends, so you can't
really share your IP with authorities.
Yeah, it has a negative side- you need to have trusted friends who use
it (of which I have zero sadly) and those must also be "well
connected". and if you add someone evil as a friend, he can watch you.
but I really like the idea.

@_subject: Re: [liberationtech] Mailvelope: OpenPGP Encryption for Webmail 
Because Thomas (the original developer of Mailvelope) wanted to let
the extension work as it was, with the unsecure encryption inside DOM,
I decided to fork his project and make a new one, which both encrypts
and decrypts in a secure chrome pop-up.
It's here, it's called ChromeGP.
Available on chrome web store here
and on github here
There are two big issues with it - first is missing signing/signature
control (which should be easy to implement, but we will see) and the
second is OpenPGP's trouble with zip compression inside PGP (which,
unfortunately, causes the default Thunderbird/Enigmail encryption fail
to decrypt, I think).
Feel free to share and/or criticize :)

@_subject: Re: [liberationtech] Mailvelope: OpenPGP Encryption for Webmail 
What I now implemented and put as a github pull request to the original
the extension user can now use a chrome pop-up for writing the mail
(not meaning pop-up as an annoying ad window, but as a chrome
extension window that displays when you click on the extension icon)
AFAIK, no javascript can display such an extension pop-up and also
can't intercept anything.
I also added a big red warning, instructing to open the pop-up, that
shows whenever the original encryption is triggered from inside the
regular webmail DOM (it's still possible to use the extension is
"unsafe" way with mail provider intercepting, but you have to ignore
the warning).
Let's hope Thomas accepts those changes and adds them to the main extension

If he did that, it would be great.
Because really I stopped using classic mails in favor of

hm, we talked about this extension today
how much is it REALLY safe to use webmail (particularly gmail) with this?
the thing is... GMail is saving your mail while you type and this
extension is not stopping it in any way. so, google has the data about
your mails - and more importantly, if you  are tracked by
fbi/whatever, they can start actively track your keypresses by
to add the salt to the injury, this extension works with chrome
(closed source) only and has problems installing on chromium.

OK, I just REALLY want to thank you right now.
We will have a small talk when we will want to demonstrate how to
easily use mail encryption with popular clients
we found out that none of us lecturers even use thunderbird, let alone
knows how to set up the encryption. all of use use webmails. we
suppose our audience does, too.
for this, mailvelope is AWESOME. It "just works".
it has one big downside though.... it doesn't support UTF8 in either
name of key owner OR in the message itself (it totally mangles all
UTF8 input). if you speak with a language that has diacritics (we
speak Czech), it sucks a bit.
small downside - it doesn't encrypt attachment and doesn't (AFAIK)
sign the messages.
but if they catch all these issues, it will be great

Well it's dead (as in codebase), but the p2p network still works, there are
stuff added to the blockchain all the time.
However it is currently not suited for saving bigger files (as I wrote to
the git repo, it eats too much memory and diskspace and I am not exactly
sure why), just smaller text files, I would say. I wanted to build some
simple GUI for that but I currently don't have time for that.

I built a way to save any arbitrary files to the namecoin blockchain.
(so you can save any stuff forever and anonymously)
It is totally slow and inefficient but I think it's partly the fault
of the namecoin daemon.

AFAIK, inside pirate parties, there are always people that shout "we

and people that shout "we should do less issues, we know nothing about
tax reform and medicine, and we will not agree on anything meaningful
And, as somebody said before, because it's a political party, you have
to do compromises, so they usually try to go somewhere in the middle.
