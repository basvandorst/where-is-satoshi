Ultimately your system will have a major flaw: passwords are typically have

The ideal system would be to use Tor in conjunction with guerrillamail. Or
to use a preshared key with a block cipher, and hide the encryption (since

With this in mind, officers and public officials should be highly aware of
their email account security and their online presence and exposure. For
example, posting images wearing uniforms displaying name tags or listing
their police department on social media sites can increase an officer's
risk of being targeted or attacked.
Many legitimate online posts are linked directly to personal social media

In 1793, it took less then a year for Napoleon to raise an army of a

In WWII, it took America several years to build up it's fighting strength
to a level capable of fighting the Nazis.
Perhaps today, if we were to start a military from scratch, it will take
fifteen years to do it (probably longer if you desire aircraft).
The point I'm making is indirect, there is a lot of inertia today brought
on by the complexity of technology. The decisions made today once fully
implemented cannot be changed for a while.
The elites have made wrong decisions, they have erred in the direction of
mass surveillance instead of mass liberty, but it did not stop the success
of terrorists. Now we are all less secure. Apparently Juniper routers were
backdoored... some of which were used by US agencies. One seems to hear

decrypt past communications ( as if that has been a major obstacle to
investigations prior to the computer).
But I ramble, to be very clear, to make the internet itself secure, it will
probably take ten years. While frequent derisions that people don't use
encrypted databases are nonsensical, the solutions more likely to yield a
result will take longer to implement.

Their statements are hard to decipher on the subject, but not hard to
figure out.
It is usually easier to make everything but the cipher weak. Protocols
and programs commonly used are either not done properly or non
standardized, and best practices have been slow in coming.
Furthermore, the FBI has not been clear on this, but apparently they
want data in motion to be decrypted and encrypted by a central point,
and for data at rest to not be encrypted. (I seriously doubt Marcy
Wheeler's claims of Comey's charisma if he has not even been able to
say in one sentence about what the FBI wants, unless she's flirting
with him)
For groups to organize they need to communicate. Criminals use off the
shelf encryption tools, and their devices are not continuously
connected, and even less likely to be able to run root code on each
other's devices (although social engineering does work).
What the NSA and the CIA does is harder to guess, but it becomes

design a proper protocol (AFAIK). Furthermore, you do hear in the news

To who would this serve?
The ISDN standard itself is a curious thing, according to a /wikipedia/

would they be okay with increasing the arbitrary nature of the world?
Afterall, privacy for the sake of privacy and freedom for the sake of
freedom is sort of pointless. Personally I'm against tyranny, as a result
of personal experiences, even thought about how Tor could be improved. But
all tyranny is simply the arbitary whims of a tyrant, nothing more.

The problem with writing an after action report of the First Crypto War is
that apparently everyone involved are idiots or shills, and the only

clipper chip.
And then a few academics found that there is a problem with the Clipper
chip protocol, the 16-bit hash was insecure. Apparently the NSA cannot
write good protocols. Should've been a bigger scandal, it'd be like a

cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains.
Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial

all incoming traffic via a VPN to a 'Blot' server that handles actual
connection requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client
authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants
can do that), the connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver
that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing

Okay, I'll give you an answer: The CIA is set up so that it's impossible
for a person as an individual to arrogate to himself the right to lie to a
congressional committee or to anyone else. But what he can or cannot say is
clearly specified from the day he is sworn in. He can lie to people who are
not his bosses, who do not have security clearances. Most congressmen do
not have security clearances. When Senator Frank Church asked me something,
and he said, "Will you take an oath," I said, "Senator, I'll take the oath,
and I wouldn't think of telling you the truth." Personally, I like Colby
very much. He's a very fine man, but he's just the wrong kind of guy to be
head of the CIA. He's a good guy.
For unknown reasons, this has been totally forgotten. Fortunately we rely
on Snowden to remember for us, and he says he revealed the truth for the
first time ever. The news media backs him up on this. And Applebaum kept
his high salary mainly because he was good with the media (or the media was

In the same minute of MSNBC, you could hear about how special interests
control too much of our politics, but that foreign countries need more
democracy. We were attempting to spread democracy to Afghanistan, but
Harmid Karzai is incredibly corrupt. The war on terror has all but ended
opposition politics in Malaysia (
 watch this and try to figure
out how this guy is in the cabinet) . Actually the War on Terror aims to
fund the security services of foreign governments to build non-direct
diplomatic links to other power structures of a country.
Everyone criticizes Hoover, but count the number of former Directors of the
FBI and CIA who went on to become President. Alternatively, how many
Hoovers are the CIA funding overseas? Why does the New York Times presents
a less accurate view of the world than say... Gary Brecher or Zero Hedge?
It's very difficult to change parts of the world without replacing their
education systems, but we usually go guns ablazing instead. Police stand by
while armed bandits in Mexico steal gasoline. What is going on in the
world? What is being tolerated? What is being ineffectively fought against?
Who is in control?
Officially, there is the democratic peace theory, but we are against Iran,
a democracy (perhaps its opposition is more regulated than ours, but still
a democracy). What is the true reason behind the democratic peace theory?
Perhaps when a country is sufficiently owned by international interests, it
wouldn't benefit the international interests to have the two countries
fight each other. When did democracy first become widespread, and what
international interests gained power in that time?

Based on the number of concurrent discovered bugs, at least a few.
Statistical techniques won't work when it is only discovered bugs.
But the fact that severe bugs are in a distro for over a year makes it
irrelevant how many there is. A systematic effort to search for bugs and to

I should give some credit to leftist conspiracy twitter, but that might be
problematic. Still, the proof is not hard to find, which just makes it all
rather depressing.
Obviously connection number one is they still are nonprofits. People live
at the mercy of the state to a greater degree than they realize.
Connection number two is that Morris Ernst was J. Edgar Hoover's close
friend, or so he thought. Rather Hoover tasked an FBI agent to reply to
correspondence to him, so effectively Hoover had an informant within the
ACLU. There has been very little said on this topic.
Connection number three is that J.P. Barlow, founder of the EFF was
contacted by Robert Steele in 1992 (currently believes there is a child sex
slave colony on Mars) to speak at an intelligence conference.
  (but
it was pretty prescient "Nonetheless, I sallied forth, confidently telling
the gray throng that power lay not in concealing information but in
distributing it, that the Internet would endow small groups of zealots with
the capacity to wage credible assaults on nation-states, that young hackers
could easily run circles around old spies.")
Connection number four is that Morton Halperin negotiated with the CIA to
support the passage of Intelligence Identities Protection Act. Morton
Halperin was suspected of leaking that the US was bombing Cambodia,
although clearly we should've used drones then. Morton Halperin has served

The Linux kernel today faces an unprecedented safety crisis. Much like when
Ralph Nader famously told the American public that their cars were "unsafe

Linux Security Summit in Toronto that the operating system needs a total

No longer the niche concern of years past, Linux today underpins the server
farms that run the cloud, more than a billion Android phones, and not to
mention the coming tsunami of grossly insecure devices that will be hitched
to the Internet of Things. Today's world runs on Linux, and the security of
its kernel is a single point of failure that will affect the safety and
well-being of almost every human being on the planet in one way or another.

It's hard to say whether it should be surprising that Operation Northwoods
was committed to paper on government letterhead. An official government
document proposing terrorism against the American people. And throughout
history there were 53 admitted false flags:
 .
So it becomes fair to wonder what was so big about anthrax, and why Matt
deHart had to be arrested on trumped up charges.
On Page 88 of Part 10 of 59 on the FBI's released Amerithrax investigation,
a psychological profile without letterhead is provided. There are also
presumably letters from Ivins against fat people near the beginning of the
PDF file.
But if the CIA was responsible, would the FBI know, or would they have been
just doing their jobs? It's a pretty power argument for people just doing
their jobs when virtually every Nazi gave it as a reason. You'd have the
BAU giving facially a specific profile, but in reality about 1% or so would
qualify, so it'd fall under Schneier's arguments for no terrorist catching
system is effective (although clearly it won't be completely automated).
Then you'd have field agents under pressure to solve the case, they might
just be rationalizing why what their doing is correct.
For all it takes for Bruce Ivins to be falsely accused is for the CIA to
stay mum, and for the FBI to do their jobs?
In proportion to the punishment, murder convictions are inaccurate, one in
nine are exonerated based on retested DNA evidence. The CSI effect is quite
fortunate, or that rate would be higher, the police only gather enough
evidence to ensure a conviction, not to ensure they don't have an innocent
person. The probability that OJ was guilty was in all fairness, 40%.
Another 40% it was Jason. 20% it could've been anyone else. Legally, no

============================== START ==============================
Gary Sick's is an interesting story. Sick is the author of October
Surprise, one of the best accounts of the covert deal struck in the Fall of
1980 between senior Republicans, arms merchants and Iranian mullahs to
delay the return of the American hostages until Ronald Reagan's
inauguration. But as interesting as it is, that's not the story I mean. I'm
talking about Sick's own story: his passage from career White House insider
to "conspiracy theorist."
My experience was not unlike that of a medieval scholar discovering traces
of a hidden text beneath the script of an old parchment.... I felt as if I
were wandering into a spy novel. The backgrounds and activies of some of
these individuals who were emerging from the shadows of this operation
seemed to come out of fiction, and yet they were real.... most of my
professional life had been spent as an analyst of political and military
intelligence. I knew that there were operatives for hire, ready to skirt
the law for money, perhaps out of habit or duty, or simply for the thrill
and sense of power illegal acts conveyed. But it was nonetheless a shock to
meet them....
Such characters are a researcher's nemesis; they are meant to be. When the
CIA or other intelligence agencies need to hire a "contractor," who may be
required to carry out taks that are potentially dangerous and of
questionable legality, they look for three things: a specific and useful
skill (a knowledge of money-laundering, perhaps); a romantic streak that
glorifies both the secrecy and the risk; and a propensity for exageration
and trouble. One former CIA officer, David MacMichael, has said that the
agency looks for these freelancers at small community airports and gun
ranges - places where men go to excape the boredom of everyday life.
Looking for adventure, these men are fascinated by the imagined glamour and
excitement of the world of espionage. MacMichael said that often, after one
or two assignments, the agency will put a contractor on a case in which he
runs afoul of the law. The contractor finds himself in a compromising
position - nothing so major as to put him permanently out of commission,
but significant enough that if he ever starts telling tales out of school
about covert operations, his record will discredit his testimony.
Take, for instance, the case of Delmart Vreeland. A scoundrel by every
account, but also one with exceptional information for those with ears to
hear. He did pass on the "Let one happen, stop the rest" warning from a
Toronto jail cell before 9/11; his claim that Canadian diplomat Marc
Bastien had been poisoned in Moscow has been proven correct; the Pentagon
unwittingly acknowledged his lengthy service record when it was called in
open court, by relying on archived records undamaged by the 9/11 attack
from which he had not been purged (the prosecution argued, incredibly, that
Vreeland must have hacked into the Pentgon files from his jail cell); Leo
Wanta, longtime intelligence asset who destabilized the Soviet ruble in the
'80s at the White House request, confirmed Vreeland was an operative of the
Office of Naval Intelligence; his lawyers did receive death threats and
found their files vandalized; and Vreeland has vanished.
But none of that matters to the coincidentalists, who stubbornly refuse to
see deeper than the "legends" created for men like Vreeland, which is
precisely the point. So Lee Harvey Oswald is a "communist," and Barry Seal
just a drug runner. That Oswald was seen with the CIA's David Atlee
Phillips in September 1963, and Barry Seal was gunned down with Vice
President George Bush's personal phone number in his trunk, need to be
ignored. The coincidentalists can't make sense of such evidence, that
respectable men would have anything to do with such characters. But without
them, some respectable men would be able to do very little.
Well, Vreeland had since the essay been written, convicted of soliciting
child prostitution in Franklin County, which is a bit messed up if you
heard the backstory of Franklin County.
The moment we live in a free society is probably when Kiriakou is working
at an Apple Store and is visited by the Attorney General and when Thomas
Drake has a fellowship with a major think tank, and it is when Delmart
Vreeland is a free man not on trumped up charges.
I think Marine One with Obama in it flew by my house once.

I've previously written about there was only a 40% chance OJ killed his

It also leads to arguments about how arguments on parallel construction is
not convincing, those arguments pretty much boil down to the government is
being suspiciously secretive and illegally dishonest.
I found the arguments on parallel construction to be more convincing than
the Clipper chip though, but upon further thought, I'm not longer convinced
by current arguments against parallel construction. The defendant still
committed the crime (ignoring selective enforcement), it is just that
classified information is used as hints to find a different set of
evidence. They were proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, a very high
bar to meet.
Or is it a very high bar to meet? The ACLU, the great absolutionists of our
time, insist on no death penalty. Because based on the number of people who
were exonerated before ever being executed should have instead been
sentenced to life imprisonment, who if exonerated, would still be released?
Well ignoring that, there is an alarming number of people convicted beyond
a reasonable doubt. Based on some circumstantial evidence here, prior
relationship there, lack of alibi, and having the same blood type (although
thanks to CSI, more exacting and numerous tests are demanded now), and you
have a pretty convincing story (which is all it takes).
Obviously the proper argument is to find that all murderers were
incorrectly convicted and should be retried under stricter procedures.
Everyone bemoans that Matthew Keys was convicted by... a jury. We have
fallen far, far, below our desired standard for "... ten guilty persons
escape than that one innocent suffer".
My argument about parallel construction is different, the defendants should
have access to classified information to prove their innocence if there is
a large scale program by the government to prove guilt using classified
information. It could give an edge to the defendant to find that one
pattern or one bit of evidence that would throw doubt onto the
prosecution's case. Because the defendant is not presumed innocent. If
there is no doubt as to the prosecution's case, the jury will convict, do
not delude yourself otherwise.

I am reminded of an anecdote (of which, our entire history books are made
up of):
I have played a lot of Dungeons and Dragons, and related, games in my life.
Rolling dice are an intrinsic part of such games, because they allow
unusual things to happen, unusual results that surprise and amaze. Dice
also give people the illusion of control over Fate...dice are random, yet
people often feel like they are able to 'control' the probabilities, in a
kind of real magick, some unexplained ability. When highly improbable
events with dice occur, it is easy to believe such nonsense. Or perhaps we
humans can affect probability...I will let you be the judge, for yourself.
One time, during my days as a paid, professional DM, I had been running a
free game for some people I was involved with at the time, and the brother
of the person I was most involved with at the time came up to me and made a
rather incredible statement.
His friend was visiting, had heard of what fame I had back in those days,
and wanted to meet me...and by the way, this friend could ALWAYS roll
within one number of any target on a 20 sided die.  Without fail. On any
die. Any time.
Sheah, my ass! Still, since the fellow was visiting, and since it really
would not take any time to see for myself, and since he was a big fan of
mine, I agreed to put up with whatever farce would be tossed to me.
The first five or six rolls, each on a different die from my personal
collection were all perfect and exact. The value '20', time after time.
Then I borrowed the dice collection of an observing friend, doubting my own
dice, despite the fact that I had painted them myself (you had to in those
days) and knew my own dice inside and out (I have an enormous collection of
polyhedral dice). The next five or six rolled I called at random....just
picking numbers out of the blue. Whether it was an 18, or a 3, or a 12, or
20 again....this young man always, and without fail, on any die I gave him,
(so long as it was a twenty-sided die, he could not do it on any other die)
he could roll within one number. When I called 18, as I remember, he rolled
17, for instance. He never missed, not even once, and I must have tested
him several dozen times. I wanted more, but he was getting bored, besides,
I had run out of fresh, new d20's to use. We used every d20 anyone had. I
would not repeat using the same die, trying to see if somehow the dice were
He did not know how he did this trick. He just noticed, one day, that he
could do it. He was not that amazed by it anymore. He had been doing it for
several years. Adults could not care less, or refused to even bother to
look. I was almost so skeptical myself, that I nearly shunned him as well.
I am glad I did not, in retrospect.
To this day I have no explanation whatsoever for what I saw. I tested the
lads claim as carefully as I could, given the situation, and there was no
shortage of witnesses from every angle. He did not palm the die, or do
anything odd....several times I asked him to simply hold out his hand, palm
up, where I deposited a d20, and had him just roll the die off of his palm,
without closing his fingers. Just let the die fall off and hit the table.
It made no difference.
I have no idea what ever became of the boy, but I will always remember
whatever it was that he could do.

Ideally though, one would have a low performance computer with high

attestation, hash the loaded instructions, and induce a fault if the
instructions change (thus causing any insecurity to be limited to
improperly coded APIs). Integrate ClamAV, and harden it's sandbox?

nearly as fast as AES-NI, clearly Linux's /dev/random/ is not fully
understood and should be avoided. For the entropy estimate only counts the
entropy of individual events, but not the total combinatorial complexity.
Since operating systems have no real time guarantee, and all entropy is a
product of unobserved events, the order in which events occur certainly
adds entropy. Given that combinatorial complexity is not factored in
entropy estimates, the entropy estimate should be considered flawed.
In fact, this combinatorial complexity significantly impacts one's ability
to manipulate the output of the generator without knowing the full state,
and it might be dangerous for /dev/random/ to treat any source of entropy
as 8 bits per byte.
Perhaps only those capable of communicating in pure deduction can only be
trusted by others capable of communicating in the same fashion.
Of course the ability to deduce has long been regarded as the prerequisite
to investigate or understand anything, and is the foundation of all logic
and reason.
In the end though, I must repeat someone else's observation, that Google

What the Russians did at Beslan was wholly negligent. They pumped in
tranquilizer gas, they can do that, governments are allowed some discretion
in that area. But the gas was apparently classified, they had civilian
doctors treat the victims without any knowledge about it. Russia isn't a
small country, they have plenty of military doctors they could have pulled
to treat people.
They also take in corruption as much money as the Soviets had spent on
defense. Instead of protecting their country or investing in it, they
enrich themselves many times over.
They also ban comedy. No legitimate government bans comedy.
P.S. The Soviets import as much grain as Russia currently exports. Someone,

@_subject: What everyone is saying about mobile OS security is wrong 
Google Play has given Google more control over security. Like Apple's App
Store, one central app distribution point gives Google more security
control. Google noted that Android devices that only download apps from
Google Play are nine times less likely to get a PHA than devices from other
sources. Google Play Protect protects almost two billion devices.
But is the above precisely correct?
While all Android devices benefit from protections built into the platform,
Android devices with Google Play services have an additional layer of
defense to keep them safe. Google protects these devices right out of the
box with Google Play Protect, our built-in device, data, and apps security
scanning technology.
No it is not, Google Play apps are scanned using a cloud anti-virus program.
What else is special about Google Play?
Manufacturers can be refused a licence if they do not meet Google's
requirements. Google does not charge for a GMS licence, but any company
producing an Android device will need a certificate from an authorised
testing facility in order to apply for the licence. That often incurs fees.
One source told the Guardian that the fee varies and is negotiated on a
case-by-case basis, with one example costing $40,000 for a batch of at
least 30,000 devices. A separate source said that in another deal, a
testing facility quoted $75,000 to test 100,000 devices.
And rather recently, Joseph Cox said in tweets within hours of each other
that the US government shutdown a phone maker that could only sell secure
Blackberries to drug dealers and that a judge signed a warrant for any
Google location enabled apps. For some reason, the Tor Project recieves
more free PR than any business providing a phone remotely resembling
anything that is desired by civil libertarians.
You people don't notice anything. At all. You people never accomplish
anything useful you want, ever.
It is extremely trivial for Google to make Android more secure, create an
app anti-virus API, require security updates within one month of the issue
being discovered for Google Play access, etc.
And the question about whether devices should be rooted or not by the user
is pretty simple. An unrooted device is a production environment designed
to be secure by hundreds of people, and the occasional bug bounty. A rooted
device is a development environment whose security is owed to anyone with
physical access to it.

To quote von Hammerstein-Equord:
"The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership
posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for
difficult decisions. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got
rid of, for he is too dangerous."
Thus I posit a third possible outcome of the Gom Jabbar test, that the

exclaiming "I nearly have it!" Even though it was never mentioned to
begin with that there is anything in the box other than pain.

What is the economic value of unrealized technologies? It would be

This is where inflation versus economic growth gets tricky.
Productivity in terms of quantity versus a number of units per year is
immeasurable, and the calculations involved become disturbing.
According to insurance companies, your nationality can determine your
value as a person.
Regardless though, if medicines were discovered that would nullify the

From the documentary Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger
Thirty years ago, my wife and I
purchased a liquor license.
Then we had the liquor store up
and running by Christmas.
We poured our heart and soul in it.
And then, lo and behold,
I get a knock on my door
one night, I'm at the house,
my wife's down at the liquor store
working, and it was Kevin Weeks
and Whitey Bulger at the door,
and I didn't know,
what the hell do they want?
"You got a problem."
I said, "I don't... what problem?"
He says, "Listen,
we were hired to kill you."
I'm like, what?
He said, you got to understand,
the other liquor stores,
they hired us to kill you.
I just couldn't believe it,
I didn't know what to even think,
I was dumbfounded.
Actually, I froze.
He said, "But what we're going to do
instead of that, we're just going to
become your partners." I said, "No,
you're not becoming my partners."
And then, Bulger's right there.
He's just staring at me,
and just grinding his teeth like,
"You don't understand,
we're taking
the f*cking liquor store."
I was like, "It's not for sale."
He said, "I'll f*cking kill you.
I'll stab you, and then I'll kill you."
I'm like, Holy Jesus.
And then they pulled out a gun.
I was like, "Oh, f*ck."
They picked up my kid.
Daughter was a year.
He said, "It would be terrible
for this kid to grow up without a father."
I was like... and I melted.
Nothing you can do.
Ever since that day,
I've never been the same.
I couldn't protect my own children.
As a man, that just took me away.
And I'm not over it yet.
I won't be over, and maybe I'll never
get over it, but I surely can't wait
to get in front of that court,
on that stand and testify
against that. 30 years ago,

From Kafka's The Trial:
"You fool yourself in the court," said the priest, "it talks about
this self-deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law. In front of the
law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to the
door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in
to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if
he'll be able to go in later on. 'That's possible,' says the
doorkeeper, 'but not now'. The gateway to the law is open as it always
is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over
to try and see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and
says, 'If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I
say you can't. Careful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest
of all the doormen. But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and
each of them is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can
stand just to look at the third one.' The man from the country had not
expected difficulties like this, the law was supposed to be accessible
for anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more closely at
the doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his long
thin tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has
permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit
down to one side of the gate. He sits there for days and years. He
tries to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with
his requests. The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where
he's from and many other things, but these are disinterested questions
such as great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still
can't let him in. The man had come well equipped for his journey, and
uses everything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He accepts
everything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that
you don't think there's anything you've failed to do'. Over many
years, the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break. He
forgets about the other doormen, and begins to think this one is the
only thing stopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first
few years he curses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he
becomes old, he just grumbles to himself. He becomes senile, and as he
has come to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over
the years that he has been studying him he even asks them to help him
and change the doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no
longer knows whether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that
are deceiving him. But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light
begin to shine from the darkness behind the door. He doesn't have long
to live now. Just before he dies, he brings together all his
experience from all this time into one question which he has still
never put to the doorkeeper. He beckons to him, as he's no longer able
to raise his stiff body. The doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the
difference in their sizes has changed very much to the disadvantage of
the man. 'What is it you want to know now?' asks the doorkeeper,
'You're insatiable.' 'Everyone wants access to the law,' says the man,
'how come, over all these years, no- one but me has asked to be let
in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's come to his end, his hearing has
faded, and so, so that he can be heard, he shouts to him: 'Nobody else
could have got in this way, as this entrance was meant only for you.
Now I'll go and close it'."
From another part of The Trial:
They're only allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law
allocates them, and they usually know less about the results of their
work after it's left them than the defence does, even though the
defence will usually stay in contact with the accused until the trial
is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can learn many
useful things from the defence.

In a very intriguing article entitled =E2=80=9CThe Nazi Religion: Views on
Religious Statism in Germany and America,=E2=80=9D J.F.C. Moore argues
that Nazism and American conservatism are both deeply rooted
in the Illuminati conspiracy. According to Moore, (1) Nazism
emerged from the Thule Society, a right-wing occult lodge in

Nazism has too many resemblances of right-wing movements in
America for the parallels to be coincidental.
Basically Moore=E2=80=99s theory holds that ever since the American
and French revolutions, certain rightist groups have seen anarchy
as the ultimate result of too much democracy and have tried to
prevent this by forming secret societies devoted to State-worship
and/or Christian Socialism, combined with a Gnostic mystique
of receiving guidance from heavenly or otherworldly beings. This

The "death car" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out
of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then
disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its
color--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other
car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards
beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life
violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark
blood with the dust.
Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open
her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left
breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen
for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the
corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous
vitality she had stored so long.

In contrast to the public conception of "conspiracy theory", the links
uncovered by parapolitical research are rarely lines of command.
Parapolitical activity is not pyramidal like a government hierarchy;
it is connective, a network of nodes like a circle of friends. The
links between the nodes are lines of support arising not from a
command structure, but from a community of interest, shared objectives
and interlocking memberships. Individual groups do not so much set the
agenda or run the show as act within their own sphere of influence or
speciality, occasionally supporting actions taken by others. Many are
isolated and have little impact outside their own country, and here
the Cercle came into its own as a group with a world-wide agenda,
connecting and, to some extent, coordinating the activities of groups
in many different countries. The Cercle complex stands almost alone as
an active international network linking intelligence veterans and
their media manipulators to top right-wing politicians. As to its
significance, one can do no better than to quote Ramsay and Dorril:
"One of the conclusions to be drawn from this essay is about networks.
One common response to the delineation of a network is to say, 'Yes,
all that is interesting, but where is the actual transmission of
power?' To which we would argue - and this is the only claim we make
which might be called theoretical - that the network is the power. A
network of people who are, elsewhere, powerful, is per se a powerful
network." Through its network of private-sector spies and their
disinformation outlets, the Cercle complex could promote or denigrate
public figures not only in their own country, but throughout Europe
and America. Its activities during the Cold War - covert funding,
black propaganda, smear campaigns and, at least, connections to
planned coups d'=C3=A9tat - were those of any intelligence agency, and, in
many ways, that is what the Cercle complex has been: the rogue agents
of the international Right.

@_subject: Someone forgot ten pounds of C-4 in New York 
New York police discovered a trash bag containing around 4.5 kilograms
(10 pounds) of what has been described as C-4 explosive in a Manhattan
cemetery the morning of Oct. 11. The material did not present an
immediate threat, as it was not primed with a blasting cap - a component
required to successfully detonate the explosives - or a firing train for
initiating a blasting cap. The New York Police Department's bomb squad
has reportedly secured the material, but the area around Marble Cemetery
in East Greenwich Village on 2nd Street between 1st and 2nd avenues
remains closed to traffic.
It is difficult to imagine an innocent explanation for how six to eight
blocks of apparent plastic explosive (likely comprising about 3 to 4.5
kilograms) came to be abandoned in the cemetery. Since the material was
not primed, it does not appear to have been in the final phase of
deployment for an attack. While information is still preliminary, there
are a number of potential reasons for the material's presence in the
cemetery. It is possible that the explosives were left there as a dead
drop, to be passed to someone with bombmaking experience to construct an
explosive device. It is also possible that it was simply abandoned there
by someone who wanted to dispose of it. Since C-4 is a military-grade
explosive, it is likely that the material can be traced back to
establish where it was made, who bought it and when, which would provide
clues as to how it ended up Manhattan.
A number of nations manufacture C-4 and military-grade plastic
explosives similar to C-4, such as PE-4A. The New York Police Department
and its U.S. federal law enforcement partners in the FBI and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will certainly be working
overtime to attempt to determine the provenance of these explosives in
order to discover who placed them there and why, in addition to testing
the material to verify that it is in fact explosive and not a hoax. If
the recovered explosives were still in their wrappers with lot numbers
affixed, the job of tracing them will be easier. However, if they were
U.S.-manufactured explosives that had been stolen or captured in a war
zone, the trail may be hard to trace. If the explosive blocks did not
have wrappers with lot numbers, a chemical analysis of the explosives
should help the authorities narrow down the possibilities.
New York remains one of the highest-profile targets for terrorist
attacks in the United States, and plots to detonate explosives there are
regularly investigated and disrupted. The last such plot was the failed
May 1 attempt to detonate a car packed with a poorly constructed
explosive device in Times Square. Indeed, many of these failed plots,
like those involving Najibullah Zazi and Faisal Shahzad, failed for want
of real explosives. This amount of plastic explosive would be enough to
construct a relatively small improvised explosive device if it wound up
in the hands of someone who wanted to use it violently, possessed a
detonator or two and had some basic explosives training, but it would
not be enough to create any large-scale damage by itself.

Robin Raphel=E2=80=94a former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan=E2=80=94had her c=
destroyed because the FBI suspected she was spilling secrets to the

speaking with Pakistani officials about speculation that there may be
a coup, information that the intelligence community deemed classified.
But speculation of a coup was prevalent in the Pakistani media and
within cross-government channels; all Raphel was doing was discussing
the issues of the day with her foreign counterparts.
Classification can also be abused to avoid oversight and wield power
over Congress. If you are a senator, unless you work on the
Intelligence Committee, are part of the leadership, or are the chair
or ranking member of the Foreign Relations or Armed Services
committees, your staff does not have the highest level of clearance.
Many executive branch briefings to members of Congress are at this
highest classification level, partially to protect information but
also to keep staff out. So, even if a member gains access to key
information that should be further investigated, she cannot share it
with anyone who works for her, making it nearly impossible to follow
up and exercise proper oversight.
This paucity of clearances stands in sharp contrast to the executive
branch, where thousands of people hold the highest level of clearance
and have easy access to facilities and computers that enable their
review of classified materials, and where millions of dollars are
invested annually in protecting and expanding these resources. On
Capitol Hill, there are few such facilities where classified
information can be discussed or worked on.
And yet, for all these security measures, major breaches via Edward
Snowden, Russian spying, or a Chinese heist of thousands of personnel
records continue.

In preparation for Ronald Reagan=E2=80=99s debate with President Jimmy Cart=
in the presidential race 1980, Reagan=E2=80=99s campaign staff acquired und=
mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including
information on Carter=E2=80=99s strategy, which staffers David Stockman and
David Gergen had used to prepare Reagan. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the
information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors
filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a
special investigation, based on the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.
Carter=E2=80=99s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White
House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any
law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own
investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan
staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan=E2=80=99s campaign direct=
William J. Casey, future head of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Will denied it, calling Carter "a recidivist liar."

Marvin Washington Brooks had been terribly ill for nearly three
months. A year prior in early-1952, he had been diagnosed with cancer
and had been admitted as =E2=80=9Ca patient for treatment=E2=80=9D to the U=
of Texas Medical School=E2=80=99s M.D. Anderson Hospital. Brooks had served=
 as
an infantryman in the Army during World War II. He had received a
Purple Heart for being wounded during the Battle of the Bulge. Not
long after he was admitted to the M.D. Anderson Hospital, Brooks began
to receive weekly treatment from a team of physicians led by an older
doctor with a heavy German accent and three distinctive scars across
his face. Brooks was told the treatment could significantly affect his
cancer in positive ways. But Brooks had become increasingly ill, with
constant vomiting, weight and hair loss, and patchy skin with large
areas appearing as if severely sunburned. Within about six months of
the weekly treatment, Brooks was in constant pain. He died the first
month of 1955, two days before what would have turned 47 years old.
Brooks was never informed that he was one of 263 cancer patients who
were secretly being experimented upon with =E2=80=9Cwhole body irradiation.=
Brooks, nor his wife or family, had ever been consulted about the
experiments. Nor had Brooks, or anyone else, given the hospital
permission to experiment on him. Nobody ever told Brooks, or anyone in
his family, that the German physician who saw him weekly was Dr.
Herbert Bruno Gerstner, a former Nazi doctor who had been secretly
brought to the United States in 1949.
Dr. Orlando Daumy, a radiologist and president of the Cuban Cancer
Association, traveled to Puerto Rico to examine him. From his direct
physical examination of Albizu Campos, Dr. Daumy reached three
specific conclusions:
1) that the sores on Albizu Campos were produced by radiation burns
2) that his symptoms corresponded to those of a person who had
received intense radiation,
3) that wrapping himself in wet towels was the best way to diminish
the intensity of the rays.

It is a misfortune that the Soviet people didn't immediately rise up
and overthrow their government after the compounded failures and

They only rose up and overthrew their government when it wasn't even
capable of conducting a coup. That's, that's... pretty incompetent.

CELINE'S LAWS
                      by  Hagbard Celine
   As  every thinking person has noticed, our national  life  has
become increasingly weird and surrealistic.  The waiting lines at
banks  and  post offices are growing longer all  the  time,  even
though  demographers tell us US population is no  longer  rising.
The  street  signs more often than not say WALK on  the  red  and
DON"T  WALK  on  the  green.  You can't  get  a  plumber  on  the
weekends.  Nobody has been able to explain the cattle mutilations
yet.   Every survey shows that the price of consumer  goods,  the
number  of violent crimes, and the eerie popularity of  THE  GONG
SHOW are ominously accelerating.
   I  believe  I  have found the  explanation  these  distressing
trends.   Needless to say, I cannot present, in a short  article,
all  the  evidence which I have accumulated in three  decades  of
careful  metasociological research; that will have to  await  the
publication  of  my three-volume study, "Why Everybody  Is  Going
Bonkers."   Here  I  can  only mention  the  thousands  of  depth
interviewws,   the   innumerable  flowcharts   and   helix-matrix
equations,  the  vast  files of computer readouts,  the  I  CHING
divinations,  and  other rigorous scientific techniques  used  in
developing  what I modestly call Celine's Laws of Chaos,  Discord
and Confusion.
   Celine's  First  Law is that National Security  is  the  chief
cause of national insecurity!
That may sound like a paradox, but I will explain it at one.
   Every secret police agency must be monitored by an elite corps
of secret-police-of-the-second-order.  There are numerous reasons
for this, but three are especially noteworthy.
NATIONAL SECURITY IS THE CHIEF CAUSE OF NATIONAL INSECURITY!!!
1).  Infiltration  of  the  secret police,  for  the  purpose  of
subversion,   will   always   be  a  prime   goal   of   internal
revolutionaries.  This is an ordinary part of the  spy-counterspy
game.   There  is nothing Weather Underground would  like  better
than having a few agents in the FBI or CIA, for the same  reasons
that  the FBI or CIA would like to have a few agents  in  Weather
2).   Such  infiltration  will also be a prime  goal  of  hostile
foreign powers, for the same reasons.
   Please  note that these are simple facts of the  secret-police
game, well-known even to the general public, the subject of  many
ingenious  plots  in  popular spy  films,  and  not  particularly
alarming...yet.    Nonetheless,  the  seeds  of  Chaos,  Discord,
Confusion,  and Paranoia are already here, for the simple  reason
that  once  a  human  being develops  the  habits  of  worry  and
suspicion,  he  or she finds increasing justifications  for  more
worry and more suspicion.  For instance, Richard Q. (not his real
initial),  one of my interview subjects, became concerned,  after
ten  years  in the CIA, with the possibility of  infiltration  by
"extraterrestrial"  agents.   He was eventually retired  when  he
began  to  claim that demons in the form of dogs  wanted  him  to
assassinate Laverne and Shirley.
3).   Secret-police  officials acquire  fantastic  capacities  to
blackmail and intimidate others in goverment.
   Stalin  executed three chiefs of his secret police in  a  row,
because  of this danger.  One of my informants claims that  every
president since the National Security Act was passed in 1947  has
learned  how to have sexual intercourse without making  a  single
audible sound, because of the possible electronic  eavesdroppers.
As Nixion says so wistfully on the Watergate transcripts,  "Well,
Hoover performed.  He would have fought.  That was the point.  He
would  have  defied a few people.  He would have scared  them  to
death.   HE HAS A FILE ON EVERYBODY!" .  Thus,  those
who  employ secret-police organizations MUST monitor them  th  be
sure they are not acquiring too much power.
   In  the United States today, the superelite that monitors  the
CIA  is the National Security Agency. ( And a group  called  "The
Store" monitors the NSA).
   Here  is  where a sinister infinite regress enters  the  game.
Any  such elite, second or third order secret-police agency  must
be, according to the above pragmatic and necessary rules, subject
to infiltration by native subversives or hostile foreign  powers,
or  to acquiring "too much power" in the opinion of its  masters.
(It  may  even  be  subject, if Richard Q.  was  correct  in  his
anxieties,  to extraterrestrial manipulation).  And so, it,  too,
must be monitored by a secret police of the third order.
    But this third-order secret-police (such as Nixon's notorious
"plumbers",  or more currently, "The Store"). is also subject  to
infiltration  or  to acquiring too much  power...and  thus,  with
relentless logic, the infinite regress builds.  Once a  goverment
has  n  orders  of secret police spying on each  other,  all  are
potentially suspect, and to be safe a secret police of order  n+1
must be created.  And so on, forever.
* THUS WHO EMPLOY SECRET                 *
* POLICE MUST MONITOR THEM TO            *
* BE SURE THEY ARE NOT ACQUIRING         *
* TOO MUCH POWER.                        *
   In  practice,  of  course,  this  cannot  really  regress   to
infinity,  but  only to the point where every other  citizen,  or
until the funding runs out, whichever comes first.
   National Security in practice, then, must always fall short of
the  logically  ideal  infinite regress which we  have  shown  is
necessary  to the achievement of its goal.  In that  gap  between
the  ideal  of "One nation under survillance, with  wiretaps  and
mail  covers for all" andthe strictly limited real  situation  of
finite funding, there is ample encouragement for paranoias of all
sorts  to  flourish.   In short, every  government  that  employs
secret-police agencies must grow more insecure, not more  secure,
as  the  strength, versatility, and power  of  the  secret-police
agencies grow.
   For  instance, a certain left-wing nation which  has  employed
secret-police  agencies  for 61 years has now reached  the  point
where  the  leaders  are terrified of  painters  and  poets.   In
another, right-wing nation infested with secret-police  agencies,
several  purges  have been caused by three practical  jokers  who
regularly  call  middle-rank officials on the phone and  talk  in
what appears to be a code.  The secret police, of course, are  no
fools,  and  are aware that this might be what it in fact  is,  a
form of anarchist humor; but they can't be sure.
   What  usually  happens  in such cases  is  this:  an  official
receives  one  of these mystery calls, saying  perhaps  "Pawn  to
queen rook five. No wife, no horse, no mustache.  A boy has never
wept  nor  dashed  a thousand kim."  He  knows  immediately  that
surveillance upon him will be increased tenfold.  In the next few
days,   while  memories  of  all  his  mistakes,  small   bribes,
incautious  remarks,  and other incriminating  events  haunt  his
imagination,  he observes the increased surveillance, and  begins
to  suspect even the most loyal of his subordinates  of  watching
him  with  eyes  that  miss  nothing  and  to  give  a   sinister
interpertation  to  everything.   Within  ten  days,  he  usually
attempts  to  contact  a  foreign  goverment  to  seek  political
sanctuary, and the secret-police net closes on him.
   By  the  same  process  of worry leading  to  more  worry  and
suspicion  leading to more suspicion, the very act of  joining  a
ecret-police  organization will eventually turn a man  or  woman
into a clinical paranoi; in layman's terms, "bananas" or  "wigged
out."   THE AGENT KNOWS WHOM HE IS SPYING ON; BUT HE NEVER  KNOWS
WHO IS SPYING ON HIM!  Could it be his wife, his girl friend, his
secretary, the newsboy, the Good Humor man?
   For these reasons, secret-police agents develop elaborate  and
complex  theories  to  account for what  is  actually  going  on.
According  to  one  of my tables of data, there  isn't  a  single
theory  held  by professional conspiracy buffs which  isn't  also
believed  by many members of our various secret-police  agencies.

   Now, Table 1 clearly gives a picture of a rather  schizzed-out
nation.   This is the result of the impossible  infinite  regress
and its resultant of worry leading to more worry.
   Furthermore, if there is a secret police at all, in any nation
you  care  to  imagine,  every  branch  and  department  of  that
country's government becomes suspect, in the eyes of cautious and
intelligent people, as a possible  front or funnel to the  secret
police.   (That is, the more shrewd citizens will recognize  that
something  titled a branch of the HEW or even PTA might  actually
be  run by the CIA).  Inevitably, the government as a whole,  and
many  nongovernmental  agencies, will be regarded  by  reasonable
persons  with fear and trepidation.  Proverbs like "One can't  be
too  careful  these days" and "Better safe than sorry"  become  a
kind of sinister folk wisdom.
   But  further  yet: any government which already has  a  secret
police  (and a secret police monitoring the secret police,  etc).
will   become  alarmed  on  observing  that  its  more  hip   and
intelligent citizens now regard it with loathing and  misgivings.
The government will therefore increase the size and powers of the
secret  police.   This  is the only  rational  move,  within  the
context of the secret-police game.
* SOMETHING PASSING AS A     *
* BRANCH OF HEW MIGHT BE A   *
* FRONT FOR THE CIA!         *
   (The  only  alternative was once  suggested  sarcastically  by
playwright  Bert  Brecht, who said, "If  the  government  doesn't
trust  the  people, why does'nt it dissovle them  and  elect  new
people?"  No way has yet been invented to elect a new people;  so
the  police  state will instead spy on the existing  people  even
more vigorously).
   This,  of  course,  creates additional paranoia  in  both  the
governors  and  the citizens, because  a  suffciently  pugnacious
secret  police  will  eventually  "have  a  file  on  everybody,"
including  its  own  creators.  This leads  to  another  infinite
regress:  the  more people will loathe the government,  the  more
power will be given to the secret police.
   Thus,  whether any of the hypothetical conspiracies  mentioned
earlier  really exist or not, a system of  clandestine  goverment
inevitably produces, in both the rulers and the ruled, a mood  of
paranoia in which such conspiracy theories flourish.
   This escalating sense of suspiciousness is accelerated by  the
fact  that every secret-police organization engages in  both  the
collection  of  information and  the  production  misinformation.
That  is,  you  score points in the secret-police  game  both  by
hoarding  signals (information units)---that is, by hiding  facts
from  competitive players---and by foisting false  signals  (fake
information  units)  on  the other  players.   This  creates  the
situation which I call Optimum Fuckup, in which every participant
has  rational  (not neurotic) cause to suspect that  every  other
player may be attempting to deceive him, gull him, con him,  dupe
him, and generally misinform him.  As Henry Kissinger is  rumored
to  have  said,  "Anybody  in Washington  these  days  who  isn't
paranoid is crazy!"
   One  could generalize the remark: anyone in the United  States
today who isn't paranoid must be crazy!!!
* "IF THE GOVERMENT DOESN'T      *
* TRUST THE PEOPLE, WHY DOESN'T  *
* IT DISSOLVE THEM AND ELECT A   *
* NEW PEOPLE?"                   *
   The   deliberate   production  of   misinformation   (or,   as
intelligence    agencies    more   euphemistically    call    it,
disinformation)  creates a situation profoundly  disorienting  to
the philosopher, the scientist, and the ordinary Joe who wants to
know  the  best time to go to the bank.  The desire  to  discover
"what-the-hell-is-really-going-on"  (the  definition  of  science
offered  by  physicist Saul-Paul Sirag) is  totally  incompatible
with  the circulation of disinformation; we all need to know,  at
least roughly, what the hell is really going on if we are not  to
stumble around like blind robots colliding with things we weren't
told were there.
   Maybe  the  UFO's  really  exist---or  maybe  the  whole   UFO
phenomenon is a cover for an intelligence operation.  Maybe there
are  black  holes  where space and time  implode---or  maybe  the
entire  black-hole cosmology was created to befuddle and  mislead
Russian scientists.  Maybe Jimmy Carter really exists---or  maybe
he  is,  as the National Lampoon claims, an  actor  named  Sidney
Goldfarb specially trained to project the down-home virtues  that
the  American people nostalgically seek.  Perhaps only three  men
at  the  top  of the National Security Angency  REALLY  know  the
answers  to  these questions---or perhaps those three  are  being
deceived by certain subordinates (as Lyndon Johnson was  deceived
by  the CIA about Vietnam) and are as disoriented as the rest  of
us. Such is the logic of a Disinformation Matrix.
   Personally, I find it easier to believe in UFO's than in black
holes  or Jimmy Carter; but that may just indicate the damage  to
my  own brain caused by the Optimum Fuckup of the  Disinformation
   According  to  a recent survey 19 per cent of  the  population
believe  the  moon landings were faked by Stanley Kubrick  and  a
gang of special effects experts.  Perhaps these archskeptics  are
the  sanest  ones left among us.  Who among the readers  of  this
file  has a security clearance high enough to be ABSOLUTELY  sure
that these ultraparanoids are wrong?
   This  general  tendency toward chaos discord,  and  confusion,
once  a  secret police has been established, is  complicated  and
accelerated   by   Celine's  Second  Law,   to   wit:   "Accurate
communication  is  only possible in  a  nonpunishing  situation."
This is a very simple statement of the obvious, and means no more
than  that  everybody  tends to lie a little, to  flatter  or  to
protect  themselves, when dealing with those who have power  over
them, especially the power to punish.  (this is why communication
between parents and children is notoriously befoolzled).
   Every authoritarian structure can be visualized as a  pyramid,
with  very few at the top and very many at the bottom, as in  the
flowchart  of  any  corperation or bureaucracy.   On  each  rung,
participants  bear  a burden of nescience in  relation  to  those
above them.  That is, they must be very, very careful that  their
natural  sensory activities as conscious organisms---the acts  of
seeing,  hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, drawing  inferences
from  perception,  etc.---be in accord with the wishes  of  those
above  them.  This is absolutely vital; job security  depends  on
it.   It  is much less important---a luxury that  can  easily  be
discarded---that  these  perceptions  be in  accord  with  actual
* COMMUNICATION IS ONLY *
* BETWEEN EQUALS.       *
   For instance, in the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, the agent  had
to  develop  the capacity to see godless  communists  everywhere.
Any  agent whose perceptions indicated that there  were  actually
very  few  godless  communists  anywhere  in  this  country  wold
experience  what psychologists call cognitive dissonance: his  or
her  reality grid was at variance with the official reality  grid
of  the  pyramidal  authority  structure.   To  talk  about  such
divergent  perceptions  at all would be to invite  suspicions  of
eccentricity, of intellectual wiseacreing, or of being oneself  a
godless  communist.   The  same  would  apply  to  any  Dominican
Inquisitor  of earlier centuries who lacked the capacity  to  see
witches  everywhere.   In such authoritarian  situations,  it  is
important  to see what the authorities see; it  is  inconvenient,
and possibly dangerous, to see what is actually there.
   But this leads to an equal and opposite burden of  omniscience
on  those  at the top, in the Eye of the  authoritarian  pyramid.
All  that  is forbidden to those at  the  bottom---the  conscious
activities  of perception andand evaluation---is demanded of  the
master classes, the elite and the super-elite.  They must attempt
to do the seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling,  thinking,
and decisionmaking for the whole society.
   But  a man with a gun (the power to punish) is told only  what
his  target thinks will not cause him to pull the  trigger.   The
elite,  with  their burden of omniscience, face  the  underlings,
with  their  burden  nescience, and  receive  only  the  feedback
consistent  with their own preconceived notions.  The  burden  of
omniscience becomes, in short, another and more complex burden of
nescience.  Nobody really knows anything anymore, or if they  do,
they are careful to hide the fact.
   As  the national security paradigm approaches (or attempts  to
approach)  the ideal infinite regress  of  spies-spying-on-spies-
spying-on-spies,  etc., the resultant general trepidation  causes
all  persons to hide anything they know (if it differs  from  the
official reality), not only from their superiors, but from  peers
and inferiors as well.  Anybody, after all, might be part of  the
nth-degree secret police.  "One can't be too careful these days."
The  burden of nescience becomes omnipresent.  More and  more  of
reality becomes unspeakable.
   But  as  Freud  noted, that  which  is  objectively  repressed
(unspeakable) soon becomes subjectively repressed  (unthinkable).
Nobody likes to feel like a coward and a liar constantly.  It  is
easier to cease to notice where the official reality grid differs
from  sensed experience.  Thus Optimun Fuckup  gradually  becomes
Terminal  Fuckup, and rigiditus bureaucraticus  sets in; this  is
the last stage before all brain activity ceases, and the  society
is intellectually dead.
   Celine's Third Law is like unto the first two, and holds  that
AN HONEST politician is a national calamity.
   At  first  glance,  this seems preposterous.   People  of  all
shades  of opinion agree that at least on the axiom that we  need
more honest politicians, not more crooked ones.  Please remember,
however,  that people of all shades of opinion once  agreed  that
the Earth is flat.
   Your  typical dishonest politician (bocca grande normalis)  is
interested  only  in enriching himself at the public  expense,  a
goal  he  shares  with most of his  fellow  citizens,  especially
doctors  and  lawyers.  This is normal behavior for  our  primate
species,  and society has always been able to endure and  survive
* NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING, OR IF *
* THEY DO, THEY ARE CAREFUL TO *
* HIDE THE FACT!               *
   An  honest  politician (bocca grande giganticus) is  far  more
dangerous.  He or she is sincerley commited to bettering  society
by  political  action.  In practice, that means  by  writing  and
enacting  more laws.  Indeed, many groups of idealistic  citizens
publish  rating sheets on politicians every year, and  those  who
have created more laws are estimated as having higher value  than
those  who are frequently absent when bills are voted upon.   The
assumption  is  that  adding  more laws to  statute  books  is  a
positive achievement, like adding more money to our paychecks  or
more art works to a museum.
   A  little thought, however, shows that this assumption is  not
tenable.   Every  law  creates a whole new  criminal  class;  for
instance, when marijuana was illegalized in 1937, several hundred
thousand   formerly   law-abiding   citizens   became   criminals
overnight, by Act of Congress.  As more and more laws are passed,
more and more citizens become criminals.  The chief cause of  the
rising crime rate is the rising number of laws being enacted.  An
honest   politician,  who keeps his nose to  the  grindstone  and
enacts several hundred laws in the course of his career, thereby
produces as many as several million new criminals.
   It  is furthermore mathematically demonstrable that  the  more
laws there are, the more restrictions there are on the freedom of
the  individual.  If there were, say, only three laws in a  given
society---e.g.,  Thou shalt not kill; thau shalt not steal;  thou
shalt not lie or defraud---there would be only three restrictions
on freedom, which all rational persons would accept as  obviously
necessary  to the maintenance of order.  When there  are  several
hundred thousand restrictions on freedom, most of which are  felt
as extremely irksome by large segments of the populace.
   In  fact,  it would take a brigade of lawyers  several  weeks,
minutely  examining  your  affairs, to determine  if  you  are  a
criminal.   Certainly,  no  ordinary  citizen  has  the  time  or
research facilities to discover if he or sshe is in violation  of
one out of skillions of laws currently on our statute books.   In
many  cases,  two  lawyers  consulted  independently  will   give
opposite  opinions about whether or not a given course of  action
is in violation of the statutes.
   And  new  laws  are being enacted all  the  time.   Obviously,
unless  there is a sudden paper shortage, the number of  laws  on
the books will eventually reach the point satirized by T.H.White,
in  which  "everything not prohibited is compulsory."   It  would
then  probably only take a few years or decades more for a  cadre
of honest politicians diligently writing even more laws to  reach
the  complementary  point  where "everything  not  compulsory  is
* EVERY LAW CREATES A WHOLE     *
* NEW CRIMINAL CLASS OVERNIGHT! *
   At  that  stage the nightmare world of Orwell's 1984  will  be
achieved.   Crooked politicians, merely interested in the  normal
human  activity of making themselves rich and comfortable,  could
never  create  that ultimate horror; but  honest  and  idealistic
politicians  bring us closer to it every day, with every new  law
they enact.
   These three generalizations---that national security  produces
national     insecurity;    that    authoritarianism     produces
miscommunication and eventual idiocy; and that honest politicians
are  a plague upon society---will be found to fully  explain  the
Decline  and  Fall of Rome, the Decline and Fall of  the  British
Empire, and the Decline and Fall of any country you care to name.

Our mighty civilization strives for the production of commodities as
impermanent as possible in packaging as permanent as possible. The
impermanent product must soon be replaced by a new one, and this is
good for the economy; the permanence of the packaging, on the other
hand, makes its disposal difficult, and this promotes the further

I believe that a significant shift in the relationship between public
and deep state power occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in
the Reagan Revolution of 1980. In this period five presidents sought
to curtail the powers of the deep state. And as we shall see, the
political careers of all five=E2=80=94Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and
Carter=E2=80=94were cut off in ways that were unusual. One president, Kenne=
was assassinated. Another, Nixon, was forced to resign.
To some extent the interplay of these two forms of power and political
organization is found in all societies. The two were defined by Hannah
Arendt in the 1960s as =E2=80=9Cpersuasion through arguments=E2=80=9D versu=
s =E2=80=9Ccoercion
by force.=E2=80=9D Arendt, following Thucydides, traced these to the common
Greek way of handling domestic affairs, which was persuasion (=CF=80=CE=B5=
as well as the common way of handling foreign affairs, which was force
and violence (=CE=B2=CE=AF=CE=B1)." The two represent not just different te=
of government but different cultures and mindsets, in fundamental
tension with each other.
This tension increases, and predictably tips toward violence, if a
well-organized open community expands beyond its own borders and is
increasingly occupied with the business of supervising an empire. It
is repeatedly the case that progressive societies (like America)
expand. As their influence expands, their democratic institutions,
based at bottom upon persuasive power among equals, are supplemented
by new, often secret, institutions of top-down violent power for the
control of alien populations abroad, often speaking different and
unfamiliar languages. The more the society expands, the more these
institutions of violent power encroach upon and supplant the original

predecessors. And although the manner of his occupying the kingdom was
irregular and odious, none the less had he observed the ancient
institutions of the other Kings, he would have been tolerated, and the
Senate and Plebs would never have arisen against him and taken the
State away from him. This man, therefore, was not driven out because
of his son Sextus having violated Lucretia, but for having broken the
laws and governed it (his Kingdom) tyrannically; having taken away all
authority from the Senate and assumed it himself, and those funds
which were marked for public improvements with which the Roman Senate
was satisfied, he diverted to the building of his own palace, with
disgust and envy for him resulting. So that in a very short time, he
despoiled Rome of all that liberty which she had maintained under the
other previous Kings. And it was not enough for him to make the
Fathers (Senators) his enemies, but he aroused the Plebs against
himself, working them hard in mechanical labor and all unlike those
which his predecessors had employed. So that by having filled Rome
with such cruel and haughty examples of his, he had already disposed
the minds of all the Romans to rebellion whenever they should have the
opportunity. And if the incident of Lucretia had not happened, even so
another would have arisen which would have produced the same result:
For if Tarquin had lived like the other Kings and his son Sextus had
not made that error, Brutus and Collatinus would have had recourse to
Tarquin for vengeance against Sextus, and to the Roman People.
Princes should understand, therefore, that they begin to lose the
State from that hour when they begin to break the laws and ancient
institutions under which men have lived for a long time. And if as
private citizens, having lost the State, they should ever become so
prudent to see with what facility Principalities are kept by those who
are counselled wisely, they would regret their loss much more, and
would condemn themselves to greater punishment than that to which
others have condemned them: For it is much more easy to be loved by
the good than the bad, and to obey the laws then to enforce them. And
in wanting to learn the course that they should have to hold to do
this, they do not have to endure any other hardship than to mirror for
themselves the lives of good Princes, such as Timoleon the Corinthian,
Aratus the Sicyonian, and similar ones, in the lives of whom they
would find as much security and satisfaction to him who ruled as to he
who is ruled; so that they ought to want to imitate him, being able to
do so for the reasons mentioned: For men when they are well governed,
do not seek or desire any other liberty; as happened to the people
governed by the above named (Princes), whom they constrained to be
Princes as long as they lived, even though they often had been tempted
to return to private life.
And as in this and the two preceding chapters, there has been
discussed the dispositions aroused against Princes, and of the
Conspiracy made by the sons of Brutus against their country, and of
those made against Tarquinius Priscus and Servius Tullus, it does not
appear to me to be something outside this subject to speak at length
of them in the following chapter, being a matter worthy of being noted
by Princes and Private Citizens.
OF CONSPIRACIES
And it does not appear proper to me to omit the discussion of
Conspiracies, being a matter of so much danger to Princes and Private
Citizens. For it is seen that many more Princes have lost their lives
and States through them, than by open war. For it is conceded only to
a few to be able to make open war against a Prince, but the ability to
conspire against them is conceded to everyone. On the other hand,
private citizens do not enter in an enterprise more perilous nor more
foolhardy than this, as it is difficult and most dangerous in all of
its parts. Whence it happens that many are attempted, and very few
have the desired ending. So that, therefore, Princes may learn to
guard themselves from these dangers, and that Private Citizens may
less rashly engage in them, and rather may learn to live contentedly
under the Rule that has been assigned to them by chance and by their
state, I shall speak widely, not omitting any notable case, in
documenting the one and the other. And truly that sentence of
Cornelius Tacitus is golden, which says that men have to honor things
past but obey the present, and ought to desire good Princes, but
tolerate the ones they have. And truly, whoever does otherwise, most
of the time will ruin himself and his country.
We ought, therefore, ((in entering on this matter)) to consider first
against whom conspiracies are made, and we will find them to be made
either against a country or against a Prince. It is of these two that
I want us to discuss at present; for those which are made to give a
town over to the enemy who besiege it, or that have some reason
similar to this, have been talked about above sufficiently. And in
this first part we shall treat of that against a Prince, and first we
will examine the reasons for it, which are many, but there is one
which is more important than all the others: and this is his being
hated by the general public; for in the case of that Prince who has
aroused this universal hatred, it is reasonable (to suppose) that
there are some particular individuals who have been injured by him
more (then others) and who desire to avenge themselves. This desire of
theirs is increased by that universal ill disposition that they see is
aroused against him. A Prince ought therefore to avoid these public
charges, but I do not want to talk here ((having treated of this
elsewhere)) of what he should do to avoid them. For by guarding
himself against this (hatred), the simple offenses against particular
individuals will make less war against him: One, because rarely is a
man met who thinks so much of an injury that he will put himself in so
much danger to avenge it: The other, even if they should be of a mind
and power to do so, they are held back by that universal benevolence
that they see the Prince to have. Injuries that happen to an
individual are of Possessions (taking them from him), of Blood
(physical injury), or of Honor. Of those of Blood, threats are most
dangerous, and there is no peril in the execution, because he who is
dead cannot think of vengeance, and those who remain alive most of the
time leave such thoughts to the dead: but he who is threatened, and
sees himself constrained by necessity either to act or to suffer,
becomes a most dangerous man for the Prince, as we shall relate in
detail in its place. Outside of this necessity, those (injuries) of
Possession and Honor, are matters that harm men more than any other
offense, and against which the Prince ought to guard himself, for he
can never despoil one so much that he does not leave a mind obstinate
to vengeance. And of (injuries) of honor, that are inflicted on men,
that against their women is most important, and after that, insult to
their person. This (kind of injury) armed Pausanias against Phillip of
Macedonia: this has armed many others against many other Princes: and
in our times, Julio Belanti would not have set in motion a conspiracy
against Pandolfo, Tyrant of Siena, except that the latter had given
him a daughter for his wife, and then took her away, as we will relate
in its place. The major cause that made the Pazzi conspire against the
Medici, was the inheritance of Giovanni Borromei, which was taken from
the former by the latter.

America is the greatest empire to grace the face of the Earth.
If there is evidence to the contrary, it ought to be ignored.
The idea that it is a laughing matter that a senile buffoon might be
the Democratic nominee is somewhat baffling considering criticisms of
Trump. But no one really made arguments on principle, it is just to
dunk on the other side.
There are benefits to being the greatest empire, when Americans say
America, people know they aren't referring to the continent, when
Americans are wronged, our government redresses their concerns, when
we travel abroad, everyone accepts American cash. We attract the
greatest thinkers, the greatest doers, because that is America.
Of course there will always be cliques of people who will think others
are gross and rather not deal fairly with them, but prevailing
circumstances will always dictate concerns.

@_subject: Dysfunctional Decision-making 
Every society is run by an increasingly small number of cynical
decision-makers. Barring a change of circumstance where cynicism is
discouraged, their actions and plans are ultimately rewarded, and more
power is accrued to them. Success begets success.
Secrecy and immorality is incompatible with a free society, a free
press is necessary to provide the necessary information for which
society's members can decide the direction society may go. However if
the response to a given event is to claim that it isn't happening,
this constrains the freedom of action by which society's leaders can
devote resources to an issue.
Furthermore, it is the interests of cynical decision-makers in the
accrual of power to alter society so that various leaders are cowardly
and so unlikely to take an unprecedented action. Organizations that
operate in accordance to inertia can be easily predicted and
deviations from a course can be noticed and responded to accordingly.
This is paradoxically incompatible with long-term stability, the
people who desire access to the levers of power do not disappear, and
if they did, cynical decision-makers do not make up a majority of
society's members, they themselves are constrained from making public
decisions or actions that would in it self be threatening and lead to
a reaction by society's leaders to effect their removal out of a
desire for self-preservation (unless it was sufficiently clear that
ambition was not synonymous with hazard).
Thus even the response to threats to a political order is constrained
by perceptions, and this in turn constrains the allocation of
resources to respond. The press, if dedicated to preserving the
current political order, cannot describe a threat to the political
order in terms that would allow for the threat to expand in support
beyond society itself is willing to provide in responding to it.
Every lock has play. The only lock that cannot be picked is one that
cannot be opened.

The Wuhan Flu can't be a bioweapon, it would be too absurd and stupid
for anyone to weaponize a contagious disease when warfare itself is a
dissolution of borders where nothing can be contained and everyone can
potentially be impacted equally.
As a private citizen, I think it absurd that Wuhan, the provincial
capital of Hubei, can't be mentioned when their own fellow Chinese in
Jiangxi distrust the Hubei police in regulating the flow of people
between provinces. To quote Thomas Jefferson: "To give praise which is
not due might be well from the venal, but would ill beseem those who
are asserting the rights of human nature."
I do not think that leadership involves much ability, it is mostly
cutting checks and telling people to do the obvious. I do believe in
free speech, wherever, including in the bedrooms, but ill-mannered
statements on certain topics should be a disqualifier for being in
certain positions of trust, or at least require checks against
potentially harmful decisions. It is unclear why genuine and valid
criticisms of authority has become so scarce.
I seriously hate you all, but not in that way, and hope everyone can
mutually respect each other.
