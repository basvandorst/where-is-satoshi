The Company:
Located in Boca Raton, FL, Synergy Software Development Inc. is a secure applications software development business specializing in healthcare and other niche technologies. Synergy’s advanced clinical information technology was developed specifically for use by hospitals, physician groups, private practitioners and other healthcare providers. SGYS created the first enterprise management software for the Internet and is a proven leader in providing security over all types of network and infrastructure systems. Synergy’s development partners include: Sun Microsystems, Netscape, Microsoft, RSA, IBM and Silicon Graphics.
The Opportunity:
Fueled by skyrocketing administrative costs, the need to comply with government mandates and regulations and the rising demand for Internet portals have created an unique opportunity for SGYS to capitalize on its services. Pressure by health insurers, employers and government payers to control rising costs while improving access to quality care is causing a dramatic shift in the industry.

The compliance costs for health care organizations are substantial and are driving demand for IT outsourcing solutions. SGYS’s management believes that the huge demand for new healthcare support solutions coupled with the movement toward Internet technology places Synergy in an ideal place at the right time.
Healthcare is behind every other industry on migrating to the Internet and it is 1/7th of our entire economy. Synergy’s strategy can provide access to over 20 million covered lives and 200,000 physicians. Management will be constantly challenged to attract new members and exploit all value-added revenue opportunities.
