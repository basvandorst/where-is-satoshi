I think the role of Cryptome would be better served by someone who actually wants to use cryptography to secure content delivery. Call me crazy...

Cue claims i've been deluded by the CA cabal or don't understand SSL/TLS attacks. I don't care. Fuck your plaintext
Calling bullshit. Mirimirs right, explanation makes no sense. And JYA says netsol won't let him delete the logs but Netsol says logs are disabled by default[ and you have to turn them on.
So how the fuckd this really happen?
Mirimir  Are you arguing that users could have found those logs?
I almost can't imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewhere,
and I can't imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can't imagine
how Cryptome archives would have included anything from /var/log/, even
after system restore from backups.
But that's the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how would
the "NetSol total restore" have changed that?
I still don't get how logs would have ended up in archives. Maybe JYA
prepared a special set of archives for a collaborator. Maybe for someone
helping him to understand what had happened. And then maybe he forgot
about doing that. Hard to say.

NetSol is a bundle of contradictions, the essence of ISPs.
We have always logged the actions of our ISPs and their ISPs,
upstream and downstream, services and support, security and vulns.
So too mail lists, SM, chats, as instructed by this forum and its many
offshoots working all sides, warning of perfidy to hide perfidy.
Check those links we posted about how the spies work this fertile
terrain of paranoia and over-confidence, feeding the wired and wireless
news machine, advertisers and officials, now cybersecurity being
ratcheted up to WMD level. Coders as glamorous as physicists.
Nobels and MacArthurs acoming. And the opportunist anti-coders
smelling the coffee of protests. Cryptographers facing the opprobrium
of WMD-makers when the public grasps what fools they have been
taken for through the same old scam, public protection requires
ever greater national secrecy among the select. Unbreakable crypto
then declared illegal everywhere, and only cryptographers know
what unbreakable means: smoke and mirrors, lots of mirrors.

1. JYA said it was Netsol, were working with his scant informatin

your error is assuming there are only two parties in this equation:
JYA and netsol.
your secondary fallacy involves netsol as solitary, singular entity of
one action and awareness.
how'd this not get fucked harder, is the question. (or did it? :)

So why does Netsol contradict JYA about the log settings?

Someone made a mistake. Best was initially assumed full of shit by JYA, as he's a neophyte - and is consistently 'off-message' for this list.
Others, wishing to read more into it, other than face value of hubris, see plans within plans.
At the end of the day, Bests' disclosures amount to nothing of consequence. At best he overhyped them, being a neophyte. At worst he's JTRIGd the list, hilariously easily. The technical cognoscenti on the list stay quiet, "code compiling" as the good doctor says.
In general, this oversight is valuable because it demonstrates one thing:
Even if you try to delete it.
If there's a signal it will leak. Purposefully or not.
When the protocol you use doesn't provide metadata anonymity, don't expect it because you won't get it. If you don't understand this - keep studying.
Why guess at 'motivation'? Do we need to FUD yet another leaker site? Put your money where your mouth is - improve it, donate, write your own, fix the bug & plug the hole.

Maybe, but why those foldersmonths only? Itd be good to hear from JYA, especially b/c Netsol contradicts him.

I'm not sure what the links are meant to imply. That the log leak was a disruption effort by the GCHQ that was planted when NetSol restored the site?
