Important Info
"I Can Catch Him"
John, a local football star, is jogging down
the street when he sees a building on fire.
A lady is standing on a third story ledge holding her pet cat in her arms.
"Hey, lady," yells John, "Throw
me the cat."
"No," she cries, "It's too
"I play football, I can catch him."
The smoke is pouring from the windows, and
finally, the woman waves to John, kisses her cat goodbye, and tosses it down to the street.
John keeps his eye on the cat as it comes
hurtling down toward him. The feline bounces off an awning and John runs into the street to catch it. He jumps six
into the air and makes a spectacular one handed catch. The crowd that has
to watch the fire breaks into cheers.
John does a little dance, lifts the cat above his head, wiggles his knees back
and forth,
then spikes the cat into the pavement.
