 Not all ISPs are. I was referring to those of us who are both Common Carri=
ers and ISPs. The Common Carrier status will override.
I was speaking of TOR as a service. The service is not provided inherent of=
 the infrastructure to pass packets. It's more similar to a tunneling proto=
col service.
The person hosting the endpoint on their infrastructure would be the servic=
e point and they are the ones acting as protector and as such should take o=
n the responsibility as such. I can feel lawyers rubbing their hands togeth=
er as I type.

TOR is not vital. It is political. I view this not as an issue of morals or=
 political action. It is an issue of a technical nature. A TOR is a way to =
hide who you are. If I am hiding who you are from someone else and there is=
 a law broken, who do you go after?

This is ridiculous. Owen you damn well know that if you send packets from a=

You actually are saying what I said, just you misunderstand your own point.=
 You clipped my entire statement to make it appear to say something else.
A TOR node, in and of itself, is not infrastructure for passing packets. It=
's a service on the infrastructure. I never implied that the traffic throug=
h/from the ISP or the TOR was more or less legal than the other.
No they are not. See previous.

I know I'm going to get flamed and excoriated, but here goes....
This is a misleading statement. ISP's (Common carriers) do not provide a kn=
owingly illegal offering, AND they do provide the PHYSICAL infrastructure f=
or packets to be passed and interconnected to other PHYSICAL networks. TOR =
exit/entrance nodes provide only the former. The lack of providing a physic=
al infrastructure is crucial. Also, most ISP's (US specifically) are requir=
ed by Law (under subpoena) to provide details to law enforcement.
I really hate this idea of privacy on the Internet. If you really think you=
 have the "right" to use the public infrastructure (to whatever extent you =
want to label the Internet as such) and be completely anonymous, I have a b=
ridge to sell you. Network operators may treat your packets to whatever lev=
el of scrutiny that they may find necessary to determine if they want to pa=
ss your packets, keeping in mind that good operators want the Internet to w=
I'm waiting for the next hot "application" to use a widely known "bad" port=
 and see what happens. :)
I'm actually in agreement that law enforcement may have overstepped here if=
 the only reason was the TOR exit point, but having a TOR exit point to me,=
 seems to be condoning the actions/statements/packets used through the exit=
 point. You are knowingly hiding information that your local government may=
 require you to disclose.
Short answer... don't use TOR. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good th=
ing either.
