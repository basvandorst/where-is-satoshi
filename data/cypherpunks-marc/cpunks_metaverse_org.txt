Quoting Zenaan Harkness :
Seems the Ruby language community are having the same discussion. This   blog post  summarises the authors argument nicely against these contracts.
I quite like the argument that 'disagreeing is not nice'; we have the  threat that list members won't contribute to 'arguments' because  there's the risk they may be seen as harassing or not being 'nice',  when it should be accepted that respectful arguments are 'healthy' in  a community.
On the other hand, I can't see Cypherpunks agreeing to a 'code of  conduct', or adhering to it.

@_subject: Re: Qubes 
That's working as designed.. From the FAQ at       Can I install Qubes in a virtual machine (e.g., on VMware)?
Some users have been able to do this, but it is neither recommended nor supported. Qubes should be installed bare-metal. (After all, it uses its own bare-metal hypervisor!)
