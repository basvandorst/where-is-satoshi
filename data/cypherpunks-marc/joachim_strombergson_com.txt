I would like to humbly disagree. In case of MD6 the fix meant that a
bugger had to be doubled in size (according to the Fortify blog). This
means that the memory footprint and thus its applicability for embedded
platforms was (somewhat) effected.
That is, secure implementations might have different requirements than
what mighty have been stated, and we want to select an algorithm based
on the requirements for a secure implementation, right?

Hash: SHA1
(Slightly tangential but on topic I hope)
Am I the only surprised that the NSA designed block ciphers SIMON and
SPECK is vulnerable to differential attacks?
If I understand the history correctly NSA supported the development of
DES as well as SHA-0/SHA-1 and their contributions shows knowledge about
differential attacks at least as far back as 1977.

Hash: SHA1
If that is all you want, have you considered SipHash? It is much faster
than the other algorithms, yet more secure than CityHash, Murmurhash and
friends. And it provides an IV/salt to make it per instance unique.
Designed by DJB and Aumasson, the latter the designer of BLAKE and
BLAKE2 which you referred.
(Sorry to butt in and if I might have suggested something you already know.)

Or the NIST Randomness Beacon. Anybody tested it with Dieharder yet - or
is it too much of a dead duck anyway to not waste time on it.
