What is it?
OEM stands for "Original Equipment Manufacturer." It primarily refers to
name-brand software that
comes WITHOUT the box or Owner's Manual. Why do you
care? You can purchase OEM (even Microsoft and Adobe) and other
name-brand software, for unbelievably low
prices -- often much lower than from the original
manufacturer. Check out OEM today at following the link
