Gee, it's even in the cypherpunks archives. Sorry, everyone.
Yes, as described sure sounds similar. The point of doing it over PayPal
would just be to make it easy for people on this list to pay Nomen. Even
though hawala works in the real world, I'm not so sure we could just start
it and expect it to work here.
One thing that came to mind while reading about it -- does it buy us
anything in a MIX-net to separate control messages from payload messages?
This came to mind because one of the descriptions of the hawala network
seemed to imply that payment would come in from one source and then the
name of the recipient would come in from another.
The analogy in a MIX-net for e-mail would be having a message delivered to
a MIX, and then later forwarding instructions for that message delivered
by someone else. (said instructions identifying message by hash or
something). Another way to look at this is putting delay in the hands of
the client. Not clear to me that it helps; maybe make an adversary think a
certain node is the final destination? I can't think of a MIX design off
the top of my head which does this. Anyone else? something like this
discussed way back when?

The recent comments on Mojo Nation prompted me to look at their site
again. I don't see much guidance on how to set prices for network

pricing schemes on top of Mojo Nation, but not much indication of what
these schemes might be.
So what is the "right" way to price resources? (Preferably beyond the
obvious "supply and demand.")
Fleet announced at Hettinga's DCSB that they were developing some kind of
spare resource market. I couldn't make it. Does anyone know whether they
addressed this point?
A related question - I ran into a friend of mine who had just finished an
internship in options trading. He suggested it might be worth looking at
options on spare disk space or other resources, as a means of figuring out
how to make Mojo-type systems eventually profitable in the real world. Now

A friend of mine was considering a business plan for physical remailer+
"infomediary" for a class project a year or two ago. Precisely to get
around this problem. Sell learns the remailer's address. More than a few
remailers and you can chain them, etc. etc.
He was thinking about it in terms of the single proxy model, but if the
idea ever took off enough to have multiple competitors, you could try a
MIX-net. I don't think I ever pointed this out to him. I'll have to ask
him whatever came of the project.
Right - it's for optimizing load balancing and data distribution. Roughly
stated, it seems to me to be a DoS prevention mechanism. It's not at all
clear that Mojo will ever be meaningfully convertible to "real" money, at
least not to me. but then again, I'm often unclear.
and that in turn is a holdover from the old BBS days.
BBSes seem special in that the resources available are so *drastically*
limited. A BBS with one phone line could serve one user at a time. When
one person is on, nobody else has a shot. So a BBS without upload/download
ratios runs the risk of collapsing pretty quick under the weight of
leeches and m0es. When I ran a BBS, I ended up removing the files section
altogether; I thought messages were the most important part (and in any
case, didn't have a large enough HD to hold files...plus didn't want to
deal with the tension bewteen running a "free speech" BBS and screening
for pirate warez so as to not get arrested.) I think this accounted in
part for the obsession with "access level" which seemed common to many BBS
(On the other hand, I also gave everyone a 90 minute time quota; way more
than most people ever used. So perhaps this "quotas or die" doesn't hold
true universally. Anyone else have anecdotal evidence from BBSing? )
Anyway, the point is that in such a resource-limited environment, quotas
and ratios are basic rationing tools. Use them or die(mostly). When you
move to an environment which has more resources, things seem to change.
You can get away for longer with less in the way of resource control.
So the principle that "networks which reward providers of information
should flourish" may be tempered by less which selects for those networks
over others.

@_subject: Re: Pricing Mojo, Integrating PGP, TAZ, and D.C. Cypherpunks 
On the off chance that this isn't rhetorical, because at least one way of
doing this seems straightforward...
Some guy with a true name good enough to sign up for PayPal gets an
account, publishes a public key, and acts as a human "cash remailer."
Well, several people do, actually, and then we run a "payment MIX." Some
anonymous poster brought up the idea about a year ago IIRC and attributed
it to Ron Rivest. It sparked a short discussion which went into questions
of whether such an operation might run afoul of money laundering laws and
then sort of petered out. Or maybe I just stopped reading.
To spell it out, Nomen offers to do the service and picks an incoming
payment MIX plus a chain of MIXes. (N.B.: will use MIX to refer to a
member of the chain).  Publishes a "payment reply block" which has the
incoming payment MIX PayPal address in clear, plus a block encrypted with
the payment MIX's public key. The encrypted portion has the PayPal address
of the next MIX in the chain, plus an encrypted portion for that next MIX.
Eventually it decrypts to reveal Nomen's real PayPal account info.
Assuming everyone plays along, the money flows down the chain and ends up
in Nomen's PayPal account. I expect that's not such a great assumption
when dealing with "real" money.
You still have the BlackNet problem, though - Nomen1 and Nomen2 can both
publish public payment blocks. Which one do you pay? In this particular
case, though, you can address that (and the fair exchange problem) by
doing what Stephen King did -- Nomen does a little bit of the work first
for free, then continues iff enough people ante up for more. You use the
payment block signed by the same key which signed the current work.
Now that I think about it, you could probably take this down the route
Eric Hughes suggested in his "Universal Piracy Network" presentation at
DEF CON IV. That is, people pay Nomen and in return Nomen sends them the
new work first; they get 0-day access to the warezzz. Hughes had something
about "completion bonds" in his presentation as well, but I don't remember
at all what the particulars were, just that there was a rough analogy to
the movie industry. Anyone remember more details?
I have half a mind to sign up for PayPal just to try this. (Assuming I
won't be thrown in jail for money laundering, anyway). Anyone with me?
Nomen? :)
Although I feel compelled to point out that with only one MIX, it's not
going to be particularly secure for Nomen. Not to mention with no
provision for detecting MIXes who shave off the payment or eat it
entirely, this might just be me trying to make a few quick $$$. Of course
if this were large-scale, you could use reputations -- a MIX which eats
the entire $$$ now loses out on the possibility of shaving small fractions
of $$$ later.
Also, with provision for detecting MIXes who give good payments, there's
nothing to stop Nomen from alleging that I'm screwing him and ruining my
reputation. As a potential MIX, that bothers me. So there are issues here.
right, like the barter a Nomen is trying to do with Marc right now...and
which doesn't seem to be working too well so far. Although in that case it
seems like the problem was just that this Nomen set up the terms of the
barter without bothering to ask if the other party actually wanted to
trade. That's like this guy at Coney Island I met a few months back.
"You wanna throw a dart?? Here! Here! Free!"
"Now you owe me five dollar!"
(I paid. Yes, I'm a wuss. I got a cute fan out of it. I'm never doing
business like that at Coney Island ever again.)

@_subject: Re: Pricing Mojo, Integrating PGP, TAZ, and D.C. Cypherpunks 
Mojo Nation doesn't have to "sell" directly to consumers. In fact, as you
point out, it's not realistic to expect consumers to manage their own
pricing. On the other hand, this might be an opportunity for people to
build services on top of Mojo Nation. Such a "middle" service could
provide a consumer with a turnkey, flat fee, no hassle service, while
using Mojo Nation to obtain the most efficient prics possible for
resources. The difference between the flat fee and the "most efficient"
price provided by Mojo becomes the profit for the middle service.
I don't even know if this works in theory, however. Presumably I could set
up a model to investigate the relationship between "best possible" Mojo
prices and the characteristics of the network - things like how many
users, how much trading, liqudity, which pricing algorithms people use,
and so on. Then we could ask questions like "how many people need to be
offering which kinds of services before a service built on top of Mojo can
be profitable?"
The ideal situation would be one in which the middle service can undercut
"traditional" providers -- and still make money. Except that doesn't look
like it's going to happen in the real world. You've mentioned the fact
that not enough people are running Mojo clients ("thin
market"/"illiquid"). It's not clear what it would take to get more people
in the Mojo marketplace; even if the theory works out beyond my wildest
dreams and I could somehow "prove" that Mojo will make everyone money **if
only ten million people sign up tomorrow**, I suspect no one would pay
There are other problems as well. For one thing, who are the "traditional
providers" in the previous paragraph against whom a Mojo service would
compete? in markets for which resources? In the case of disk space, it
seems to be the people who make and sell hard drives; both entrenched and
selling physical goods which any middle service would be hard pressed to
emulate perfectly. Plus, as one of the anonymous posters noted, the disk
market is quite non-volatile (maybe "boring" is the right word) with a
pronounced trend downward; what is the incentive to use a Mojo-based
service there if the customer can just wait a week and then buy a bigger HD?
So are there markets for which a "middle service" could work?
I apologize for going on at length about this, but if you want Mojo to
correspond at all to real money instead of being a DoS protection
feature, I don't see many other ways than "middle services" to make it
work on a wide scale. Then again, I may just be lacking imagination.
Does anyone happen to know of real-world current examples like this, in
which some aggregator buys and sells a commodity on an exchange, then
turns around and offers it at a flat rate to end users?
Have you seen the SemioText(e) anthology? "TAZ" is in it, along with stuff
from J.G. Ballard, the Church of the Subgenius, stories vaguely inspired
by gnosticism, and other usual suspects. Reading it reminded me of reading
Douglas Rushkoff's _Cyberia_ for the first time -- another book which
gives new meaning to your "see where the degrees of freedom of the Web
will take us." Heady stuff, all of it, and now seems to be out of fashion,
but that's a tangent...

One way around this management issue might be to use a public-key
cryptosystem which supports "key blinding." (Note - A Google search
reveals that this term seems to be used in other places as well, and it
looks like the usage there is not quite consistent with the way it is used
in this message. Caveat lector.)
David Hopwood has done some amazing work on formalizing the concept, which
informally goes something like this:
A public-key cryptosystem supports "blinded keys" if there is an efficient
randomized algorithm which takes a public key PK and outputs a new public
key PK' such that
for this application, we also need something perhaps stronger
This is somewhat like Ross Anderson's "compatible weak keys," except that
it does not require that a new private key be created along with the new
public key.
With blinded keys, the management issue you mention becomes much simpler,
I think.  Instead of managing dozens of public-private key pairs, you have
only one pair (PK,SK). To create a one-use public key for the purpose of
status notification, you create a blinded key PK'. Anything encrypted with
PK' can be decrypted by your SK, but the key unlinkability properties
prevent the remailers from correlating messages based on PK'.
One way to create a key-blinded cryptosystem is to consider Elgamal public
keys as the pair (g, y), where y = g^x for private key x. Then to blind a
public key, pick a random blinding factor b and let the blinded key be
(g^b, y^b). With this, you do not need to keep track of the blinding
factor b; the change in generator to g^b will do that for you.  So you can
get away without keeping any state on your end beyond your private key x.
For more detail, currently the best thing to do is a groups.google.com
search for David Hopwood and "BRH-DHAES." We keep meaning to write this
up, but never get around to it.

I recently read _TAZ_ for the first time. It was on the shelf at St.
Mark's Bookshop here in NYC in the "Anarchism" section, I hadn't read it,
and I knew of it only from the Wagner/Goldberg paper.
Everyone go read it now!!
There are many other things in the "Anarchism" section of the St. Mark's
Bookshop in NYC, by the way. Should any list readers stop by the city,
check it out. The people browsing the section are more fun than the
section itself.
I knew about anarchism before I really knew about cryptography. Peter
Marshall's _A History of Anarchism_ was a present from parents who were
worried that the "anarchy club" at the local junior high might present the
wrong idea. (They figured drawing the libertine circled A was enough).
Later on Emma Goldman's essays proved valuable; those are reprinted and
available at the same bookshop. Both of these are no nonsense, no
bullshit, practical overviews of what anarchism is about...no hermenutics
Digression aside, Hakim Bey asks in _TAZ_ the question "where are my
turnips?" By this he means "when are computers going to deliver on the
revolutionary promise?" When will we be able to use computer networks to
exchange goods that people *actually care about* ? When will I be able to
trade something I have (knowledge about esoteric aspects of relativised
cryptography, say) for some concrete strange *physical* goods I want
(Cuban hallucenogenic fruits, controlled substances, organic turnips)?
(See, the information-only goods don't count. they're not REAL ENOUGH.
Besides, what kind of revolution is it when the only benefit is free
Britney Spears songs?)
He's asking this in _1989_. WHERE ARE THE TURNIPS IN 2002?
Recently we saw this question echoed by Morlock Elloi -- are there
compelling reasons to ask for privacy and anonymity, besides the fact that
a bunch of (unemployed) cypherpunks are True Believers? A more pointed way
to put it would be "have the technologies we've argued about for the past
ten years *actually* changed **anyone's** lives?"
Well Tim's already partially answered this in the word "Napster!" Some 19
year old went and changed the world, created something even nontech
friends of mine not only *could* use, but *did* use. **all the time**.
Never mind that Eric Hughes had a design for something similar with his
Universal Piracy Network; this guy actually did it and the world is
fucking CHANGED because of it.
We can point to anon remailers as well; if it gets the Church of
Scientology gets hot and bothered and causes them to ruin the lives of
random people and Cypherpunk tech can stop that, well ain't that a good
thing in the end? isn't that what we're after? concrete technologies to
"make the world safe for privacy" or realize that "spectre of
crypto-anarchy" depending on your temperament?
Now we have a vision from Adam Back, the vision of a privacy
protecting independent media enhancing "storage surface" which will allow
niche REAL REPORTING to survive in a censorship resistant fashion. I think
it's a **beautiful** vision. the problem is, wasn't this what the web was
supposed to do, at least in free countries where censorship is less of an
issue? wasn't self-publishing supposed to enable a wave of voices,
bringing about the radical decentralization of self and viewpoint
prophesied in the 1960s? (a decade I know little about beyond the accounts
of _Psychoanalytic Politics_ and the aforementioned Peter Marshall book
_Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism_). Weren't we all
supposed to tune to the EZLN site with the same attention and credulity as
we gave to cnn.com? How will
be any different?
What I get from Hakim Bey in TAZ at this point is a skepticism about the
idea of computers as enabling the Temporary Autonomous Zone. In their
place, he has the usual bullshit about how it's all about "becoming" and
all about presence, spontaneity, self-defintion, and so on.
 (echoes of this essay by Benjamin about "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction," which tries to save the notion of art by
invoking a mystical "presence" of the work which is supposed to save the
"original"  work from becoming indistinguishable from its copies. today
the copies are perfect. I am listening to Britney on CD now; I listen to
Britney on mp3 over Napster tomorrow; I listen to Britney on Ogg via
Gnutella the day after and they all sound the same -- where is the
presence here especially since the "original" studio tape is kept locked
Platonic ideal style up away from where I'll ever get a chance to see it!)
So what is missing from the computer networks of today that gets in the
way of this real social change that people have been proclaiming forever?
or did the amazing change happen and I just missed it? Is there something
about our current networks that actively HINDERS the TAZ?
hell, is the temporary autonomous zone still what "cypherpunks is about"?

post? Cypherpunks is more reliable for me than it used to be, but it's not
always all there.
Thanks for the detailed summary! Even if the system may not be ready for
prime time, I think it may still be worth looking at it and following
future developments.

@_subject: Forward-secure public-key encryption eprint 
Forward-secure public-key encryption has been discussed here, on
sci.crypt, and elsewhere. To recap - the goal is that an adversary who
breaks into your computer today can't read messages sent/received
yesterday. In the interactive case, you use ephermal Diffie-Hellman. The
non-interactive case is more complicated and has had some ideas considered
by Ross Anderson, Adam Back, and David Hopwood (among others). Cypherpunks
relevance: forward security is nice for remailers.
Anyway, there's a new eprint up which shows how to construct such a scheme
starting from an ID-based encryption scheme by Boneh + Franklin.
"A Forward-Secure Public-Key Encryption Scheme"
Jonathan Katz
It's worth noting that the scheme this is based on has code available.

I should be there, since I'm free and in the area.
In a similar vein, who's going to be at DEF CON?

This seems to be related to the "Stego Watch" program sold by Wetstone
Technologies. Does anyone have more information about it? I've found
citations for a few papers on it, but none are online. I'll go to the
library later, but in the meantime has anyone read these papers or had
experience with the system in action?
How does it compare to Provos' stegdetect?

According to the TimeOutNewYork eating and drinking guide:
Blarney Rock
137 W 33rd street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue
Let's say midnight for *sure* as a meeting time, and perhaps people can
dart out there earlier if they feel like it. I plan to arrive at the con
around 2pm on Saturday and will stick my head in Blarney Rock on the way.
In case anyone wants my number, e-mail me.

I am currently in the SF Bay Area and wondering whether any cypherpunks
are around and might want to say hi. Right now I'm in Berkeley, but I'm
willing to travel (public transportation) to see people.

I agree with this as far as "crypto" protocols go. But one thing to keep
in mind is that almost all protocols impact security, whether their
dsigners realize it or not. Especially protocols for file transfer, print
spooling, or reservation of resources. most of these are designed without
people identifying them as "crypto protocols."
Another thing that makes it worse -- composition of protocols. You can do
an authentication protocol and prove you're "you." Then what? Does that
confer security properties upon following protocols, and if so what?

Don't forget schedule pressure, the overhead of bringing in a contractor
to do crypto protocol design, and the not-invented-here syndrome. I think
all of these contribute to keeping protocol design in-house, regardless of
the technical skill of the parties involved. It takes a serious investment
in time to qualify a consultant. If having the protocol right isn't a top
priority, that investment won't be made...and I'd guess that designing a
new protocol isn't common enough to merit a separate job/new hire in most
