The real problem is that this war is going to happen sooner or later,
whether we want it or not.
If we don't act now, he'll do something else in a few years which will
make Tuesday's incident look like nothing.  He is not going to someday
wake up and say "this isn't going to work, let's stop now."  He will
escalate the attacks exponentially until we give him his war, or until
the west is so decimated that it doesn't matter anymore.
The question isn't whether we go to war.  It's whether we want it now or
later.  And how many more terrorist acts we will be willing to put up
with in the meantime.

Without stating an opinon on whether or not it is right to shutdown
these sites, let me point out two things that you seem to be forgetting:
1: The courts have repeatedly held that incite to riot is not a form
   of protected speech.  A logical inference here is that incite to
   war is not protected either.
2: The US Constitution does not guarantee the rights of non-citizens
   residing in foreign nations.  Even if they buy a web page from a
   US hosting service.
