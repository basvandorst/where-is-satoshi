Tyler Durden No Yes Yes: The factory was bombed, but actual  deaths were one night watchman, "not tens of thousands", and he asserted that the  Sudanese government are the good guys in the civil war, and their opponents  terrorists. Perhaps that was true, but pretty much  everything else he reported on Nicaragua was a lie, for example that the  Sandinistas won free elections, and that the contras were a creation of the US,  and that the Sandinistas were more  popular than the contras.
