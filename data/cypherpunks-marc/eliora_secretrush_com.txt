On October 11, 1927, the Duchess of Brabant gave birth to her first child: a beautiful baby baptized with the name of Josephine-Charlotte. Almost three years later, an heir was born. He was given the name of Baudouin in memory of his deceased great-uncle who was supposed to have been king. Josephine-Charlotte of Belgium married Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg; while Baudouin married doña Fabiola de Mora y Aragón. The couple's youngest child, Albert, married donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria and inherited the Belgian throne from his brother Baudouin in 1993. The present heir to the Belgian throne, Prince Philippe, is the eldest son of Albert and Paola.
          Left without any options, Clementine and Victor passively awaited King Leopold's death so they could marry. When the King died in 1909, Clementine asked the new monarch, King Albert I, her cousin and Prince Baudouin's youngest brother, for permission to marry Victor. Albert gladly expressed his satisfaction with Clementine's plans. To Stephanie, by now remarried to Prince Lonyay, Clementine wrote, "You can imagine the depth of my happiness upon being able to correspond the love, loyalty and happiness of the man who for long years has remained next to me. God has managed to look at my plight and in his power all has been arranged."

          lSome months later, King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium invited the press to the royal palace in Brussels. "The Queen and I, declared Albert, would like to announce to you the impending marriage between Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant and the Princess Astrid of Sweden. We are convinced that the princess will bring joy and happiness to our son. Leopold and Astrid have decided to join their lives without any pressures or reasons of state. Theirs is a true union among people with the same inclinations." Queen Elisabeth, incorrigible romantic that she was, insisted in saying "It is a marriage of love...tell it to our people. Nothing was arranged. Not a single political consideration prevailed in our son's decision." Leopold and Astrid were married in Brussels on November 10, 1926

Copyright 1999
If you want to do it properly, introducing a new dog into a home that already has another dog is not a simple task. I get emails every day and it seems that 2 or 3 a day have questions about this subject. Dogs are pack animals and the average pet owner does not have a clue about the genetic instincts that are floating under the fur of their lovable pet. Yesterday, I had a lady write me who has a serious problem. She owns 30 dogs (she takes in strays) and keeps the majority of them as house dogs. She realizes that she has an obsessive compulsive problem and needs to do something about it. This women has created a "dog pack" and has seen some awesome dog fights. She has gone so far as to grind the eye teeth flat on the dogs so when they attack one another they don't do as much damage. Pretty gruesome for someone who claims to love dogs.
She confirmed some of the facts that I learned years ago:
Dogs are territorial (like wolves) They have a pack order (ranks order) which included a pack leader and every dog in the pack knows it's rank The worst dog fights are amount bitches (they are fierce) When fights begin dogs will gang up on the weaker or newer dog Some dogs (lower rank dogs) will turn and run at the mere sound of a fight Once attacked a dog will always be leery of meeting new dogs. Some will automatically be fighters the rest of their lives. So the goal of introducing a new dog into a family which already has other dogs comes down to "bringing another member into the family pack" without allowing dog fights. If done properly this can usually (not always) be done.
The wrong way to do it is to bring a new dog into the home and allow the dogs to works it out themselves. That's like asking for Monday night wrestling in your front room. The right way to do this is with the aide of a dog crate. I will put the new dog in a dog crate in the house where the other dogs can go up and look at and smell it. If there is growling I will correct the older house dogs for showing any sign of aggression. If need be, I will put prong collars on them and let them drag a leash. If they growl I will give take the leash and give a hard correction. Remember, you are the pack leader in this family. Your house dogs already know and understand this (assuming that you are a responsible dog owner). The pack leaders is the one who determines if and when a dog will fight. So if your position in the pack is firm (as a result of solid obedience training) a correction for growling will tell the house dog that "YOU WILL NOT ALLOW AGGRESSION TOWARDS THIS NEW DOG."
There is no reason to rush an introduction of a dog into your home. Let the dogs only contact be when one or the other are in a dog crate for several weeks. After enough time passes they will begin to learn that this is not really a stranger, but a member of the family pack. So when you want the new dog to be out in the house, the older dogs are either in a different room in the house or in the dog crate. Over time it will become obvious when things settle down. But remember not to rush it.
