He was just trolling, being intentionally vague so that they'd assume
he was copying from one DVD to another. Which they did, and which they raved about.
There isn't any profound insight to be derived from a tired old picture
of a newsgroup being provoked by trolling.

I usually convert a Google Groups URL to a query using only the Tim May referred to, that'd be
Then the URL won't be _too_ long, and if Google changes the URL scheme or is replaced by some other archve, you've got the original Message-ID, the best identifier you could hope for.

So what you're saying is that we need a remote-plonk mechanism to insert

All or nearly all of them are duplicates of same documents
elsewhere in the directory tree; "X/text/" and "X/iraq/" are
supposed to be copies of "X/", with images removed in the first case. I suspect that downloading them all would just confirm that.

If all we wanted was to control its oil we wouldn't try to put a democratic government in place, with or without the quote.
Gosh, the oil-conspiracy nutcases are so dumb, it's tiring.
Exactly, a bunch of lies from the usual quarters. A stream of revisionist history from useful idiots hell-bent on making it ALL OUR FAULT, ever and ever again.
It's a movable feast.

Right. We don't know that he's a murdering son of a bitch, that's all propaganda, but we DO know that we've supported him in the past and IT'S ALL OUR FAULT. That is no propaganda, surely. There's never any need to qualify *those* kinds of assertons with the "propaganda mills" line.

Of course it matters.
This is a principle of civilian life, not military conflicts. There's no "innocent until proven guilty" in military conflicts, surely you understand that.
Oh, and BTW, do you know that in the enlightened western society (give up the sarcastic quotes shtick, it's died and its corpse stinks pretty badly) judges commonly allow or deny bail, or set its amount, based on
hypothesised accusations against a detained person, when nothing at all has been proven, in the court of law or otherwise? Why don't you go and fight that grievious injustice?

I thought it was trivial all along.
Oh please. They (well, many of them) sure didn't forget their dislike of the US when they saw those newsreels of the twin towers tumbling down. Actually, they mostly systematically manipulated and fucked themselves over, with occassional help from different factions in the rest of the world. And they already have a "symbol of how we've", etc. - American military presence in the most holy of Islamic countries, Saudi Arabia. That's one of the largest reasons for Al-Qaeda growth in recent years. Compared to infidel military bases somewhere near Mecca and Medina, whatever's done to some dictator who has presided over a mostly secular regime is insignificant. And American military presence in Saudi Arabia is actually subsiding now because Iraq is no longer a threat. This is just so much armchair psychology. Most of it is silly theoretising that has no grounding in reality.
One side says: look, we had to humuliate him publicly, because those Arabs only understand power, they only respect you if you clearly show them who's the boss, bla bla bla.
The other side says: we shouldn't humiliate him, because the Arab culture is built around the all-powerful concept of pride, and they'll never forget how we hurt their pride, bla bla bla.
Both sides are spewing idiotic garbage with some marginal relevance to reality, which is much, much more complicated than that. You can't predict what "the crowd" will say, and the Arab "crowd" is no more symplistic than the American one. It does "work" somewhat differently, and does display different "mentality", whatever that means, but none of it is exploitable with any useful degree of certainty by cheap armchair This is inane.
Truth is always relevant.

But Saddam's regime itself stemmed from illegal takeover of a previous regime -- doesn't that make all of his regime illegitimate and his authority void?
The only reason Saddam has a plausible claim to authority is because he has taken gotten it by force. By the same reasoning, US or US-installed regime, which is being put into power by the use of force, has a plausible claim to authority as well.
Why not?
