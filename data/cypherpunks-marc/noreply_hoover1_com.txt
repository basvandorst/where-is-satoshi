X-Mas Ideas
Here is a flying machine like no other. The Sky Pioneer R/C Helicopter is the best chopper we've ever seen. Even the most inexperienced pilot should be able to get this chopper off the ground. This radio control helicopter has been engineered to make flying easy for kids and adults of all ages.
The key is a new flight system called "proportional control" which uses a trigger unit to regulate altitude and speed. And the lightweight but durable construction means that even bad pilots won't damage the helicopter if it nosedives into the ground.
Once airborne the helicopter will fly to heights of up to 50-70 feet, and distances of 300 feet or more. The harder you squeeze the trigger, the higher it flies. Ease off the trigger and the Sky Patrol will lose altitude and start to turn. To make the helicopter hover in place, lightly squeeze the trigger. Although recommended for outdoor flight only, we couldn't help testing it out indoors as well. For a real treat, try hovering the Sky Pioneer over a co-workers carefully stacked paperwork. Or, perhaps you better just fly it outside.
