In order for there to be a civil claim of negligence there must be, inter alia, a breach of duty.
What duty has been breached in your scenario?  None.
Actually some of us have been teaching and writing about this stuff since the mid 1990s.  These issues are far from new; we went through them in the early anonymous remailer days.

Comments deep below.
OK, you might have *contract* liability to the ISP, but not to third parities in the main.  Contract damages < tort damages < criminal penalties, the latter being what we were talking about).
The only attempt I know of to make violation of those contract terms the predicate for criminal liability failed.  Google "Lori Drew".
Normally that would just be a capacity or useage based billing issue in practice.  But sure, contract terms vary widely.  Note, though, the distinction between "having contracted to pay extra in some circumstances" (one type of 'civil liability') and risking being found in violation of the contract (another type, but usually one that results in termination of the service rather than an obligation to pay).

I believe this is incorrect under US law.  Do you have any support, statutory or case law, for this claim?
The key word above is "unlicensed".  And the other key word -- not present
