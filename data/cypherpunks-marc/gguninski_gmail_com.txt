From the history of Microsoft (part 1)

The software giant's Korean-language version of Visual Studio .Net
carries the virulent Nimda computer virus to Asia.
* [Ballmer: 'Linux is a cancer' Sat 2 Jun
Contaminates all other software with Hippie GPL rubbish.
Microsoft CEO and incontinent over-stater of facts Steve Ballmer
 said that "Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual
property sense to everything it touches," during a commercial spot
masquerading as a interview with the Chicago Sun-Times on June 1, 2001.
* [Halloween documents: August 1998 - March
The Halloween documents comprise a series of confidential Microsoft
memoranda on potential strategies relating to free software,
open-source software, and to Linux in particular, and a series
of media responses to these memoranda. Both the leaked documents
and the responses were published by Eric S. Raymond in 1998.
* [Bill Gates is an android user: 26 Sep
**%**RIP Windows Phone, we are not crying much.
* [Weird garbled Windows 7 update baffles world =E2=80=93 now Microsoft
reveals the truth: 30 Sep
Its description mostly contained garbled text. Links for more information,
help, and support were filled in with gibberish URLs with ".gov," ".mil,"
and ".edu" domains.
* [m$ is linux vendor: 27 Jun
2001: Linux is cancer, says Microsoft.

Possibly to fit Microsoft better in the so called open source community,
unknown forces [leaked m$'
