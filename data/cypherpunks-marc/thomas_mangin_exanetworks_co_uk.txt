After some offline discussion with Pedro Marques, I now realise that I misunderstood the flow rule validation process, which mean that my "complain" is really irrelevant, which is good news as it mean that inter ISP flow route exchange really have no technical obstacle that I can now think off.

Fair point. I never had to face any intelligent type of DDOS ... lucky me :)

Great to hear :)
But my point is still valid, Flowspec is great if you are are a backbone and are performing the filtering, or if you want to filter outgoing traffic. If you are a smaller network, you need the filtering to be performed by your transit provider, as your uplink will otherwise be congested. So I will stand by my comment that flowspec would see a bigger uptake if T1 could accept the flowspec routes, which they will only do once they can filter them (to insure correctness and resource protection).
PS : Someone need to add IPv6 support to the RFC :p

A less common action is to use flowspec (if you have some Juniper gear) to drop only the attack and hopefully not any legitimate traffic.
What is really missing atm is a way to filter flowspec announcements (limit the number and make sure they are for routes the peer is announcing). Until this is sorted I believe flowspec will be a marginal solution.

Running BGP over a different circuit will cause some blackholing of the traffic if the real link is down but not the BGP path.
So IIMHO the best way is still a good router with some basic QOS to protect BGP on the link.
