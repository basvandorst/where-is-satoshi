There were 116 wireless companies that received funding in the second quarter of 2001. That's $898 million dollars, 10.9% of all investments made in the quarter. Of that total, $82 million was invested in seed stage across a field of 60 companies.

The smart companies are still         money. While it is generally noted that VCs have turned         on wireless, it is interesting to note that while overall         are down from a year ago today, wireless captured essentially the         share of dollars (10.9% vs. 11.5%). However, the total dollar volume         reduced substantially ($898 Million vs. $2.8 Billion) as well as the         of companies financed (116 vs. 208).
But money  is moving. Who's getting it and how?
The companies, their descriptions, the amount they received, and who funded are all included in the report
