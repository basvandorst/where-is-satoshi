What would break is the /dev/random maintainers' brains.
This exact same discussion comes up every 5-10 years. At some point, one
or more people who actually know something about cryptography give a
critique of the unanalyzable continuously moving target that is Linux
For example:
And every time, the Linux /dev/random maintainer(s) demonstrate why
he/they should never be allowed anywhere near cryptographic code.
Good luck fixing this.

Yes, that is one idea on the right track. Another is to have the device
only accept firmware updates with an appropriate cryptographic
The iPhone uses both of these approaches.
    Plug your device into your computer with a USB cable.
    Turn off the device.
    Hold the Power button for 3 seconds.
    Hold the Home and Power buttons for 10 seconds.
    Release the Power button but keep holding the Home button.
    After about 15 seconds you will be alerted by iTunes saying that it
    has detected a device in Recovery Mode.
Granted, firmware signature schemes do have this funny tendency to get
Still, unless it was designed by idiots, any firmware update procedure
obviously must require the user to diddle with the physical controls in
some way. Regrettably few devices meet the precondition.
I dunno... How many iPhones are there?
I own one of these:
"Software updates are available"
Does my USB printer count as a "USB device"?
I am fairly certain updatable USB devices are the norm, not the
