Jim may have a sort-of-point in that on any finite machine, you will
(in principle) eventually run out of space to represent which digit
of pi you want to calculate next. But if you are stopped long before
then by either a Big Crunch or the heat death of an expanding universe
it's questionable whether that counts as "repeating".
Certainly it's irrelevent to the "cost-utility of PRNG's versus RNG's."

Or just mix pi with a more conventional PRNG, which will avoid you having
to use huge seeds to stop your output stream matching anyone's pregenerated
lookup tables of lots of digits of pi.

I've bought cars for more than that with cash. (Not $25,000 ones though).
But that starts to need to be planned, rather than just withdrawn from
an ATM in one go.
