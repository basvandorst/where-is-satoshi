i hate some doubts about this article ... it seems kind of paranoid.
all to do with the hamming distance? hmm. 'humanity has failed'? come on.

ok, but that doesn't change the fact that this article is about some
guy trying to create a controversial topic to create publicity for
it's funny he tries to suggest that something accepts random inputs
isn't an algorithm. umm what? where did he come up with that? the
world excepts 'random' inputs [us] and functions according to laws

i'm sure everyone one this list knows about customizegoogle, which you
can use to always go in the ssl gmail,
(the default install requires tweaking to get rid of ad's, etc).
i have doubts about it's anonymized cookie implementation, as i do
notice i remain logged in when i browse all my google services.
for me, i think google's very goal [organising information] goes
against any appropriate privacy implementation [or at least, that's
how they act].
they need to build privacy into their overall mission-statement.

Neither are relevant either. Solutions are obvious. The point is that
checks are unsafe, and the public - and banks - need examples like
this to consider acting.

I guess this is the obvious question/comment but I'll make it anyway:
Why would they do this? It makes not much sense, hiding illegal things
in equally illegal things.
It's like hiding marijuana inside cocaine ...
I mean I could see the point if one medium was slightly less legal
(like, say, pirated mp3's) but KP has got to be on par with terrorism

I agree, but I think it's highlighting an underlying issue that we've
been letting the wrong sort of people on the internet for a long time.
I tend to think that if this type of people ends up sticking to the
world of twitter and facebook and co, then we can safely caution them
off and just ignore them at large, so for that purpose it works well

It's interesting to think about the possibilities some sort of
homomorphic cryptosystem would offer here. I.e. it would be arguably
useful (from one point of view) if they were able to search the data
for specific items, and failing finding items of those types, *then*
the fallback is this sentence, otherwise it seems like a pretty
trivial way out for anyone wishing to hide bad activity.

Subscribing, though, only takes place on the readers side. That is,
it's just as if you were visiting it anyway. So, just don't subscribe,
and view it every so often. What you need, though, is some strategy
that means if the attacker visits the same rss feed, then they don't
get the same information. Or, the information they get is not useful
to them. So, you need some sort of encoding yahoo pipe as well. But
that's probably possible.

I think this is trivially possible with, well, just the twitter rss
feeds. But, with yahoo pipes you make *them* follow the rss feeds, and
you watch the output of that. In that way, you aren't directly linked
to them, yahoo is, and they'd need to follow the pipe and see who owns
it/visits it. But if you make it public, it's visitable by anyone. And
I don't think yahoo requires any personal info.
Of course, the idea with the pipes is that you could forward the data
around a bit, munge it, mix it in with some other services, perhaps
encrypt or what-not. But I've not gone to town on what is available
with them.
Are you thinking specifically about the request for info on Wikileaks
followers? If you just follow the public RSS of that twitter account
(assuming it is public) surely they don't have any info on you,
because you haven't had to join twitter to do that. I must admit, I
don't have much of an idea of how twitter handles that stuff, as I
haven't used it for a few years.
