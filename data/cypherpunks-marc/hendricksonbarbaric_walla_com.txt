@_subject: Macrovision annual report counting 
sobering bites groaned upland feelers
Mr. Charles Hendrickson, Macrovision Reseach Group, CEO:
"...I'm sure that software prices stopped falling.
Within just two weeks all world software producing brands
will raise them...
..I think that two weeks are the last chance to get Microsoft,
Adobe, Symantec top products for summer prices...
..yes, I think that Windows XP Service Pack 2 will
cost $180 again, not $80 as now..."
Macrovision Reseach report:
Prices of future of software market revolution?
mustache fixer unimpeded butchered rumor
clubbing greenness seizures bellicose shaming
Dobbin depositing tubing grayness clatter
awakens promise Verna pastry Schubert
