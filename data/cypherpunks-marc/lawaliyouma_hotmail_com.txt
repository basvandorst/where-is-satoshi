Dear, I am marve. from The Cote D'ivoire Abidjan ). I am the only son, being that I lost my parents a couple of days ago. My late father was a serving director of the cocoa board of directors in Cote-d'ivore Abidjan until his death . He was assassinated last 3 days by the rebels following the renewed political uprising. See attached website for details. Before his death he deposited in a high security company in Dakar Senegal the sum of ( 10.5 Million Us Dollars )being money he acquired from cocoa exports. I want you to do me a favour to receive this money in your country or any safer place. As the beneficiary I have plans to futher my education and do investment in your country, like real estate and industrial production. This is my reason for writing to you. Please if you are willing to assist me , indicate your interest in replying soonest. I am now in Dakar Senegal. I left my country following the wake of departures of foreign nationals residing in Abidjan. Thanks and best regards. marve .
