@_subject: Get Your Resume Posted Instantly 
Hello, I'm a National Recruiter and Placement Specialist. I would like to share with you a resume distribution site that we use.
This is the best distribution site that we have seen. They actually send your resume out to recruiters and companies to get you the right position. We know that they do what they say they are going to do, because we are in a network of recruiters and they all receive resumes from them. And, we have found positions for people that they have sent to us. I am not telling you to sign up I am only suggesting a very good tool to use in the employment process. Exposure is the name of the game in today's market. If you would like to check the site out go to Good luck in your search. Sandy Fife (HR) (Personal Touch Jobfinder)
