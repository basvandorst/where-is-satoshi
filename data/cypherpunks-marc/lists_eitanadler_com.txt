Nothing stops application layer protocols from sharing one mechanism
Why does language matter ever matter in the network layer?
Exactly. You can't infer language from location. Some locations have
multiple valid languages.  This isn't a valid use case.
Why do layer 3 devices need this information?  So far you have
mentioned exactly one use case that *might* be useful.
I didn't say that. I said that this is the first time I you have
mentioned anything that *could* (not necc. should) be acting at layer
Unless the ISP decides to ignore your "request" and provide the
information anyways. Also, what if your actual location differs from
the IP address range your request is coming from. This can easily
occur from tunnels or mobile networks.
How does the IP layer know when the *application layer* needs this information?
How would my ISP know my GPS coordinates?  Once again please think
about this in the context of tunnels and mobile networks.
Why should the policy differ based on GPS coordinates?

Depends on the operating system.
On Linux programs generating long term keys should read from
On FreeBSD /dev/random and /dev/urandom are identical.
