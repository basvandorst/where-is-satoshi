K LINE ACHIEVES  GREEN TARGETS JAPANS K Line has reported that it largely achieved its environmental targets in the last financial year. K Lines Environmental Report 2003 provides an analysis of the results for the Fiscal 2002 targets and introduces the new targets for Fiscal 2003, both of which are summarized below: Among the companys achievemements were the expanded use of recycled paper to almost 100% and improved the separation of waste materials for recycling, the reduction in the use of fuel oil and lubricating oil per ton-mile of cargo transported, the reduction of electricity consumption in offices, reduction in emissions of CO2, N0x and S0x, etc and the replacement of refrigerant R-12 with R-134. Against thise successes the company  but failed to reduce volume of paper for photocopying and the volume actually increased.   This years targets include: prevention of marine pollution, a total ban on the use of TBT paints, proper management of occurring wastes and exhausts and recycling (reuse) of materials, discharge ashore of all empty bottles/cans generated onboard for positive promotion of recycling, proper management/treatment of dirty water used for cleaning containers after unloading, the saing natural resources, further reduction of use of fuel oil and lubricating oil per ton-mile,  prevention of air pollution, total abolition of R-12 refrigerated containers by the end of 2003 and  an increase in use of environmentally-friendly refrigerants such as R-404a. UK MCA TO GET ACCESS TO COMMS DATA THE UKs Home Office has laid an Order before Parliament to add the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to the list of public authorities able to access Communications Data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The legislation would give access to communications data to selected officers of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for the purposes of: in an emergency preventing death or injury; in the interests of public safety; and preventing and detecting maritime crime. The MCA stresses that the type of data it would access, under very carefully controlled conditions, is limited to subscriber details for telephone and e-mail accounts, and itemised telephone bills. Additionally, and for search and rescue purposes only, the cell identification for a mobile telephone in use which will assist in locating a caller who may be in difficulties.  The MCA is not to be authorised to intercept the contents of any communications, which includes telephone conversations and e-mails. A further Order also laid in Parliament yesterday under Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, proposes to give the MCA powers to carry out directed surveillance and use covert human intelligence sources in order to enforce safety and pollution legislation on board British and other ships in UK waters. This could involve plain clothes MCA officers watching, for example, the unlicensed hiring of  a pleasure craft. It could also include the MCA asking particular crew members who have reported a possible offence to report further incidents. MCA Chief Executive Stephen Bligh said "The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is firmly committed to preventing loss of life at sea. We are delighted to be included in the new Order so that our emergency response and enforcement procedures are transparent, proportionate, and in accordance with best practice.   We would only wish to impose on the privacy of an individual where there was a clear risk to the safety of that person or others." ITF CLAIMS EURO PORTS DISRUPTION THE International Transport Workers Union claims that ports across Europe were brought to a standstill this week as part of  combined campaign merging its traditional action against open register ships with the European dovkers unions protests against the EU proposed ports directive. Union activists claim to have boarded 427 vessels in what ITF describes as an intensive union drive to challenge growing danger of deskilling on the docks and to tackle shoddy working conditions on board ship. Dockers in 18 countries staged work stoppages, demonstrations and rallies to highlight the alleged dangers of selfhandling of cargo and of the proposed EU Ports Directive aimed at liberalising port services.  ITF says that cargo-handling by seafarers was stopped on the Antigua and Barbuda-flagged Sloman Commander in the Belgian port of Antwerp, on the Maltese-registered MSC Provence in Lisbon, Portugal and on the Lodestar-Tonga in the Croatian port of Riieka.  A vessel detained in Slovenia for cargo-handling was also found to have eighteen technical faults. Cargo handling, in the dockers view, can include the long vexed issue of lashing cargo. Greece and Denmark were hit particularly badly. There was 24-hour strike in the Greek ports of Piraeus and Eleusis and Danish ports were stopped for two days. Back pay handed over seafarers during the week of action, the ITF claimed, totalled almost US$390,000.    ITF appears to be particularly pleased at its singling out of the Italian-flagged Grande Ellade, because of the stand taken by Grimadis boss Emanuele Grimaldi.  ITF says that the ship arrived in the Danish port of Esbjerg a day ahead of schedule to avoid the strike but was out-manoeuvred by dock workers who brought forward their stoppage in order to detain the ship and prevent cargo-handling by its crew. Mr Grimaldi is a strong supporter of the EU Ports Directive.  ITF Dock Workers Secretary Kees Marges says the unions are pressing for key amendments put forward by the European Parliament to remain the final text of the Directive. He says: These amendments stipulate conditions for cargo handling in terminals and oblige local port authorities to introduce minimum conditions for each port service. With those safeguards in place there is a real chance of peace in the ports, otherwise the major demonstration against the Directive planned for 29 September  in Rotterdam will start a whole new escalation of social unrest in ports throughout Europe.  MOL IN KOREA ­ HAIPHONG SLOT CHARTER MITSUI OSK is offering a Pusan-Haiphong service through a space charter agreement with Korean line Heung-A Shipping. MOL says it is making the move, in response to increasing customer demand in the Korea-Vietnam trade  and that the service will start in early October.  MOL added: This service will enable MOL to operate more competitively in the region, and reduce transit time from Pusan to Haiphong to only five days. Two 1,000-TEU class container ships will be used for this service, which will call at Pusan (Fri/Fri), Hong Kong (Mon/Tue), and Haiphong (Wed/Thu).   MARITRANS LOSES OPA LEGAL BATTLE The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) did not take single-hull tank vessels to the extent that the federal government would have to pay compensation, according to a report on the website of law firm Holland and Knight.  Maritrans  owned a number of single-hulled tank barges at the time OPA 90 came into effect and brought suit against the government, arguing that the statute effectively destroyed the future economic value of its property. It contended that, under the US Constitution, this resulting in a taking for which compensation must be paid.  Holland and Knight reports that, in a lengthy analysis, the court held that the value of the tank vessels was not decreased sufficiently to constitute a categorical taking, in part because of the extended phase-in period of the requirement for a double hull. Because OPA 90 was enacted for the public good and did not disproportionately place its burden on this company, the court held that the statute did not constitute a regulatory taking. As a result, the court determined that the company is not entitled to compensation from the government despite financial losses incurred as a result of OPA 90.

BRUSSELS PORT PLAN TORPEDOED THE European Parliament yesterday rejected a compromise on the highly controversial proposed directive on market access to port services by a narrow majority of 229 votes to 209 votes. The vote appears to effectively kill the  directive, which was first proposed by the European Commission in February 2001. The vote has attracted widely varying responses. European Sea Ports Organisation Chairman David Whitehead said: The vote against the Directive in Parliament today is very disappointing after all the successful progress that we made in improving the original proposal of the Commission. The conciliation agreement included almost everything we campaigned for. There was a mixture of motives in rejecting the Directive, he added. Some MEPs believed that the conciliation agreement did not go far enough. There was also strong union pressure on MEPs with some emotional and uninformed lobbying. The future is now very uncertain, Mr Whitehead said. We will loose momentum in dealing with State aid and financial transparency. Above all, there is a threat of action against individual ports now that the protection offered by the Directive is no longer available. By contrast International Transport Workers federation general secretary  David Cockroft described the result as a triumph. He said it was A milestone victory, not just for the trade unions and workers who campaigned so effectively against this hopelessly flawed legislation, but also for everyone in the ports and shipping industries who believes in safe ports and social dialogue. We commend all the MEPs who thought long and hard about this issue. He continued: A diktat has been rejected. No doubt there will be other attempts to introduce ports of convenience, but they too will be fought. What decided many MEPs to vote against the directive was the way that it was cooked up without any consultation with interested parties. The European Parliament has shown that everyone involved must be included when major programmes are planned. This shows that deregulation is not the easy answer to problems in transport industries.  BV WELCOMES RATIONAL REGULATORY APPROACH SPEAKING at a reception for owners and the media in London yesterday evening the managing director of Bureau Veritass marine Division, Bernard Anne praised recent developments at the International Association of Classification Societies.   Mr Anne said: Shipping is doing well, and so is Bureau Veritas. We are happy for that, but we are especially happy that this year we have seen the whole shipping industry moving towards a more rational regulatory approach. For years we have worked with other societies to develop common rules, and we have been, at times, a lone voice crying in the wilderness for class to work together, to make IACS strong, and to build a common technical platform. Today we see a new relationship coming into place, with IMO and Flag States setting goal-based standards, and class developing common technical standards to implement them. He stressed the need for co-operation with the industry, saying: Without co-operation we can do nothing. He said the French classification society was very happy to work within this new framework.  He added that there were some urgent technical issues to address. He singled out the issues of permanent means of access double hull for bulkers.  On means of access he said: This is a difficult subject, but one which BV has studied carefully. It is an area where we need the co-operation of everyone involved to get a sensible solution to what regulators reasonably want. Regarding double hulls said: We have done a lot of work on that lately and .. are contributing that work at IACS and the common rule development process for double hull bulkers.  LTS NEW CHINA-BLACK SEA SERVICE TAIWAN-based Evergreen groups Italian subsidiary Lloyd Triestino is expanding its coverage of the Adriatic, East Mediterranean and Black Sea through a vessel sharing deal with French line CMA CGM. Having launched a direct China - Adriatic (ADR) service at the end of October and an inter-Mediterranean regional service (IMS)  in mid November, the company is now to inaugurate a direct link between China and the Black Sea with the first sailings in early December. CMA CGM deploys seven ships, each of approximately 2300TEU, on this route. Ports of call are: Ningbo - Shanghai - Xiamen - Chiwan - Port Kelang - Colombo  Port Said - Piraeus - Istanbul - Constanza - Odessa - Ilichevsk - Damietta  - Port Kelang - Ningbo. For Lloyd Triestino, the first westbound sailing on this new service will be CMA CGM Marmara from Ningbo on 7 December and the first eastbound sailing CMA CGM Greece from Piraeus on 8 December.  LR SETS UP TRANSPORT RISK CHAIR UK-based classification society Lloyds Register is funding the establishment of the Lloyds Register Chair in Transport Risk Management at Imperial College, London. The Chair is located in the Centre for Transport Studies in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and will be funded by Lloyds Register, initially for five years.  The first holder of the Chair will be Professor Andrew Evans, who will move to Imperial College on January 1, 2004. Professor Evans is at present Professor of Transport Safety in the sister Centre for Transport Studies at University College London, where he has been since 1991. Andrew Evans is an economist and statistician. His safety interests have been in risk estimation, risk appraisal, the economics of safety, and safety regulation. He has worked particularly on economic and statistical analyses of train accidents, and has contributed to many of the debates on train accident risks and safety measures in the past decade. He has also worked on safety in other modes, including roads and aviation, and on inter-modal safety comparisons.  David Moorhouse, Executive Chairman of Lloyds Register, said: I am delighted to announce the establishment of this Chair at Imperial College which I believe will have a major impact on transport risk management. It is a natural extension of our own research and development work in support of the industries we serve, and very much in line with our constitutional aim to enhance the safety of life and property.   NZ PLANS SECURITY CHARGE NEW Zealands Customs Minister Rick Barker has unveiled plans to charge carriers fees to cover increased cargo security measures. He plans to impose a flat fee of between $450 and $650 for the processing of the outward cargo report that must be lodged for every departing ship or aircraft.  Mr Barker said that the country facing extra costs on its export and import trade because of much higher security standards being required by the United States.        "The cost of establishing and maintaining these trade security measures in New Zealand exceeds Customs ongoing budget and core responsibility of protecting New Zealanders," Mr Barker said.   "So the government has decided that those who benefit from New Zealands reputation as a safe and secure trading partner should contribute toward the cost of meeting these new requirements.   "It is proposed that a new security fee be introduced from July 2004 to recover approximately $8 million from the expo!
rt sector, $4 million from importers and $8 million for security screening of goods trans-shipped through New Zealand.   "The new standards would mean that trading partners could be confident that cargo sealed with a New Zealand Customs-approved seal is secure and therefore did not need to be checked on arrival at their wharves.   "If we do not comply, our vital exports could sit on foreign wharves for days awaiting Customs clearance, while competitors with security agreements get their cargo across the border without delay."   Mr Barker said he had met with the Joint Industry Consulting Group (JICG), an organisation of Customs stakeholders representing those involved in the supply chain, to discuss how the fee structure would be designed.   "I am inviting business representatives to work with Customs to ensure that the proposed new security compliance fee is collected in an efficient and effective manner, Mr Barker said.

EU IN DANGER OF LOSING PLOT OVER PRESTIGE EU Members and coastal states worldwide are in danger of losing the plot over the response to the Prestige spill, according to the International Salvage Union (ISU), by not putting resources into salvage response.  In a statement issued yesterday to mark the first anniversary of the loss of the tanker off the Spanish coast, ISU President Joop Timmermans said:  Even the World Wide Fund for Nature fails to focus sufficiently on prevention. It called on the IMO to declare more Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas, but such status is meaningless without additional salvage cover. . He went to say:  Much has been achieved since the loss of the Prestige. In particular, there is now a much clearer understanding of the importance of taking the right decision when confronted with a request for a place of refuge. New guidelines in this area are about to be adopted by the IMO. Unfortunately, however, governments appear to be at risk of losing the plot when it comes to the fundamental issue: preventing the next Prestige.  While there is always room for improvement in the management and operation of ships, no amount of fresh regulatory action will eradicate the potential for another Prestige. The obvious counter, therefore, is to reinforce salvage cover in areas of the world that are heavily trafficked and environmentally sensitive.  Mr Timmermans dwelt at some length on the consequences of Spains decision not let the stricken tanker have safe refuge, saying: The investment needed to achieve a dramatic reinforcement of salvage cover is small-scale and out of all proportion to the much larger potential benefit. In 2002, the ISU memberships income from casualty salvage totalled just US $120 million. In contrast, the cost of the Prestige clean-up and compensation settlement will run into billions.  The huge financial burden of Prestige-type events can be avoided in almost all cases according to Mr Timmermans. He added: There are various estimates of the Prestige costs. The latest estimate, produced by WWF, states that damage to tourism, fishing, other economic interests and natural heritage may involve a final cost in the order of 5 billion. It also notes that the Spanish Government has developed a 12.5 billion recovery strategy for Galicia.  In contrast, we estimate that the Salvage Award for the Prestige  had the salvor been granted a place of refuge and so had the chance to prevent the loss of the vessel  would have been in the order of 5-15 million. While some pollution of a safe haven would have been inevitable, it would have been on a much more modest scale. The cost would probably have been in the order of 20-30 million.  The cost of a successful salvage, with limited pollution damage, would have been 50 million at most. Instead, the cost may run into several billions. Governments need to wake up to the fact that the investment of a tiny fraction of such huge sums would be enough to transform the availability of salvage protection and do much to prevent billion dollar plus spill events.   K LINE PROFITS BOOST JAPANESE shipping group K Line made an operating profit of Yen34.3bn (US$308m) for the six months, ended September 30, up from Yen11.2bn in the same period last year. In a statement the company said that although it had been hit by bunker price rises and the appreciation of the Yen it had benefited from high container volumes and, following form that, freight rate restorations while the tramp shipping markets also improved. K Line expects much better results from its container shipping operations this year while it looks forward to dry bulk rates remaining firm.  WITASSS REEFER SURCHARGE CARRIERS belonging to the The Association of West India Trans-Atlantic Steam Ship Lines are applying a peak season surcharge of US$250.00 per container on reefer boxes between  January 1 and  April 30. A Witass statement says: The increasing volumes of reefer cargoes destined to Europe far exceed the westbound reefer trade. This imbalance is particularly extreme during the first four months of the year when Lines have to position, at increasing cost, an extraordinary amount of empty equipment to serve the demands of the export trade.  BRIDGE FAILURES IN PRIDE OF PROVENCE ACCIDENT POOR bridge team management and the disorientation of the master have been indentified by the UKs Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) as prime reasons why the P&O Stena ro-ro ferry Pride of Provence hit the southern breakwater at Dover Harbour in April this year.  Several passengers and crew were injured in  the incident which occurred when the master attempted to turn the ship while still passing between the ports breakwaters. The MAIB report says that P&O Ferries has taken steps to ensure improved passage planning while Dover will tighten its port control procedures. The MAIB has recommended that Dover considers providing leading lights for its two entrances.  RCL ORDERS NEW SHIPS BUT SAYS FEEDER RATES STILL LOW THAI-listed common feeder, Regional Container Lines (RCL) has ordered two new 2,378-TEU ships from MHI  but has also pointed out that feeder operators are still struggling under historically depressed rates.    According to a Singapore Shipping Times report  RCL chairman Kua Phek Long noted the success mainline operators were currently enjoying, with significant rate restorations on the long haul trades.and said: 'We hope they will appreciate that feeder operators also need a revival of the rates which are at a historical low.'  He added 'The intra-Asia rates are not as aggressively reviving as the long haul trade. This meant feeders must press all service providers, including ports and terminals, 'to join us in our ongoing search for more cost reductions'.
