5. Be sure the duck has good eyesight. Nearsighted ducks sometimes fail to
realize that they are on the gauges and go flogging off in the nearest hill.
Very nearsighted ducks will not realize that they have been thrown out and
will descend to the ground in a sitting position. This maneuver is difficult
to follow in an airplane.
6. Use land-loving ducks. It is very discouraging to break out and find
yourself on final for a rice paddy, particularly if there are duck hunters
around. Duck hunters suffer from temporary insanity while sitting in
freezing weather in the blinds and will shoot at anything that flies.
