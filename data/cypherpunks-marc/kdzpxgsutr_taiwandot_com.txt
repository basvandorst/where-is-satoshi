Hey Torres,
I haven't heard from you in awhile and just wanted to catch up.
What are you doing now? How's work going? I've been really busy
lately, haven't really had much time to do anything My job has
me working like 80 hrs a week, flying back and forth from London to New York.
Well I gotta run, just hit me up when you get a chance.
See ya,
Yvette Torres
