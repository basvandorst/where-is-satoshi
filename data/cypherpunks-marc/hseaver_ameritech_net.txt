Hash: SHA1
On Sunday, 16. September 2001 00:31, you (Hauke
I'd like to make a similar offer to any developer and/or
author of cryptographic and/or steganographic software or other
related material (HOWTOs , books etc.). We are setting up a mirror at
University of Tuebingen in Germany, which is eventually going to have a reasonable
amount of HDD space (~10 GB, perhaps more) and HTTP access (eventually CVS
for developers) for that purpose. Anybody who's interested should simply
drop me a line (best would be PGP-encrypted, see header).

projects interested in getting mirrored or people interested in
offering additional mirror capacity, just send me a mail.
please consider using PGP.

I'll try again, not as an attachment.
-------- Original Message --------
...hope this is not too off-topic...
...this maybe just coincidence and/or caused by other
reasons (maybe some
well read web referee?)... but it seems that after the
US-event of
09/11/2001 the accesses went up for 2 prominent
cryptographic linux
packages; are we getting more paranoid?
..any ideas?

Of course, I just meant being singled out for "special treatment" any
more than the rest of you. Obviously we are being monitored/sniffed/etc.
And probably this will increase. At any rate, the question still stands: Is
any legal action being proposed against this? I'd certainly like to be part
of any  class action suit, although I have little monetary resources to

So right -- all these people talking about "it had to be a big, well
funded, well organized group with lots of resources" are talking total nonsense.
It could have been a tiny cadre of eight or twelve people with no more money
than to buy some plane tickets. Flying a plane doesn't take a heck of lot
either, once it's in the air. It's not even that hard taking off -- landing is
the bitch.
        What would be so hard about getting past security if they used plastic
knives -- those zytel daggers sold all over the place would be pretty damn
effective. I would imagine that they wouldn't have just threatened with them
anyway, they would have just used them and killed the crew quickly. A plastic
knife would be all they needed, and no metal detector would spot that.

@_subject: Carnivore Early Deployment 
In light of the apparent widespread deployment of
carnivore at many, if not most, US ISP's, without, I
presume, any sort of warrants, does anyone know of any
proposals for lawsuits against same by EFF, ACLU, or anyone
else? This would certainly be an abrogation of civil rights
for all of us whose email is being intercepted without even
the remotest probable cause. I would think it ripe for a
class action suit.
        I'm assuming that ameritech knuckled under, although
I've not seen any announcements of it, but last night when
trying to pop mail from their server, I was getting no
connection for quite awhile, then suddenly I got a message
saying the "account is locked by another session or for
maintenance" -- something I've never, ever seen before,
although ameritech certainly has had a lot of problems with
it's mail servers. Then again this morning, for over an
hour, the incoming stuff just stopped. We sent several test
messages from various servers, none of them arrived until
much, much later.
       Not that I'm paranoid, I seriously doubt they'd be
monitoring my mail in particular, but I would also assume
that any installation of something like carnivore would
cause problems with the mail at an already rather fragile
entity like ameritech.

Actually, they do. At least in ant terms they do.  Some ants build
extremely high (relative to their size) towers, others build in trees,
bushes, etc. And they communicate, very well in fact, and use boats, fight
wars, farm, herd, have slaves - in short pretty much everything humans do,
albeit a bit differently. We can only conjecture about whether they have
religion, literature (could be at least oral tradition literature), music,
and the like, but I certainly wouldn't doubt it.
        Although when ants build hi-rises, it's for a good, sound,
environmental reason.
