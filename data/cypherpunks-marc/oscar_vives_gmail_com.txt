Fast and not centralized seems good traits.  Urls are ugly, but thats
manageable, are not human readable, but humans can copy it around.
I get this:
2012-01-24 10:01:22 ERROR 504: Gateway Time-out.
Googling for VVJJOkNISzp3NWo1aWd2M3NmYnlsM21pczZ5enRjN2thbTpmMjdjenBtNW13Zm=
finds only this site. (I somehow expected to find other servers
hosting a gateway to the same file).

tions like this; possibly the most complete attempt (in terms of attempted =
privacy and distribution) is Freenet:
and Tor, but - wonderful as they are - they're slow.
 of 700Mb+ AVIs? :-)
These services are not needed yet.  But is good that are under study,
in case changes in laws or balance of power make it needed.
For now, I think people will continue using HTTP download/stream
movies and tv series.
Perhaps countries where the 3 strikes legislation is aprobed will make
one of these systems necesary. But I think speed is a important
factor, and no slow system will suceed.

What sould fileshares must do, is to store files in these services in
a encrypted way, and anonimized name. So these services have
absolutelly no way to tell what are hosting.
Fileshares can organize thenselves in sites based on a forum software
that is private by default (open with registration), then share some
"information" file that include the url to the files hosted, and the
key to unencrypt these files, and some metadata. A special desktop
program* would load that information file, and start the http
This way can combine the best of the old "BBS" systems to the best of
the current caching and hosting technologies.  These http hosting
services seems to operate well enough. A % of the users go premium to
allow more and better downloads.
*Maybe is time to write such program.

If anyone have a really good idea how to fix this mess, It will be a
good idea to contact with Jeff Atwood (of  codehorror.com and
stackoverflow.com fame).  He and other people is working on a new
internet approach to discussions.  Think forums 2.0.  If this new pet
rock succeed, could change how the world use, eerrh... forums.  We
could hit two problems with the same rock.

Anonymity on the Internet is a feature, because a lot of the world
netcitizens come from countries where saying this or that is a crime,
and can get you in trouble.
Any asymetric cryptography solution that remove anonymity is a bad
thing. Making censorship easier on the internet is making it worse.
What could do some good, is to discredit some bad practices, and
propose alternate better practices.
This is hard, and part of it is because some people good practices is
other people good practices.   We can't start this yet, because we
don't agree on these good practices.
Theres something weird with passwords length,  on most websites you
are allowed to type a 80 or 120 characters long name.  But if you try
that with your password, you find a problem.  Somehow VARCHAR(120) is
unfeasible for passwords, but ok for first_name,second_name.
Is even more weird wen people are storing hashs.  The length of a md5
don't change if I choose very long passwords, so why are people
limiting password length?
Other weird limitations that "must go", is the idea that you can't use
"special characters". The expresion "special characters" is a red flag
itself.  Most passwords sould allow UTF-8, and allow anything that
UTF-8 allow.
Forcing people to mix uppercase and lowercase.. I understand where
this come from. It enhance the password strength. A what price? Making
passwords a random mix of letter and numbers make then hard to
remember and make life miserable for everyone. Practices to make
passwords stronger may be pushing people to write password down, or
reuse passwords.

The problem:
- Modern internet users must have lots of different login/passwords around
the internet.  Most of then in easy-to-break poorly-patched poorly-managed
servers,  like linkedin.
The solution:
-  Reduce the number of authentication.  Allow anonymous posting in more
Imagine this.   I post something on the blog  "yadaydayda". I give my email
and nothing else.   The blog software sends me a email to confirm the post.
I click on it, and the post is published.
The real problem is that nowdays everybody and his dog want a password, and
a password is expensive for the user.  The internet need more anonymous
ways to publish content.

Its like you have to abandon USA based encryptation systems that are
closed source. But I dunno, maybe open source solutions can have
