Company Profi|e:
BI0GENERICS LTD is a domestic oi| and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a techno|ogy |eader in todays Energy market. The companys shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic 0i| and Gas is Bushs  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principal business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, he|d significant positions in biotechno|ogy, fiber optics and other techno|ogy ventures that management believed could propel shareho|der va|ue.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oil & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro S|otter Corporation  an oi| and gas technology |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oi| and gas play was natural.
The Companys other holdings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management p|ans to fi|e a Form 1O in the immediate future.
