As I mentioned, these things are defined in 15 CFR Part 774.  From my
understanding, the gist of it is: if the software attempts to hide data to
keep it private, then it is classified as encryption software, subject to
some exceptions for certain uses and short key lengths, etc..  If it only
contains data assurance algorithms, like checksums, hashes, signatures,
etc, without hiding any of the data contents, and it is not modifiable by
the user, and probably a lot more and's, then it is not encryption
software.  If the code you just posted is applying a one-time-pad or
something similar, then I believe it would be classified as encryption
software.  I believe it might be possible to submit a "classification
request" if there is any uncertainty.  Note however that if your goal is
simply to mess with someone, they might well respond in kind.

See 15 CFR Part 774 which contains The Commerce Control List

case - but they're taking the cautious approach of also including the
lower-level defenses.
In fact, just the opposite.  Clearly Apple does NOT think it has a strong
constitutional case.  The reason I say that is because Apple has said, both
in its brief and in public statements, that there needs to be a public
debate and then Congressional action to determine how far companies should
be required to go to assist law enforcement.  If Apple believed they had a
strong constitutional case, then they would be saying Congress has no
authority under the Constitution to force us to help law enforcement, and
therefore no debate case closed end of story.  But they essentially have
already conceded Congress does have this authority by inviting the debate
and Congressional action.

In all these examples, you are asking if the court can order you to sign
something that is published.  In this case, Apple is being asked to "sign"
code that will not be published and is not speech.  That is a huge
distinction.  Second, the court can order you to provide your signature if
they need a signature sample to validate a document.  Your signature in
that case is not considered an endorsement under the law, nor would it be
in this case.  Third, the "signature" that Apple would have to apply acts
like a lock that opens a safe.  In other words, the "signature" is a
technological control.  So the question is, can the court order you to
unlock a safe?  The answer is yes.  If we renamed "sign" to "unlock", would
that make you feel better about it?  Because that in reality is what is
happening.  Apple is being ask to unlock the device so the code will run on
it.  It should be noted that the computer industry created this new use for
the existing words "sign" and "signature".  Just because we call it "sign"
and "signature" does not make it the same a a legal signature. i.e., a
personal endorsement or form of speech, nor should the courts recognize
them as such in every case.  Whether it is a legal signature, an
endorsement or speech depends on the specific context and facts of the
case.  In this case, Apple is not in fact being asked to provide a legal
signature, they are just being asked to unlock the device.  I'm in favor of
Apple's position, but the free speech arguments don't hold up to scrutiny.
Let's not turn this into something it isn't.

I'm not sold on the "code is speech" argument.  Building a utilitarian,
non-expressive machine is not speech.  Building a utilitarian,
non-expressive machine that contains code does not turn either the machine
nor the code into speech.  Certainly code can be a form of speech,
depending on its content and intent, but not all code is speech.  In this
case however, I don't think the non-expressive portions of Apple's OS nor
its firmware are speech, nor would unpublished code (such as Apple is being
asked to provide) constitute speech, nor would signing unpublished code
constitute speech.

Another alternative would be to re-architect the services of interest to
use a message or packet store-and-forward protocol with a random delay to
thwart traffic analysis.
