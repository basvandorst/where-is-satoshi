the security you get from an .onion address isn't all that great, you
know. new hidden service names will be a lot longer. also having some
certification that it is actually run by them is useful (but ... but
... ca trust! i don't give a fuck right now)
there are enough reasons for people to use this - while people
apparently have their accounts locked when they try to log in through
this, i assume that is a kink they will deal with better in the
future. in a hostile network, i'd trust a tls secured hidden service
more than anything else i have at my disposal
also, facebook may be crap but it is just another platform to be used
to communicate with people - you may not want what you post associated
with your network location or your person - a lot of people also use
twitter "anonymously" in the same way, why discriminate platforms it
is all the same shit (i said to a fellow gmail user)
not everything is about hiding - if you wanted that, say goodbye to
modern society

- there was an open hardware version of this
somewhere, but maybe all that went away when they got a new name and a
hipster website ... not for the purpose you are discussing but still

looks like there's collateral damage, torservers had some exits seized
- wonder how many more exits are affected that do not have an
organization attached to them
