@_subject: Good News 
God speaks with me
1)Sept 2003: I was down Pittsburgh, and I heard a voice that said,"Good
News". It confused me, but I felt compeled to come home to my old church.
2)When I arrive home I recieve a Good News Bible in the church from my dad.
3)I have never heard of this Bible before in my life, the "Good News" I was
spoken to is manifested in physical form.
Get a Good News Bible yourself. The Sermon on the Mount 5 Jesus saw the crowds and went up a hill, where he sat down. His disciples
gathered around him, 2 and he began to teach them:
True Happiness
(Luke 6.20-23)
3"Happy are those who know they are spiritually poor; the Kingdom of heaven
belongs to them!
4"Happy are those who mourn; God will comfort them!
5"Happy are those who are humble; they will recieve what God has promised!
6"Happy are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires; God
will satisfy them fully!
7 "Happy are those who are merciful to others; God will be merciful to
8"Happy are the pure in heart; they will see God!
9"Happy are those who work for peace; God will call them his children!
10"Happy are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires;
the Kingdom of heaven belongs to them!
11"Happy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all
kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. 12 Be happy and
glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven. This is how the prophets who
lived before you were perscuted.
Salt and Light (Mark 9.50; Luke 14.34-35)
13"You are like salt for all mankind. But if salt loses its saltiness,
there is no way to make it salty again. It has become worthless, so it is thrown
out and people trample on it.
14 "You are like light for the whole world. A city built on a hill cannot
be hid. 15 No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead he puts it
on the lampstand, where it gives light for everyone in the house. 16 In the
same way your light must shine before people, so that they will see the good
things you do and praise your Father in heaven.
Teaching about the Law
17"Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law of Moses and the
teachings of the prophets. I have not come to do away with them, but to make
their teachings come true. 18 Remember that as long as heaven and earth last,
not the least point nor the smallest detail of the Law will be done away
with-not until the end of all things. a 19 So then, whoever disobeys even the
least important of the commandments and teaches others to do the same, will be
least in the Kingdom of heaven. On the other hand, whoever obeys the Law and
teaches others to do the same, will be great in the Kingdom of heaven. 20 I
tell you, then, that you will be able to enter the Kingdom of heaven only if
you are more faithful than the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees in doing
what God requires.
Teaching about Anger 21 "You have heard that people were told in the past,'Do not commit murder;
anyone who does will be brought to trual.' 22 But now I tell you: whoever is
angry with his brother will be brought to trial, whoever calls his brother
'You good-for-nothing!' will be brought before the Council, and whoever calls
his brother a worthless fool will be in danger of going to the fire of
hell.23 So if you are about to offer your gift to God at the altar and there you
remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there
in front of the altar, go at once and make peace with your brother, and then
come back and offer your gift to God.
25"If someone brings a lawsuit against you and takes you to court, settle
the dispute with him while there is time, before you get to court. Once you
are there, he will turn you over to the judge, who will hand you over to the
police, and you will be put in jail. 26 There you will stay, I tell you, until
you pay the last penny of your time.
Teaching about Adultery
27"You have heard that it was said,'Do not commit adultery.'28 But now I
tell you: anyone who looks at a woman and wants to possess her is guilty of
committing adultery with her in his heart. 29 So if your right eye causes you to
sin, take it out and throw it away! It is much better for you to lose a part
of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell. 30 If your right
hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is much better for
you to lose one of your limbs than to have your whole body go off to hell.
Teaching about Divorce
(Matthew 19.9; Mark 10.11-12; Luke 16.18)
31"It was also said,'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a written
notice of divorce.' 32 But now I tell you: if a man divorces his wife for any
cause other than her unfaithfulness, then he is guilty of making her commit
adultery if she marries again; and the man who marries her commits adultery
Teaching about Vows
33"You have also heard that people were told in the past,'Do not break your
promise, but do what you have vowed to the Lord to do.' 34 But now I tell
you: do not use any vow when you make a promise. Do not swear by heaven, for it
is God's throne; 35 nor by earth, for it is the resting place for his feet;
nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Do not even swear
by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37 Just
say 'Yes' or 'No'-anything else you say comes from the Evil One.
Teaching about Revenge
(Luke 6.29-30)
38 "You have heard that it was said,'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth.'39 But now I tell you: do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you.
If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, let him slap your left cheek too. 40
And if someone takes you to court to sue you for your shirt, let him have your
coat as well. 41 And if one of the occupation troops forces you to carry his
pack one mile, carry it two miles. 42 When someone asks you for something,
give it to him; when someone wants to borrow something, lend it to him.
Love for Enemies
(Luke 6.27-28,32-36)
43"You have heard that it was said,'Love your friends, hate your enemies.'
44 But now I tell you: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
you, 45 so that you may become the sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes
his sun to shine on bad and good people alike, and gives rain to those who do
good and to those who do evil. 46 Why should God reward you if you love only
the people who love you? Even the taxcollectors do that! 47 And if you speak
only to your friends, have you done anything out of the ordinary? Even the
pagans do that! 48 You must be perfect-just as your Father in heaven is
Teaching about Charity
6 "Make certain you do not perform your religious duties in public so that
people will see what you do. If you do these things publicaly, you will not
have any reward from your Father in heaven.
2"So when you give something to a needy person, do not make a big show of
it, as the hypocrites do in the houses of worpship and on the streets. The do
it so that people will praise them. I assure you, they have already been paid
in full. 3 But when you help a needy person, do it in such a way that even
your closest friend will not know about it. 4 Then it will be a private
matter. And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you.
Teaching about Prayer (Luke 11.2-4)
5"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites! They love to stand up and
pray in the houses of worship and on the street corners, so that everyone will
see them. I assure you, they have already been paid in full. 6 But when you
pray, go to your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is
unseen. And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you.
7 "When you pray, do not use a lot of meaningless words, as the pagans do,
who think that their gods will hear them because their prayers are long. 8 Do
not be like them. Your Father already knows what you need before you ask
him. 9 This, then, is how you should pray:
'Our Father in heaven:
May your holy name be honored;
may your Kingdom come;
may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today the food we need.
Forgive us the wrongs we have done,
as we forgive the wrongs that others have done to us.
Do not bring us to hard testing, but keep us safe from the Evil One.'
14"If you forgive others the wrongs they have done to you, your Father in
heaven will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others, then your
Father will not forgive the wrongs you have done.
Teaching about Fasting
16"And when you fast, do not put on a sad face as the hypocrites do. They
neglect their appearance so that everyone will see that they are fasting. I
assure you, they have already been paid in full. 17 When you go without food,
wash your face and comb your hair, 18 so that others can not know that you are
fasting-only your Father, who is unseen, will know. And your Father, who
sees what you do in private, will reward you.
Riches in Heaven (Luke 12.33-34)
19"Do not store up riches for yourseves here on earth, where moths and rust
destroy, and robbers break in and steal. 20 Instead, store up riches for
yourselves in heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy, and robbers connot
break in and steal. 21 For your heart will always be where your riches are.
The Light of the Body (Luke 11.34-36)
22"The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are sound, your
whole body will be full of light; 23 but if your eyes are no good, your body will
be in darkness. So if the light in you is darkness, how terribly dark it
will be!
God and Possessions (Luke 16.13;12.22-31)
24"No one can be a slave to two masters; he will hate one and love the
other; he will be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God
and money. 25"This is why I tell you: do not be worried about the food and
drink you need in order to stay alive, or about clothes for your body, After
all, isn't life worth more than food? And isn't the body worth more than
clothes? 26 Look at the birds: they do not plant seeds, gather a harvest and put it
in barns; yet your Father in heaven takes care of them! Aren't you worth much
more than birds? 27 Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it?
28"And why worry about clothes? Look how the wild flowers grow: they do not
work or make clothes for themselves. 29 But I tell you that not even King
Solomon with all his wealth had cloths as beautiful as one of these flowers. 30
It is God who clothes the wild grass-grass that is here today and gone
tomorrow, burned up in the oven. Won't he be all the more sure to clothe you? What
little faith you have!
31"So do not start worrying:'Where will my food come from? or my drink? or
my clothes?' 32 (These are the things the pagans are always concerned about.)
Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things. 33 Instead, be
concerned above everything else with the Kingdom of God and with what he
requires of you, and he will provide you with all these other things. 34 So do not
worry about tomorrow; it will have enough worries of its own. There is no
need to add to the troubles each day brings.
Judging Others (Luke 6.37-38, 41-42)
7"Do not judge others, so that God will not judge you, 2 for God will judge
you in the same way you judge others, and he will apply to you the same
rules you apply to others. 3 Why, then, do you look at the speck in your
brother's eye and pay no attention to the log in your own eye? 4 How dare you say to
your brother,'Please, let me take that speck out of your eye.' when you have
a log in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own
eye, and then you will be able to see clearly to take the speck out of your
brother's eye.
6"Do not give what is holy to dogs-they will only turn and attack you. Do
not throw your pearls in front of pigs-they will only trample them underfoot.
Ask, Seek, Knock (Luke 11.9-13)
7"Ask, and you will recieve;seek, and you will find; knock, and the door
will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks will recieve, and anyone who
seeks will find, and the door will be opened to him who knocks. 9 Would any of
you who are fathers give your son a stone when he asks for bread? 10 Or would
you give him a snake when he ask for a fish? 11 As bad as you are, you know
how to give good things to your children. How much more, then, will your
Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
12"Do for others what you want them to do for you: this is the meaning of
the Law of Moses and of the teachings of the prophets.
The Narrow Gate (Luke 13.24)
13"Go in through the narrow gate, because the gate to hell is wide and the
road that leads to it is easy, and there are many who travel it. 14 But the
gate to life is narrow and the way that leads to it is hard, and there are few
people who find it.
A Tree and Its Fruit
(Luke 6:43-44)
15"Be on your guard against false prophets: they come to you looking like
sheep on the outside, but on the inside they are really like wild wolves. 16
You will know them by what they do. Thorn bushes do not bear grapes, and
briers do not bear figs. 17 A healthy tree bears goodfruit, but a poor tree bears
bad fruit. 18 A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a poor tree cannot
bear good fruit. 19 And any tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and
thrown in the fire. 20 So then, you will know thw false prophets by what they
I Never Knew You (Luke 13.25-27)
21"Not everyone who calls me 'Lord, Lord' will enter the Kingdom of heaven,
but only those who do what my Father in heaven wants them to do. 22 When the
Judgement Day comes, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord! In your name we spoke
God's message, by your name we drove out many demons and performed many
miracles!' 23 Then I will say to them,'I never knew you. Get away from me, you
wicked people!'
The Two House Builders (Luke 6.47-49)
24"So then, anyone who hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a
wise man who built his house on rock. 25 The rain poured down, the rivers
flooded over, and the wind blew hard against that house. But it did not fall,
because it was built on rock.
26"But anyone who hears these words of mine and does not obey them is like
a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain poured down, the
rivers flooded over, the wind blew hard against that house, and it fell. And what
a terrible fall that was!"
The Authority of Jesus 28 When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowd was amazed at the way
he taught. 29 He wasn't like the teachers of the Law; instead, he taught
with authority.

The Light of the Body (Luke 11.34-36)
22"The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are sound, your
whole body will be full of light; 23 but if your eyes are no good, your body will

and money. 25"This is why I tell you: do not be worried about the food and

more than birds? 27 Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it?
28"And why worry about clothes? Look how the wild flowers grow: they do not
work or make clothes for themselves. 29 But I tell you that not even King
Solomon with all his wealth had cloths as beautiful as one of these flowers. 30
It is God who clothes the wild grass-grass that is here today and gone
tomorrow, burned up in the oven. Won't he be all the more sure to clothe you? What
little faith you have!
31"So do not start worrying:'Where will my food come from? or my drink? or
my clothes?' 32 (These are the things the pagans are always concerned about.)
Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things. 33 Instead, be
concerned above everything else with the Kingdom of God and with what he

need to add to the troubles each day brings.
Judging Others (Luke 6.37-38, 41-42)
7"Do not judge others, so that God will not judge you, 2 for God will judge
you in the same way you judge others, and he will apply to you the same
rules you apply to others. 3 Why, then, do you look at the speck in your
brother's eye and pay no attention to the log in your own eye? 4 How dare you say to
your brother,'Please, let me take that speck out of your eye.' when you have
a log in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own

6"Do not give what is holy to dogs-they will only turn and attack you. Do
not throw your pearls in front of pigs-they will only trample them underfoot.
Ask, Seek, Knock (Luke 11.9-13)
7"Ask, and you will recieve;seek, and you will find; knock, and the door
will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks will recieve, and anyone who
seeks will find, and the door will be opened to him who knocks. 9 Would any of
you who are fathers give your son a stone when he asks for bread? 10 Or would
you give him a snake when he ask for a fish? 11 As bad as you are, you know
how to give good things to your children. How much more, then, will your
Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
12"Do for others what you want them to do for you: this is the meaning of
the Law of Moses and of the teachings of the prophets.
The Narrow Gate (Luke 13.24)
13"Go in through the narrow gate, because the gate to hell is wide and the
road that leads to it is easy, and there are many who travel it. 14 But the
gate to life is narrow and the way that leads to it is hard, and there are few

(Luke 6:43-44)
15"Be on your guard against false prophets: they come to you looking like
sheep on the outside, but on the inside they are really like wild wolves. 16
You will know them by what they do. Thorn bushes do not bear grapes, and
briers do not bear figs. 17 A healthy tree bears goodfruit, but a poor tree bears
bad fruit. 18 A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a poor tree cannot
bear good fruit. 19 And any tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and
thrown in the fire. 20 So then, you will know thw false prophets by what they
I Never Knew You (Luke 13.25-27)

God's message, by your name we drove out many demons and performed many
miracles!' 23 Then I will say to them,'I never knew you. Get away from me, you
wicked people!'
The Two House Builders (Luke 6.47-49)
24"So then, anyone who hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a
wise man who built his house on rock. 25 The rain poured down, the rivers
flooded over, and the wind blew hard against that house. But it did not fall,
because it was built on rock.
26"But anyone who hears these words of mine and does not obey them is like
a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain poured down, the
rivers flooded over, the wind blew hard against that house, and it fell. And what
a terrible fall that was!"
The Authority of Jesus 28 When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowd was amazed at the way
he taught. 29 He wasn't like the teachers of the Law; instead, he taught
with authority.
