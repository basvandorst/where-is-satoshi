@_subject: Re: Worm Klez.E immunity 
It's definitely a nasty little piece of code. Even though I had Outlook
Express configured to disallow practially everything, the E-mail messages
opened themselves and let the rogue code loose. If you've managed to avoid
Klez so far and you're running Windows, I strongly recommend you read more
about this at Microsoft and then install the recommended security patch:
AV software can't detect or clean it.
Once I got McAfee VirusScan installed, I was able to delete all the affected
files. BUT, it took a major effort (over two -- or was it three -- days) to
even get it installed so that I could scan my hard drive.
monitor maybe cry when you run it.
Not my idea of a solution to this problem because a) it won't do anything
about files that are already infected and b) I don't like the idea of a file
that causes a virus alert for which one is told to "Ignore the warning,and
select 'continue'."
