This isn't an area where we need to start reasoning from analogies or first principles - there's already case law more or less directly on point - _RIAA v. Napster_ and _RTC v. Netcom_, both of which look back to _Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction_ 76 F.3d 259 (9th Cir. 1996), online at  and discussed in the Napster context at The shippers could be held liable for the contents of the packages they carry if a plaintiff can establish that they knowingly materially contributed to the distribution or sale of infringing items. I suspect they avoid criminal liability by cooperating fully with law enforcement, so that even where they're technically guilty (or indictable) they have no realistic fear of prosecution; and that they avoid civil liability because domestic infringers will be attacked by IP holders directly, and foreign infringers will have their goods seized during Customs inspections, so Fedex et al never really get a chance to contribute to the infringement.

"New and additional" might be too strong, but one of the elements of contributory or vicarious copyright infringement is whether or not the defendant profited from the direct infringement - and changing remailing from an unpaid public service to an (apparently) for-profit business pretty much concedes that point to the plaintiff.

While it's understandable that people want to avoid being swept up in hysterical backlashes against people involved in this morning's terrorist activity, it's worth remembering - especially for people interested in aiding law enforcement - that a lot of investigations begin and move forward with anonymous tips which are later corroborated by witnesses willing to testify. Given the clear indifference for human life shown by the terrorists, the ordinary witness-protection steps taken by law enforcement may not be comforting enough to allow aiders and abettors of this morning's actions to report their knowledge with confidence - so it may be more important than ever that the remailers continue to operate.
Given that, does anyone have any tips for compiling the current Mixmaster release under FreeBSD or OpenBSD? The make fails for me on both platforms - it looks like a failure related to the recent integration of OpenSSL into the standard BSD distributions, which I've been unable to remedy thus far.

I think remailers are ideally run either by people/organizations with very few resources (so they're not attractive litigation targets) or substantial resources (so they can defend themselves vigorously & aggressively vs. litigation) and right now I find myself somewhere in between those two poles. Nevertheless, the events of the past few days have changed the risk/benefit ratio such that I believe the risks of inaction on my part are worse than the risks of acting.

I get the impression that our anonymous correspondent Nomen Nescio (n.b., "nomen nescio" is Latin for "I do not know the the name") is suffering from overexposure to academic discussion, which leads (in some cases) to the impression that the world is full of important policy questions patiently awaiting discussion and analysis ad infinitum (and ad nauseum) by anyone who cares to play Socrates today - and that, pending resolution of irresolvable questions, no action shall be taken, and ongoing activities frozen, until perfect consensus can be reached or a widely-acclaimed policy can be drafted.
I propose that this sort of discussion - about whether or not, in the face of violence and tragedy, some aspect of human freedom and expression can be suitably "justified" to satisfy every self-appointed devil's advocate - is absolutely unproductive and serves only to suck energy and concentration from more interesting projects.
I don't know (and don't care) if Nomen is an authentic participant in cypherpunks, a nom-de-plume of another subscriber used to advance unpopular arguments (perhaps in hopes of eliciting stronger arguments in favor of that person's real beliefs), an agent provocateur, or something else .. Nomen's internal state is unimportant. The effect of his/her messages is to create a swamp of self-referential argument and discussion which advances nothing; and I suggest that we'd all do well to learn to ignore Nomen as many of us do Choate (and Vulis and Detweiler in times past.)
Accordingly, I will not answer Nomen's arguments or questions, but report that I have succeeded in compiling Mixmaster 2.9beta23 on the FreeBSD 4.4 release candidate, and in concert with other cpunks, am putting together a 2.9beta24 package which includes a number of patches recently circulated. We have assembled and are testing an installation of that new release on a well-connected machine in a favorable jurisdiction, with more "hardened" remailer installations on the way.

People believe that their experience as a subject of control and the exercise of power makes them safe - and that the feeling of not being controlled, or the idea that others are not being actively controlled (or at least monitored, to ensure that their internalized controls are functioning) is scary to them.

Earlier I mentioned that I was having difficulty building the current Mixmaster on FreeBSD - I'm confident that I've identified the problem.
Specifically, the OpenSSL that's integrated into FreeBSD doesn't include IDEA, by default, because of patent concerns. To remedy that, one needs to change the line in /etc/defaults/make.conf so that it reads "MAKE_IDEA=YES".
Then - this is the part I missed before - it's necessary to recompile the system libraries, so that they're rebuilt with IDEA support included. It sounds simple in retrospect . . . go to /usr/src and run "make buildworld; make installworld", which may take 12 hours or so on a slow PC. There's got to be a better way to just rebuild the crypto parts, but I didn't stumble across it yet.
After those steps are completed, the Mixmaster stuff builds and runs happily. Mixmaster 2.9beta23 is available at  or I suspect that the OpenBSD fix will be similar, but it may take some time to track it all down.

What you seem to be missing is that the approx 1000 people now being held haven't been "incarcerated for a fucked up deed" - they're being held for what's probably a spectrum of reasons, ranging from "found in an airport with a one-way plane ticket, a boxcutter, and a forged passport on the morning of 9/11" to "gave a cop too much attitude while having a non-Western name". But we don't know who's being held, nor for how long, nor what the reasons are, or the evidence which establishes that the "reasons" have some relationship to reality.
We have a special process for deciding who's done fucked up deeds and thus deserving of punishment, and it's called a trial.
After these people have had one, then we can argue about what ought to happen to them. Until then - and/or at least until the evidence against these people has been made public and subjected to scrutiny - we don't know whether these people are Mother Teresa or Satan himself or somewhere in If we're going to start beating and torturing and killing people pretrial (paying special attention to foreigners who may not fully agree with our culture or values), exactly how is the ruling regime in the US different from the ruling regime in Afghanistan? The only aspect left that I can see that's different would be a nominally secular vs religious basis, but I don't trust Ashcroft to respect that for long.
Pretrial detention is not supposed to suck, it's supposed to be minimally burdensome, to the extent that's compatible with making sure people show up for trial, don't commit further crimes, and don't cost an exorbitant amount of staff attention.
(* This isn't meant as a claim that what we had prior to 9/11 in terms of trials, pretrial detention, or any of the other criminal procedure features was what it's advertised to be, or that it was compatible with the Constitution - but I still regard the abandonment of even the pretense of complying with the Constitution as a significant step towards some very serious trouble.)

Well, I don't know what's the CDC's concerns are, but nasal swabs seem likely to answer one question - "does this person presently have anthrax spores inside their nasal passage?" which is different in several important ways from other questions of interest, including -
Has this person been exposed to anthrax bacteria or spores in the last 60 - 90 days?
Has this person's immune system created antibodies to the anthrax bacteria?
Have this person's lymph nodes become infected? Are toxins being produced?
Some people may have anthrax spores in their nose but no infection (perhaps they were exposed to far fewer than the 5-10000 spores needed for inhalational anthrax) and some people may have an infection but no spores in their nose (because they have cutaneous anthrax, or because they blew their nose a lot, or because they're frequent users of powderered inhaled drugs like cocaine or amphetamine and don't have hair inside their noses).
So - if the purpose of the test is to determine which people need medical treatment - the test is likely to be misleading, sometimes optimistically, sometimes pessimistically.

I don't mind mirroring Cryptome, but I'm pretty wary of installing other people's newly-hacked-up code in a [quasi-]production environment .. your proposal creates two kinds of risk. The first, which is relatively familiar by now, is content risk, from people angry about the content .. the second is the risk of security problems in the code or its configuration/installation, and that sounds like a bigger issue to me.
Why not just use one of the existing distributed systems for this content? If you put content in the Gnutella or Kazaa systems, you can give us filenames or search strings and then we just make locally cached copies and leave machines running (even crappy little windows boxes) to create dispersed hard-to-clobber-them-all content. If you put it in the Mojo/Freenet/BitTorrent systems, and make the URLs of the content publically available, helpful people can make local copies of all or parts of your files pretty easily, too.
Or, alternately, make just content available as a .zip or .tgz, and let others serve it using FTP/HTTP servers they're already familiar with.

Well, no. "Martial law" usually implies that civil authorities have been replaced or overriden by military command, and that civilian law is not in effect, having been replaced by orders from a military command structure; and it's usually imposed on formerly hostile territory, or territories considered very close to conflict spatially or temporally.
That has not happened in the US, except arguably at the ground zero site, and even there it sounds like it's civilian police officers and elected officials, not military officers, who are setting policy.
Unconstitutional, in many cases? I think so. Martial law? No, that's not accurate. That term has historically meant a lot more that some National Guard troops in the airports.

What an asshole.
Oracle talked the City of Oakland into adopting Oracle Financials to run the city's books and payroll - the project ran months over deadline (past 1/1/2000, even though it was being installed to fix a Y2K problem with the existing installation), resulted in withholding errors and missed paychecks for city workers, missing reports for budget purposes, and generally created an administrative and accounting nightmare. Deep into the project, the Oracle consultants admitted that they'd promised to do things for Oakland that they'd never done before, that they weren't sure how long it would take to finish, or if the promised functionality would ever be I don't know if they ever finished.

I didn't see anywhere where Stu Baker said that he thought this was constitutional and/or within the original text of CALEA - the quoted bits I saw had him saying that the FBI is drafting regulations which proceed on the assumption that they can consider ISP's within CALEA's regulatory reach. He talked about the FBI's position, not his position.
I don't think he's likely to take a hard-and-fast stance one way or the other on this; he's way too smart to get hung out to dry with a totally ridiculous position on a black-or-white legal or factual (or political) question. I don't agree with his balancing of security vs. privacy when answering policy questions, but he's also very good at what he does and represents his clients well; a former employer of mine got some help from him which was a godsend at the time, despite what I suspect was his personal opposition (or at least ambivalence) towards our mission.
He's a gun-for-hire, not a doctrinaire blinders-on true believer for either the surveillance enthusiasts or privacy freaks.
If he's talking about the FBI's reading of CALEA so that it reaches ISP's, that may be a good early warning that we're likely to see lots of the Beltway crew agreeing - the question is not whether some random cypherpunk thinks that's a fair reading of CALEA, the question is whether or not a federal judge thinks that's a fair reading, and things like this are valuable clues if you're interested in that narrow question.
CALEA implementation has been slow - if the FBI is drafting regs now, they're going to have to go through the administrative rulemaking process (which I expect they can abbreviate in an "emergency"), publish final regs, and give ISP's at least a short time to comply - so we're still talking about months or years, not hours or days, so it's way too early for tech people to expect to hear about this via work.
