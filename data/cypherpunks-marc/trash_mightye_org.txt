Do you suppose that the JAP operators were under a court order to not disclose that they were logging these attempts?  The text you quoted from the application simply screams LOOK and may have been a deliberate attempt to get someone to notice.  They may have been ordered to install the back door, not tell anyone about it, and not tell anyone that they weren't allowed to talk about it.  Once it was public knowledge, however, they may have been able to discuss that there was indeed a court order to this effect, but still perhaps forbidden from discussing the limitations on talking about it.  I'm not sure what German law is, but it's also further possible that they were ordered to bring the service back up with the back door in place, removing any capacity for them to behave in the manner that you state they should have.
People who hold ideals like the JAP operators, and stick their necks out for those ideals by doing things like offering anonymizing services don't strike me as the sort of people who are given to compromise these ideals given that they have any option on the matter.  JAP operators are not interested in sheltering criminals, and thus are not likely interested in BEING criminals themselves when faced with a court order requiring them to do something against their ideals.
