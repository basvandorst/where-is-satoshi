@_subject: Re: [pfSense] NSA: Is pfSense infiltrated by "big brother" NSA or others? 
I rarely participate in public political discussions but I have to say some=
In the United States if the government sent someonean NSL - they would not =
be allowed to comment. You have been told that already and have been told t=
hat to the best knowledge of the people involved, no other requests have be=
en received.
You have turned this into a political discussion and I think at least I do =
not care about your political views. Yes, we all know NSA is evil and no, m=
ost of us do not like it.
Now, do you have a technical question on how to "protect yourself" from the=
 evil spooks? If not, please go away, this is becoming boring.
Yes, it is an open public list but it does not mean it is your outlet to ve=
nt and abuse others.
