I wasn't watching the scene with the intention of being able to recall it
fully afterwards, but I remember it rather differently.  I recall Ed saying
releasing all of the documents Wikileaks-style would an ideal outcome, but
because it included information that should be legitimately redacted, he
instead wanted to filter the material through journalists who would make
that judgement call.  Also, Greenwald said he was under a deadline, and I
think you'll agree it was in everyone's best interests to start to get the
information out as quickly as possible.
But, I could be misremembering.
