@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] questions about bitcoin-XT code fork & non-consensus hard-fork 
adequately handle the situation when blocks fill up
This will have to eventually be done in addition to any other "alternative"
unless the plan is to keep rising the limit until it is removed or
Maybe this should be the priority? Maybe this is the "alternative" that
some no-block-size-limit proponents (meaning people who think that
centralization is not a concern when deciding the block size limit) claim
nobody was putting forward?
Anyway, it's sad that we're always mixing 2 different topics: hardfork
deployment and blocksize limit. I wish we talked more about the former, I
wish we would have talked about it it long before the block size debate
became "urgent" (or at least before it was being perceived as urgent).
We've had plenty of time to deploy non-emergency hardforks but apparently
no one was interested (say, for fixing miner but known bugs like the
timetravel attack).
In fact, I plan to eventually propose such a fork, I agree with gavin that
"hardforks aren't possible" is not an answer, though finding opposition to
a concrete hardfork in a concrete point in time doesn't mean that
"hardforks aren't possible". I believe I have proposed many more hardforks
than Gavin, all of them rejected and I still hope some of them will
eventually make it into bitcoin main.
When it was clear that wouldn't be the case I'm afraid the only answer is
creating an altcoin (like Mark and I did with Freicoin and "xtcoin" could
become [hopefully not destroying bitcoin main in the process]).
