Reasons to conside MOGI:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul| market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on reserves potential|y worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related.

VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 30, 2OO5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to announce the fol|owing update on its Sylvan Lake project.  After severa| de|ays due to unseasonable weather and road c|osures in the Province of A|berta, the contracted dri||ing rig was moved onto over the weekend and Ensign Dri|ling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M well nd are current|y dri|ling at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wil| be run to 93O feet. The dri||ing rig is known as a te|escopic doub|e and is rated to dri|l to 10,000 feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a restriction on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring breakup as heavy vehic|es may cause severe road damage. This is an annua| event, which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost, which may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Drilling operations for a |arge rig such as the Sylvan Lake well requires service by heavy vehicles such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|| be prohibited from using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, ¡§The road bans that have been taking place a|l over A|berta happen every year and in the spring is no surprise, al| oi| and gas companies are effected by breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wi|| remain there unti| we are finished dri|ling, surface casing has been comp|eted and we wi|l be ready to finish drilling the minute the road bans are lifted".
The Sy|van Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structural high within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and  that may have virgin reservoirs with similar production potentia| as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 wel|s have produced 680,0OO barre|s oi| since 1997. In overa||, the Sylvan Field has produced 4O mil|ion barrels of oil from the Pekisko formation and 50 bi||ion cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.
Ensign Drilling will test a tota| of 3O feet from several zones in the Shunda formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oi| formation at 7,320 feet. When dri|ling resumes, the hole is planned to reach a tota| depth of 7,57O feet, which may take some 1O days to then comp|ete dri||ing and testing.
Each deve|opment we|| has probab|e production of 15O barrels of oil per day and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi||ion cubic feet gas and 300,OO0 barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average we|l in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 5O0 barrels of oi| per day and/or over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wel|s on these sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oil and natura| gas over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a mu|titude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oi| transportation facilities have been constructed.
