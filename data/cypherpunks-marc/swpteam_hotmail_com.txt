Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following.
This is
the letter you have been hearing about on the news
Due to the popularity of this letter on the
Internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can
make people money.
The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. Their findings proved once and
for all that there are ''absolutely NO laws
prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are
bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of
pocket cost''.
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED; IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to
see what one could expect in return for the minimal
and money required. To my astonishment, I received
total $
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming
in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
