Thanks Steve.  As you know, of course, IAARL.  And I know and have worked with Paul.  I don't normally do me-too posts, and I don't normally post to this list at all; but I do want to me too this.  I've been pointing folks to Paul's piece since the day (a weeks ago) he first published it, it's well worth reading.
