@_subject: Re: 27C3 on Tor 
And I thought this was why it says somewhere in DOCs or FAQ that a user
can better hide what she does if her own tor client also transmits relay
traffic. This is the strongest point of tor against other anon systems
with less users: The more people use it, the more likely it "wasn't me".
It would be interesting to experiment if a relatively low RelaySpeed
(e.g. 10KB/s) setting would already attract enough traffic to always
sufficiently hide the users own activities.
