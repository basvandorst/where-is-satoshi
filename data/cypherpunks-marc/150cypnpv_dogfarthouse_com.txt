Hello, my name is Amy ...First off I would like to thank you for responding...Let   me tell you a little bit about myself.   I'm 34 and I've been married for 13 years to the same man. It is a mock of a   marriage but we're still together for the sake of our two children. There was   certainly a time when I truly did believe in the vows of for better or for worse,   and I can honestly say that until recently the thought of breaking those vows   (no matter how loveless the marriage has been), was only a thought...About six   months ago I realized I was being played for a fool by my "other half."   Not only was I hurt but I was embarassed that is was my sister who came to me   and told me she saw him in public all over another woman ... Well, since then   there has been a lot of pain and anger to process but, here I am hoping to find   my own slice of pie. I'm a little bit apprehensive/nervous about putting myself   out here like this...but I'm also really excited...my sister helped me find   the right site and set me up with a little web cam...I know other women who   have had a lot of sucess with their pursuits in the world of online relationships,   and I feel really hopeful for myself...I'm easy to get a long with, intelligent,   attractive and at the moment, a little bit of attention and affection would   go a long way.. If you can put a smile on my face, I promise I'll put a smile   on yours. So having said all that, if you think you would like to meet me you   can find me __ here . press this   link to meet me :))))))))))
  I look forward to getting much more personal with you...   amy gardner
