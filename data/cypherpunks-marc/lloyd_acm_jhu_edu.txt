Out of curiosity, does anyone know what kind of data rates one can get from
the RNG built into those oh-so-commodity i8xx motherboards? I don't have
one, else I would just go time a read loop. And has anyone ever done an
analysis of the output? Last I heard (~2.5 years ago?) Intel was refusing
to release the design for inspection. Has that changed since?

These techniques remind me of Lion and Bear
( Lion is pretty
fast, too, with the right parameters (of a stream cipher + hash function).
It would be easy to modify either to take a block count so you wouldn't
need to store the extra IV. Just another thing to think about, I guess. -J

Depending on how good your local library is, they may be able to get you a

If ITU works anything like the ABA, they'll charge you about $4/page to get
one of these from them (at least that's the rate X9.19 came to). PKCS and
other online sources seem your best bet for this by far.

Also with RSA, if you know p/q, you should probably check to see if they're
actually prime. :)
For DSA, assuming only one of the keys has been changed, checking y == g^x
mod p should detect it. Again, checking primality (and that q divides p-1)
seems prudent.

You can also do this with DH (use a pair of DH keys, one long term and the
other for that single exchange). IEEE 1363 includes this as well as MQV. I
don't know how the security compares between these two options, though.

I agree that making them mandatory requirements for new machines will do
more than enough, without having to bother to make old machines illegal.
Plenty. Most are so old as to be virtually useless by modern standards, but
Even more. And I think it likely that they will be more useful than
currently 10 year old machines, as well.
Why do I think that? Mostly because Intel/AMD/Dell/co are having such an
awful time trying to sell the latest and greatest whiz-bang stuff. Back 'in
the day', virtually _any_ speed increase was worth buying. But at this
point, unless you've got something really special in mind, you can often
stay a generation or two (or three) back without any problems at all. Also,
pretty much any machine made in the last couple of years is fast enough to
do real time audio capture and compression. Real time video still requires
something fairly high end, but give it a year.
Not to say that having DRM hardware will not be a total pain the ass. Just
that mass-scale piracy will still be very much possible. But I suppose they
already know that.

Shapiro has a strange love for Javascript. I don't know what that has to do
with OpenCM either way, though... In any case, if you were running EROS you
wouldn't have to worry about Javascript causing you problems. :P
