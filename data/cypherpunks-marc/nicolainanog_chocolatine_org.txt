Agreed.  Although some people are uncomfortable with OpenSSL's track record,
and don't want to trade system security for better-than-plaintext
network security.
But the deeper issue is coercing providers to give up mail stored on
private servers, bypassing the network altogether.  TLS doesn't address
this problem.  Short term: deploy [START]TLS.  Long term: we need a new
email protocol with E2E encryption.

That's true -- it is far easier to subvert email than most other
services, and in the case of email we probably need a wholly new

I think Joe 6mbps sitting at home reads that everything he uses has been
subverted.  He doesn't know what alternatives exist, and doesn't have
the technical knowledge neccessary to find them on his own.  And faced
with a false choice -- stop using the Internet, or continue using it as
he knows how -- he chooses the one that retains his ability to
communicate with family and friends and keep up on the things he cares
Schneier is saying we need to build better options for Joe 6mbps,
competing with the PRISM-compatable services, so that privacy-respecting
services become known and commonplace.
