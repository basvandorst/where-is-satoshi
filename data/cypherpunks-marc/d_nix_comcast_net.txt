Hash: SHA1
I've seen little or no discussion of Bitmessage, and was wondering
what thoughts - pro or con - people have of it:
I've got it up and running and have exchanged messages with a friend
and well as a few other folks testing the waters. One thing I like
about it, is that it seems at first glance to not suffer from the same
sort of traffic analysis issues that plague regular email; to me, the
traffic analysis problems are a bigger issue than message encryption.
One could also paste PGP/GPG or other encrypted content into
Bitmessage for your super duper secret stuff where you are concerned
the recipients machine is compromised.
There's apparently a standard email gateway for it also:
Tho, that may bring you back to the problems of traffic analysis.
I'd also love to see more mix network stuff getting developed so we
could help secure against traffic analysis of existing systems. Tom
Ritter's talk on analyzing mix network traffic was quite cool:
But anyhow, Bitmessage; yay or nay?

The question isn't whether it's what it claims to be.  It is that.  But
is it's *more* than it claims to be.
Yes, in my haste I neglected the "only" disclaimer bit; it is indeed a
means by which the *rightful owner/administrator* might perform very
useful tasks. The obvious crux of the biscuit is *who else* has
access, and what can they do surreptitiously?
If for example, the paper regarding manipulating the RNG circuit by
alternate chip doping is valid, then an adversary with deep pockets
and vast resources might well be able remotely target specific systems
on demand. Possibly even air gapped ones if this function is
controllable via a 3G signal as I have read elsewhere.
Or perhaps just outright reroute and tap information prior to
encryption, or subtly corrupt things in other ways such that processes
fail or leak data. A universal on-demand STUXNET, if you will... Yes,
idle unfounded speculation, I know... but still... these days the fear
is that we're not paranoid enough.
Hmmmm. Maybe time to pull my old 1996 SGI R10K and R4400 boxes out of
storage. For a few *very* dedicated and air gapped tasks they might be
a small measure of worthwhile trouble.

Hah hah hah. Uh, reading between the lines, color me *skeptical* that
this is really what it claims to be, given the current understanding
of things...

All I've ever seen is plain text. I use Thunderbird and I keep "view
message body as plain text" toggled on always, so no matter the source
- - gmail, yahoo, VT100, it's always plain text. But even cycling thru
the various htnl options, it looks the same.
I still think the content may be clever steganography or a deranged
AI, but the format seems fine to me...

Correction; Callas worked on Threefish, not Twofish, however the
Schneier connection still holds given their past and present

Yeah, it may well be just marketing. The one thing that gives me pause
is that Callas and Schneier are both part of the team that worked on
the systems they have chosen to migrate to (Twofish, Skein), and
Schneier is one of the very few people to see the Snowden docs (or
some subset thereof).
Might be reading too much into things but...

Then there is this:

Thanks Peter, Coderman-
Kinda what I suspected seeing as they are *Application Specific* IC's
after all... Wishful thinking more than anything knowing that they are
now saturating their market and loosing value rapidly.

Hash: SHA1
Curious; anyone know much about what these inexpensive (comparatively,
price seems steadily falling) ASIC Block Erupter USB Bitcoin miners
can be adapted to doing? Could they be repurposed as RNG sources?
I know they are designed / programmed for running the SHA256 hashing
employed in mining Bitcoin, but as the difficulty rate goes up, their
value in that arena becomes less and less...
Just wondering if they might find new life as inexpensive RNGs. Any
pointers to the circuit or the code they run?
Disclaimer: I have no idea if this is even remotely a valid or good
idea... But a cheap hardware thumb drive RNG might be useful, no?
