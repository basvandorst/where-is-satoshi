Snitch Nation
You're listening to us
You're listen to us right now
So we'll tell you right now
We don't got no keys up in this house
Put the guns down
We're not building bombs in the basement
To the NSA, say "Turn them fucking cameras on yourself."
Mark of the beast in my pocket
It's an invasion
They built the cages
They own the block
They digitized the block
And gave us bigger cages
3-D printed humans
With sudo expressions
Call it freedom
Pale mothafuckaz
In data collection centers
Who can't tell if I'm kidding
When I say I'm a overthrow the Government
Put ice cream machines in place of ATMs
And empty all the prisons
They made us into spies
Snitching on ourselves
For the eater of time
The co-opter of our souls
We throw death threats at a dead world
I've got everything to hide from folks like you
Why you wanna watch me naked
Screaming "Fuck the police" in my living room
How you gonna stop me
From pissing on every electric fence
You're invisible armies couldn't even find sand on a fucking beach
Line us up
Shoot us all
Family portraits taken from a satellite abroad
So smile and wink up at the cameras
For the snitches in the sky
Google mapping all our bloody insides
Microchip in my passport
Got my WEP encrypted password
So it still feels like I'm in a prison
And a pig is searching in my asshole
Freedom is a concept we will never know
Every time I breath, every time I sleep
I've seen the devil's face
Drawn in ASCII patterns
Plastered across the heavens
Are binary masters
On the planet
God knows every path we're on
Dammit omnipotent digital deities
Listening to every word that we're speaking
So every time that I scream "Fuck You"
On a track there is a transcript on a computer in real-time
Fuck you
Better put a bullet in my head for me to trust you
I'm an ant on a hill dodging magnifying glass reflections
Still it's Fuck You
What you think
We got all these eyes for
All I see is secret agents
Marching up and down my spine
Trying to copywrite my DNA
While I learn to walk
We don't talk much any more
Talk is dead, like privacy
Toxic oceans are coming
To swallow every city
And when I'm gone
I leave it all
To the cockroaches
But I can't forget the drones
Can't forget the drones
No I can't forget the drones
Can't forget the drones
No I can't forget the drones
Can't forget the drones
No I can't forget the drones
Can't forget the drones
No I can't forget the drones
Can't forget the drones
No I can't forget the drones
Can't forget the drones
Sole & Ceschi
