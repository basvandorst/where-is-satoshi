We had a guy (aka potential customer) inquire the other day about hosting a
Tor exit on our infrastructure the other day;  he disappeared fairly
quickly when he figured out that we weren't just going to give him an
endless supply of unmetered 10G bandwidth.  I was looking forward to
billing him.  :-)
I'm not sure that armchair lawyering, here, actually helps anyone.  Also,
spel-chek, sequitur.
