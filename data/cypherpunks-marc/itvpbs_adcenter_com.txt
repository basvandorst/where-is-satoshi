Great News Release - JUST RELEASED
Apr 12, 2004 -- ViaStar Media Corporation. (VISH)
announced today that Mr. William T. Walker, Jr., a
former member of the American Stock Exchange Advisory
Committee and the Pacific Stock Exchange, has been
appointed to the company's Board of Directors Viastar Holdings Inc. ("OTCBB: VISH") has positioned
itself in the gap between the major media
conglomerates and the universe of independent music,
film, and publishing companies. The company has
existing music, film, distribution and production
capabilities, a current roster of prominent artists,
publishing interest worldwide and seasoned industry
executives. These facts, coupled with our well
established international distribution division,
gives Viastar the marketing muscle and enhanced
gross profitability of a major, while retaining the
flexibility, creative freedom and economies of scale
of an independent. By owning its distribution pipeline,
Viastar has direct control over the flow of its
products to 20,000 plus retail outlets, thus our gross
margins are effectively double that of a traditional
content provider; and we are not at the mercy of
outside distribution to receive payment for our
products. As a result, Viastar is a "major
independent" in the entertainment industry, recreating
the studio system that made Hollywood profitable and
powerful. What distinguishes Viastar from its
competition is its possession and control of the
"complete pipeline" enabling it to produce and place
its intellectual property on the shelves of retailers
worldwide and thus in the hands of millions of
consumers. Like Industry Leaders Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros.,
Viastar boasts a powerful in-house arsenal that includes
an aggressive product development division for music,
film and television; an international distribution
network of major retail chains, servicing more than
20,000 retail locations worldwide; a complete state-
of-the-art marketing & promotions department; and a
carefully hand-picked management team possessing
unrivaled talent and industry visibility who maximize
every extension of our efforts.
            We Expect Very Strong Demand For
                 This, Don't Miss it!
