lol, sounds similar to what a certain famous beetle had to say about it,
only more bible flavored.  ;-)

Thanks so  much Ceci,  I  will definitely stick around.  I noticed in  my
previous  email  I misspelled Steganography, which  is  so funny  because
I'm  always so particular about that.  lol.  Anyhow, there is  always
chaff  with the wheat and I'd  rather tolerate  the trolls and have  proper
un-moderated freedom of  conversation than to  receive a  curated list of
what  somebody  else  things is  important  and on topic. Your welcoming
tone  is  very much appreciated.  It's  been a  while since I  did
anything  interesting  (to me  at least) in cryptography but it has been
one of my life-long obsessions so I'm hear to learn and to get my mind
thinking about these things again. Lately I've been working on some
blockchain tech for business, just relaying payments and such for our
clients, but I have a few ideas which I'll be introducing as they become
more clear to me, and more practical for real world application. Nothing
amazing so far, but I like the idea of contributing to the movement where I
can. best regards, joe

I'm fairly new, and I became aware of this list because of block-chain
tech, but I am a developer with a libertarian leaning philosophy. I've
spent quite a lot of time in the subject of RnD on Cryptography with
special emphasis in stenography. So I'm sure btc has not attracted all the
wrong folks. Anyhow, the future has just begun and it might be just a tad
too early to become fully jaded, but that's just my opinion. Figured I'd
say hi :-) I'm curious as to what the different member's special interests
are in regards to internet security. It would be good to hear about what
people are working on or what they are interested in. -joe

Some wisdom  here "Protect your  people,  your family,  your honor.
Respect  the wiseness of the older  ones and  teach  the younger  ones
how  to be good  persons,  trying  to  keep pure their  hearts and souls.
Study all the days of your life,  never  stop  studying. Respect and
honor  your parents  and  your family's traditions.  Respect your
wife/husband and  your  eventual sons and  daughters. They  will be your
blood and flesh and you will live in their lives, even when your bones
become dust and your name becomes a pretty far memory. Don't be lazy or
selfish. Be grateful for being alive and keep surviving." Thank you
Cecilia. I also consider myself an Atheist, but I still firmly believe that
people with differing opinions from my own still deserve the respect I
would like them to give me. It brings a smile to my face to see this wisdom
being spread.

A friend mentioned to me that it's queued up to be offered on coinbase, so
that may have something to do with the rise in value. I know that eth, ltc
went up after appearing on coinbase. Just speculation there.

No real offence intended but, to me it seems obvious that your arguments
are logically flawed and I'm not going to waste my time, but I will say
your contrarianism is actually kinda entertaining in a sadistic sort of
way. I really am only expressing my opinions, I could be wrong, but I
really don't think I am, really it's just a matter of perspective. There
are givers and there are takers in this world, and when there are more
givers than takers the world becomes a better place. However the trend,
which indeed I assume you are a good example of, for people these days
seems to be towards takers and zero-sum minded people. Which is something I
hope to discourage. This all of course is philosophical and not technical,
I have a preference for discussing real technical matters in regards to
crypto, cryptocurrencies, algorithm ideas, privacy assurance, and
steganography (favorite cipher), and of course sharing of industry related
news and insights. I hope you all have a great day. :-)

Sure, it's their computer, but they chose to visit a site which is not
theirs, One that was created and maintained by somebody else. It costs to
create and host sites, if there is no means for monetization then the
likely macro repercussion is less sites or more pay-sites. Perhaps someday
on some sites you may choose:  1. micro-crypto payments. 2. give me ads. 3.
allow my browser to mini-mine crypto for the site owner. 4. by donation ie
wikipedia.... There is no free lunch, the attitude that people should get
something for nothing in my opinion is a cancer to society.

Google prepares publishers for the release of Chrome ad-blocking
 -- Personally, I consider
ad-blocking a form of theft, and yes, privacy concerns can be in conflict
to this idealism unfortunately. Be careful folks, google may become the
"police" of the internet if you let them. :-/ They make their money from
ads, so is this an attempt to kill the little guy before they grow to
become a competitor?? Should we not let the free market decide these
things?!   *Joseph Frazier*
