@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] questions about bitcoin-XT code fork & non-consensus hard-fork 
you cannot have it.
Neither do you or anyone else.
And it allows the minority to hold the majority hostage.
about to take them with community-owned Bitcoin and Other People's Money!
The same can be said about the other camp.
BitcoinXT is not going to fork the chain on a specific date no matter what.
People will be able to vote via block versions and once a sufficient
majority supports the extensions, everyone else will have a grace period to
upgrade. Only after that is a very small minority at risk of losing money.
That being said, I'd rather see a solution that everyone agrees on. My
personal opinion/hope is that Mike and Gavin are just applying pressure
where it's needed. But in the end, they can do whatever they want if they
have the necessary support. Permissionless innovation is one of bitcoins
virtues. In the end, only adoption will decide what bitcoin is and isn't.
