Let me recommend the IXmaps project. It is documenting the very question =
you are asking :)
IXmaps is an interactive tool that enables internet users and =
researchers to study the route(s) that data packets take across North =
America, with 'interesting' sites highlighted along the way. It is =
currently under development. It has been supported by a research grant =
from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada's =
Image, Text, Sound and Technology program.
IXmaps is affiliated with the New Transparency Project and the =
Information Policy Research Program at theFaculty of Information, =
University of Toronto.

From the news i've read... a couple of questions for the pfsense developers come to mind:
1. Random Number generation
- NSA is reported to have weakened several random number generators and/or introduced vulnerabilities. - What is used in PFsense?
2. Crypto
- Certain protocols have been deliberately weakened, have options that turn on crypto and/or known to contain backdoors.
- a robust discussion on how to enable the "highest" standard of encryption and privacy protective options would be most welcome
