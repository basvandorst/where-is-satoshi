Doesn't have to be proprietary. One of our pseudo-products is a PDF

Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I have heard of it. I'd even use it for
more than attempting to read .docs, if I didn't find vim to be superior
for just about everything I do with text.
OO even parses some documents well, most of the time. Which is of course
not good enough.
When you're dealing with folks that edit, re-edit, pass around, turn on
revision tracking, fast save, pass the document around some more, turn
off revision tracking, and then email you the file, It chokes. Hard.
As Bill said, input formats are not output formats.

Yes, as a matter of fact. RTF is an MS format, BTW. They do change it
sometimes, breaking various attempts at interoperability. They don't do
it much; it seems like something they forget to break much of the time.
No, there's no gun to anyone's head. However, as part of negotiating my current contract (I'm a partner in a small software development
company), we recieved lots of MS Word/Excel docs. When you're
negotiating new business, saying "erm, I don't do windows. Can you give
me something else" is a bit of a show stopper. By comparison, if you're
selling someone a car, are you going to stop them mid-sale and ask that
they please haggle in Euros? (And in case you're curious, our project is entirely open source driven.)
For that matter, one can drive without a license.
I see your distinction, however it is very difficult to do business
without MS software. I'm typing this on a Linux-running laptop, which is
my primary user-level machine, and in order to do business, have to run
Crossover. (And I do own my MS Office license.) All of my proposals are
written in plain text and sometimes, done in Postgres when I need
spreadsheet-like behavior. They have to be rendered in Word format for
client consumption. (Open source spreadsheets still suck, in my
That's a rather fine point to put on it. There isn't much difference
between work and non-work for me. Rather, there is, but nonwork choices
directly impact my work choices.
You seem to offload a lot of your choices onto your company.
Just workin' for the man, eh?
Honestly, this is supposition, entirely unsupported by anything other
than my intuition about how companies I've worked for in the past behave. Feel free to ignore. I think they'll lap it up. Along with expensive and annoying licensing
terms, companies get no-forward emails and expiring spreadsheets. Think
about what Enron would have done with that. Hell, I suspect MS
probably evaluated what they did wrong in the antitrust trial in order
to avoid similar outcomes in the future. There's a market there.
Um. Who owns the market in "desktop productivity software"?
I use MS software for interoperability testing (much like I use
Quickbooks, some Oracle wares, etc.), and for client communication.
Everything else in my company is open source. Everything we deploy is
open source, unless the client asks for something else. They typically
pay for that choice, not only because I'm frequently not familiar with
the software they choose, but also because it's a bitch to work with
(anyone else ever have to deal with Adobe Distiller under unix?)
It isn't bullshit that to operate as a business entity, one needs MS
software. I can certainly dick around with my personal website and write
my memoirs without it, and 98% of what I do for a living is MS free,
getting business without it (read aloud as "public interfaces")
is nearly impossible. Perhaps you can ignore that, becuase you're just
working for the man, and it isn't your fault that you write MS Word
DRM is going to be another cost. I'll have to have a real MS box on
hand again, and the problem will be how it worms in to other parts of
the business, diverting me from my favored platform.
You can say you're not forced to use it. You're also not forced to
do anything but swear at other people in public.

I agree with you. Being anonymous is very important here.
Privacy is something alluded to by the famous "Gentlemen do not read
other gentlemen's mail".
Secrecy is what other people cannot find out.
Anonymity (strong or not) is vastly important to secrecy.
Medical data is a great example of this. It may be private, for some
(weak) values of private, right now. Being John Doe at the doctor's office and paying cash, though, is vastly better in terms of assurance, at least until the doctor's business-cam interfaces with other databases. Too bad that works so poorly with insurance, but then worker insurance in the US is nearly a government program,

There is ample evidence that you fail to argue about what people have _actually said_, impute motive and behaviour where there is none, and point to a grand Ellsworth Toohey-ish conspiracy that needs to be fought, improbably enough, by a nation-state.

Yep. Spam rates have been creeping up on Debian lists, lately.
