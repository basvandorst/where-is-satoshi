An artist asked the gallery owner if there had been any interest in his
paintings on display at that time.  "I have good news and bad news," the
owner replied.  "The good news is that a gentleman enquired about your work

girl in a children's pool in the backyard.  They splashed each other, got

grasshopper said, "I don't mind going, but my hopping will shake up the beer
and we'll get sprayed every time we open one."So they decided to send the
centipede; and the grasshopper explained how to get to the nearest liquor
store.An hour or so passed and still the centipede hadn't returned, so the
snail and the grasshopper decided to go look for him.They got as far as the
the front door and found the centipede sitting there putting on his
