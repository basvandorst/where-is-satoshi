Actually, I believe in most cases the only way "they" (DMCA) see the
data is that it _is_ published as a bittorrent file, meaning that others
can leach or download from that location as well as the originating
(or original) file itself.  In almost all cases that I have received these,
I can open my torrent, search for that file, and the IP address mentioned
shows up as a possible download (almost, not all)...
