@_subject: Safe country for crypto products 
Looks like, rather sooner than later, we will have to move some products to other countries. AnyDVD, which has slightly different enemies, moved from Switzerland to Antigua to Belize.
Looking at the slightly outdated cryptolaw.org, I wonder which non-EU/non-US country would actually be suitable to serve as host organization for open source crypto projects.
With some thinking, it probably can be arranged to have parallel entities in multiple countries 'responsible' for an open source project. I can't think of any examples where this is the case, most projects do have one primary legal home (trademark, copyright, etc).
