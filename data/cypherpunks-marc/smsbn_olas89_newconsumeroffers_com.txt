CHMS Achieves Record Sales In 2004
        This week SMSBreakingNews explores the SMS industry in China's business sector.  According to In-Stat, China is currently the world's fastest-growing telecom market. In fact, China is the world's # 1 cellular market, with 320 million users, already surpassing the U.S. subscriber base of less than 170 million, as reported by the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association. The Chinese SMS market alone accounts for 1/3rd of the world's traffic . SMS means sending and receiving brief text messages via mobile phones. SMS can be used for everything from promotional marketing to mobile banking.  One company SMSBreakingNews believes has remarkable potential is the U.S. corporation, China Mobility Solutions, Inc., publicly traded on the OTC BB Exchange under the symbol CHMS. With a rapidly growing client base of over 15,000 Chinese companies, including profit-sharing contracts with China's largest telecom companies, we predict CHMS is positioned to become China's leading SMS provider for commercial customers. CHMS is currently trading below US$1.00, which we believe makes it an undiscovered investment gem. We give CHMS our highest rating of 10 out of 10.
