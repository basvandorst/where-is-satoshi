Am presuming that some on that list are "multi-function" servers!?
Guess I'm thinking along the line of a PC that has a TOR relay and bridge (both) that's being logged by its ISP.
If all inbound and outbound TOR circuits were port 443, all the ISP would log is a bewildering collection of inbound, SSL-encrypted connections to 443, and  outbound, SSL-encrypted connections to 443 - hard to know if any given inbound is an entry-connection, or Likewise, outbound connections to 443 somewhere else might be TOR, or it might be the operator browsing his bank account.
If nothing else, defaulting to 443 would allow a greater number of "hotspot" laptops access to TOR from HTTP/S-only networks.

1. Given that the ISP will have logs anyway, why disallow German exit 2. How about changing all TOR port useage - including relays and entry ports - to 443?
'Twould be hard to know which are entry nodes, which are relays, and which is browser traffic. That ought to make "mapping" the onion, and ISP log analysis a little more challenging :-) .
