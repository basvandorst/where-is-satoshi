Hi cypherpunks,
I am one of the original authors of the May 12 press release
 "No Place to Hide:  Glenn
Greenwald, and the PayPal Billionaire"
Greenbacks' billionaire backer Pierre Omidyar makes the PayPal 14 pay
$86,000 for Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDOS), so we are
promoting Distributed Donations-of-Support (DDOS):
Without need of celebrities or go-betweens, you can donate directly to
the PayPal 14 at that page. If you can't chip in, please share that page
and ask people to go back to their roots by helping political
prisoners/hostages directly.
The first week the op raised $5,052.
The second week the op raised $2,298.
Tonight alone the op raised $180.
We had no SONY movie deal and didn't redact anything.
I am sure people who have difficulty unhitching their wagons from
celebrities and 'Thought Leaders' will say what a bad idea it is to
attack Redaction White Man who is telling multi-millionaire anchors
about the NSA to an audience who has already gotten the message the NSA
spies on every undefended gizmo. By the way, the US is not the world;
did you know Nigeria has 'NSA capability' from Israeli tech?

I've an odd question. Is there a program that will generate passwords
that imitate the badness with which humans armed with pen and paper only
would generate randomness? No, not a program that spits out "password"
over and over, that contemptible most frequently used password; I'm
imagining an English speaker of above average intelligence who has some
familiarity with best practices for coming up with passwords, but who's
no mathematical crypto wizard or anything.
Imagine a human who wants to generate an alphanumeric passphrase with
both upper- and lowercase, and he's in a jail cell with just pen and
paper. So he has a set of 62 characters to work with, and he tries to
write out a truly random password. But maybe he puts "M" in the password
too often for it to be truly random, because his name is Mario, so he
thinks about "M" unusually often; or maybe his writing surface is shaped
such that it incentivizes long downstrokes, so he pens the letter "l"
too often for true randomness.
Now, has anyone created a computer program to MIMIC what that human
would come up with? Is such a thing possible? Obviously I could simply
do it myself as a human being by, you know, qrMt8x3, but I want a
program that will create that for an x-long, say, 80,000 character-long,

Thankfully, everyone's familiar with approval economy (I support you, so

Retweeted those; think Maurizi did great with all that.
But I want to throw something out there as a devil's advocate. I've

denials can be revealing of additional information.
But what about the no-platform idea coming out of, e.g., Anti-Racist
Action in the U.S.? Where you simply deny your enemies the microphone to
speak out of at all. Why give them a platform?
A simple example other than these IC/MIC articles, because it's on my
mind - I was at a  protest yesterday. Tweeted that
there was a local MSM TV affiliate news van driving in toward the police
department, on the grounds that they got past the barricade whereas
presumably "civilian" vehicles wouldn't, and so that's supposedly
interesting. But is it? Hasn't everyone got that memo already? Who gives
a damn about the MSM any longer? Every platform/discussion given to them
is a platform not given to something potentially more valuable. I don't
think one could argue that "well you could just tweet additional stuff;
it's not either-or" because we all know there is a "tweetcost" of
annoying your audience or, more importantly, distracting them with
pointless information, in this case, about the relationship between
police and MSM.
I suppose that relationship is still pretty important to comment on, and
it's tactical information for activists to know which MSM trucks are
there...maybe I'm just irritated at the seeming pointlessness of this
all, the fetish that sheer information accomplishes infinite wonders in
the absense of analysis and action.

Perhaps the spam websites need to hide only text that is "real" in the
eyes of Google. And "Bell further alleged in his 2003" is "real" because
it is in a book. It could have been text out of any other book, but it
turned out to be you. Like winning the lottery, but in reverse. Perhaps
you could analyze strings of the other hidden text to see if they too
are from "real" sources.
I come up with this hypothesis because years back I used to write web
advertisements for an ambulance chaser law firm. They gave me the
original text, e.g., "If you or someone you care about has been injured
in an 18-wheeler accident in Atlanta, blah blah" and I had to write it
six hundred different ways, e.g. "If you or someone you love has been
hurt in a big rig crash in Atlanta, blah blah" Each version became its
own URL. The text of each had to be different, the law firm told me, or
Google would notice the similarities and penalize the websites for being
spam. It was a boring gig so I livened it up by writing in metric prose
- one sentence here in trochees, another sentence there in anapests, etc.
So "real" text is valuable.
That leads me to wonder, like a science fiction writer, how we could
take this to extremes. Which text is the most "real"? What might the
consequences be of variations in the degree of lorem ipsum texts' reality?

1. It's not my theory, but what do you make of the theory that WikiLeaks
would go under if it were not of the steady stream of celebrity
endorsements (Lady Gaga, Pamela Anderson, many more)? Is hugely
emphasized "soft power" a necessary component for a cabal out to change
the world? Or could, say, a cabal demonstrate more independence and
still be supported by enough people who do not need their hands held to
the conclusion by Lady Gaga?
2. How could/should an organization with more than two million followers
tweet in order to improve the world? Could it give the public specific,
actionable instructions for overthrowing governments and corporations?
They might have to be less specific, so as not to qualify as threats
that would get the account closed. But the account could massively
amplify the instructions to the public given by victims such as Doctors
Without Borders. Or it could organize boycotts of private spy firms such
as Stratfor. What do you think? People who care about branding might
argue that such tweets wouldn't fit WikiLeaks' brand, but things can be
easily framed as freedom of the press/speech or crytography--e.g.,
something like Israel's attacks on Gaza: you can't publish accounts of

Hacking Group may have bundled some sort of attack code that remotely

body five hundred years from now, the way to get one will be to have
someone grow one from a clone based on a copy of your DNA, not by trying

replicating your mind â and remember that you have somatic knowledge in

already have too many people, so why would any future society every put
any significant energy into bringing back the dead? How much energy will
the citizens of Year 3000 care to put into producing a brand new Ted

My understanding is that like all gall, Social Security payments are
divided into three parts: SSI, SSDI, and retirement benefits. Sometimes
people think of SSDI as retirement benefits for those forced, pressured,
or opting to retire early by disability qualification/identification,
and SSI is available to many more but the payments are low, not enough
to live on autonomously without participation in covert economies or
gray market economies.
As many probably know, under US taxes freelancers today pay into
retirement benefits, which are only available to recoup if you've served
the overt economy enough for 40 "work credits". These same 40 come up if
a freelancer asks for a social security statement for purposes of, e.g.,
estimating SSDI payments. Some individuals qualified as disabled get
both SSDI and SSI, some only get one or the other. Today.
I don't know exactly what this was like in Rand's day, nor how she got
paid royalties or advances for Fountainhead, the Gary Cooper movie based
on it, etc. Seems like she liked money enough to live in NYC for much of
her life. But, Rand's husband wanted to paint and drank himself to
death, is the prevailing story out of the Nathaniel Branden Institute
faction etc. So there's that. I assume the Ayn Rand Institute guards
Rand's business contracts etc. That funny story about Peikoff trying to
get back the Fountainhead manuscript pages he donated to the gubment
because of his choice of words, "stealing" some of the pages etc.
This is difficult for me to parse, sounds like misogyny, except I assume
there's some sarcasm/irony embedded that may make sense to you if not

Hello cryptocurrency hoarders, aspiring cryptocurrency hoarders, and others,
In English the system for accenting English words is binary. If one were
to say aloud, "crypto", each syllable is either stressed or unstressed,
yes no, on off, CRYPT-o. 1, 0.
Similarly, Morse code is binary. Dash or dot. CRYPTO in Morse code is:
-.-. .-. -.-- .--. - --- or, assuming arbitrarily that dash is 1: 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1.
This, I don't know the fancypants word, homomorphism, across the two
systems -- that both are suspectible to binary rendition -- means that in
theory one could say X and non X simultaneously with one string.
I guess the most obvious difficult is that the Morse stuff takes up way
many more characters than the verbal scansion. For example, cat (as in
feline, not concatenate) is just a single syllable stressed. So it's a
single character: 1.But in Morse code, "cat" is -.-. .- - which takes 7
characters not counting spaces.
One thing I like about this system is that the attacker Chuck could know
exactly what the algorithm is and neveretheless fail to decrypt it becasue
the whole system is so ridiculous that only an Alice and Bob with a lot of
time on their hands and/or eccentricity would be able to actually bother
to encipher and decrpt these kind of strings.
Is there a way to make this work without using Morse (becasue too many
characters) but while keeping the defense of eccentricity, i.e., the
time/weird investment required in order to encipher and decrypt?

I hate Ayn Rand but this frequently cited fact -- that she took social
security payments -- is often cited to allegedly prove her hypocrisy. But
her argument was, the government stole from her, so she was justified in
recouping some of the stolen money by filling out the paperwork etc. Her
logic makes sense to me given her ideas so I don't think it was
hypocritical, even if wrong.
Also more broadly, should outgroups steal from one another?  The best
argument I see in favor is they are dangerous outgroups, so harm them to
protect you and yours. The best argument I see against is the more one
interacts with someone (even to inflict damage), the more one (if one is
goodhearted? prosocial?) starts to empathize with that individual and
wants to help them recondition rather than continue to harm. Thoughts?
To tie it into cypherpunks just use as examples warring factions/tribes in

Hey cypherpunks / nerdcoin hoarders,
Tangent, but there's a somewhat similar question in philosophy of mind.
People sometimes imagine human consciousness to be a kind of
"theater"[1]: all the sensory input is arriving from behind the curtain
(optic nerves etc. transmitting inbound info), then that traveling
sensory input crosses some sort of finish line, and then is presented,
entirely bundled up together (audio, video, etc.), on some some of inner
theater, to some inner self, who then makes a rational decision about
the display on the theater, and consequently sends output ("strike
keyboard with finger") to the body, etc., until new sensory input
arrives on the internal movie screen, triggering more decisions from the
inner self/captain of the ship/homonculus...
An interesting complication to the above is, like the different colors
of light going through the prism at minutely different speeds, thereby
introducing confusing complexity to a model generally taken as
straightforward, well, the sensory input traveling through the body, the
brain neurons, etc., do not always perform properly, do not all operate
at the same speed, etc. So there's lag among these different inbound,
command, and outbound signals, and perhaps the theater is dishonestly
representing the various confusing input as straightforwardly bound
together. Maybe one optic nerve is slightly longer than the other due to
some congenital reason. So on and so forth.
I'm not sure what the implications of the above would be for, e.g.,
neuro-surgeons performing operations, athletes trying to master their
mind-bodies, Libet and free will[2], etc. Sometimes I think the above is
just well-off people with copious spare time flapping their jaws --
elementary school lunch table shit ("How do I know you see green when I
see green?") just with bigger words and longer sentences, while everyone
else suffers, does the jaw-flappers' unpaid domestic labor, disappears
into ICE prisons, etc., their views and insights on the above never
recorded to history.

@_subject: Burner phone for international call from US 
Dear cryptocurrency hoarders, aspiring cryptocurrency hoarders, and
those discarded by -- or barely hanging on in -- a global (anti)society
dedicated to assigning high status to those most adept at hoarding
commodities, while exterminating those odd enough to, like, help others:
In Seattle where I reside, I'd like to purchase a burner phone for less
than $100 USD, though upper limit price is negotiable. Preferably
purchase offline with cash.
This phone will be used by a comrade, whom I will coach, to place an
international call to a Western country, and a few calls within the
United States.
I do not want the recipients of the calls to associate them with me, my
name, my voice, my phone number, etc. The recipients of the calls are
low-level staffpeople at small/medium-sized enterprises and/or
educational institutions.
I do not care what super-duper state-level, corporate-level adversaries
know about me and my comrade and the calls. So although juking the NSA
and doing James Bond backflips is key to cryptofarters' masturbatory
fantasies, please hew to the standard spiels about threat models, etc.
Just trying to trick, er undercover interview, some low level
staffpeople at small/medium firms and educational institutions. Not God.
A key point is, it would be good if I could install onto the device one
of those obscure Russian or otherwise seedy apps that record all the
phone calls, so I may transcribe the phone calls later. If that's not an
option, then the device needs a loud speakerphone so I can point a small
digital audio recorder at it and record the calls for later transcription.
The purpose is journalistic research which, sorry not sorry Russophile
Zennadsfnsdjg Harkargfdsjkghsdkjg, I will not describe, even though last
time I asked something research-y you tried to pry the purpose out of
me, probably so you could use it a springboard to scream pro-Putin crap.
Some folks in Seattle suggested I obtain, from another person, one of
the government-funded smartphones that are sometimes handed out by
social services here. I've used these devices before, so many millions
of adverts clog the screens, they're a nightmare. Also they would betray
the area code, which probably isn't a problem but it would be ideal to
have at least a non-Seattle area code, maybe an area code in some other
Washington state area? Also I'm not sure if they can make international
calls, being government funded. Does anyone know? Also I'm not sure it's
possible to install one of the seedy call-recording apps on one of these
gov devices.
I'll be out of state in a few days, travelling in the US Pacific
Northwest for a few days, so if there's a model y'all would suggest I
buy at an out-of-state 7-Eleven or something, please let me know.
If you don't know, maybe you could suggest a subreddit where it would be
more helpful to ask, or an up-to-date guide or FAQ about this sort of thing.
Thanks! May all your cryptocurrency fantasies come true --

at Assange's face endlessly, we instead do things that are pro social.

Soo much complete bullshit from Zenaan as usual. See below for those

Off the top of my head:
People have been around for hundreds of thousands of years and have

world is of much bigger scope than Zenaan permits; humans have much more
range than benzo addict Jordan Peterson yelling about lobsters and
hoping to hoard even more commodities/bananas.

We have recently learned from benzo addict Jordan Peterson that he is an
Here, think of this. Trade versus sharing. Obviously, especially older
generations, will automatically hear "sharing" and think "Soviet Union"
or "communism" but there are other real-life models for actual sharing.
Imagine you are on a road trip with three friends. Four individuals in
the vehicle. You all have a single bag of 100 kale chips.
Communism is when one of these four becomes a dictator and says "each
person gets exactly 25 kale chips because we're all [supposedly] equal,
(though perhaps a few extra kale chips for me)" and anyone who disagrees
is killed, etc. USian anarchists insisting on rebranding history to fuel
their attempts at celebrity cstatus all this "State communism" because
then they can agree with their constitutencies of rank-and-file idiots
that "communism is a good thing", but most people know better about the
failures of communism, etc.
Trade (such as capitalism, yes not just crony capitalism, jim bell), is
when you gesture to your ingroup friend in the car that you'd like to
have some kale chips too and he says "$5 or GTFO." Suddenly you are an
outgroup on this roadtrip. You don't belong anymore; you've been
shunned. You have to provide dolla dolla bill up front to your former
friends because you can no longer sit with them etc.
Trade is when you go to the deli and say "Fuck you, I paid the five
dollars, give me my goddamn reuben" and you get your sandwich without
having to ponder, associate with, or help the dead factory farm animals,
the workers cleaning the deli, the homeless person who hangs out in the
deli, etc. It's just fuck you I paid give me my sandwich. Trade =
outgrouping; sharing = ingrouping.
Forget the communism crap, I had to clarify since "sharing"
automatically triggers "communism" in people's impressionable brains,
you know this world where we all go around murmuring "invisible hand" or
"proletariat" because dead guys wrote those words down hundreds of years
ago. So just normal sharing. Like little kids usually do. Sharing is
what ingroups do. It's fluid custodianship of assets.
In this roadtrip case, the assets are the 100 kale chips to be
distributed/allocated during the course of the road trip. The road
trippers share the kale chips according to respect, approval, logic,
etc, because they are in-group folks. Maybe the driver needs a few extra
because the driver is tired from focusing on the road. Maybe the one
passenger with high blood pressure needs to not have so many salty
chips, so the other 3 subtly and semi-automatically look out for this
person, making sure this person doesn't have too many kale chips. This
is all sort of natural and automatic and the situation is dynamically
refreshed constantly. Maybe the car breaks down so everyone becomes more
careful to save the kale chips. This sort of sharing is what ingroups
do, not just road trips but also families, officeworkers in an office
setting familiar to them, etc. We're all familiar with this. Imagine you
are working in a computer firm office and suddenly one secretary demands
the other secretary fork over $2 for the good pencil with the eraser
left on it. No, obviously, these employees see each other as ingroup so
they share the good pencil on an as-needed basis and refresh the
situation according to life's contingencies. Maybe someone gets shunned
or the dynamically refreshed situation changes, everyone decides to burn
down their employer, leak all the documents, strike, or whatever.
Trade is what outgroups do. I don't trust you, so I'm not gonna do X for
you unless you do Y for me. And those most skilled at trading rise to
the top of this, as lobster fanatic and benzo addict Jordan Peterson
screams, but did you know for hundreds of thousands of years not all of
life is based on trade? Over time in ideal circumstances trade might
lead to the traders becoming ingroup with each other, ending the trade,
and starting up sharing / fluid custodianship of assets. But in today's
world the deli never changes because of overwhelming social control
exerted by corporations, states, etc. You have to trade for the reuben,
even though the deli worker behind the counter has come to know you from
your regular stops and y'all share good tidings with each other,
friendly comments on the rainy weather, etc. The sharing prosocial world
and the trade antisocial world exist side by side every time you stop at
the deli counter, two vibes or spheres uncomfortably overlapping.
Trade means non-traders, such as very disabled individuals or infants or
elderly, are forced to rely on shameful charity rather than being
treated as integral parts of the ingroup. Today in the capitalist ideal,
everyone is their own 'sole proprietor' of an outgroup of everyone else,
7.5 billion outgroups all competing, except for say families, or when
people start forming ingroups, as they do in so many situations. You can
tell trade is stupid for ingroups because it doesn't include
automatically infants and elderly etc. Able-bodied white people with no
kids please! Yeah, let's base all the rules on 30 year olds and just
kick infants and elderly to the curb with shameful charity. Makes a lot
of fucking sense as a lifelong, generations-long strategy /sarcasm.
"Where there's justice, there's no need for charity." -- Wollstonecraft
We need a global commons for public data so we can organize effectively
to knowledgeably replace the social structures, not just cheering on
corporate Twitter etc when the current ones continue to collapse (and
then when our number's up screaming that we deserve more cryptocoin to
float our own particular outgroup boat), and so there can be a literate
population that can maintain individual autonomy (which means so much
more than trade but also cooking skill, traveling skill, etc etc)
through individual rights but also be informed in agreeing to social
contracts etc because we're simultaneously very social creatures.

Hey cypherpunks,
I have never really used a tablet before. When I say "tablet" I, like
many, picture in my head an iPad.
I would like to order a tablet or two online. My six criteria are:
1) Hackable. So that I could put some generic Linux thing on it, the way
an everyday smart user, who is not employed by the Free Software
Foundation, puts Ubuntu on their laptop or Cyanogenmod/LineageOS on
their smartphone. Without spending my life trying to get it to work, but
some struggle is okay, around the struggle required to get
Cyanogenmod/LineageOS working on a typical USian smartphone, etc
2) Durable/rugged.
3) Fairly convenient. Maybe a few more ports than usual, a few more
options than usual, maybe some extra power sources or something like
4) Certified refurb would be nice
5) Price range around idk $250-$300 or something per tablet. Amazon.com
says "New Apple iPad (10.2-Inch, Wi-Fi, 32GB) - Space Gray (Latest
Model)" costs around $280:
But of course surge pricing and out-of-stock is happening everywhere
because it's corona time. So maybe something in stock would be great,
older or whatever
6) External keyboard accessory would be nice and perhaps mandatory, link
to this also p|0x?
Planned use:
1) Hook it up to SDR to scan the local security forces -- cops, fire,
etc -- leave it set up in home that way doing that
2) Backup / travel / bug out bag
If more than one, perhaps identical/similar in different colors for ease
of telling them apart quickly or sharing them with other human beings
If anyone can offer some recommendations, I will say something mean

like a virtual panel with audience attendees etc?

Hi cypherpunks,
For reference, some things I discovered researching this today for
several hours, this is more for an enduser perspective than either a
genuine expert perspective or the perspective of a Boomer incel fantasy
about being James Bond / Tony Stark while doing backflips and
fantasizing about going gay for Juliassar al-Assadnge or whatever.
*   Signal: won't work for video chat of more than two people, because
according to various mainstream sources accessed 22 April 2020, Signal
video chat is only 1 to 1
*   Wire: won't work for video chat of more than 4 people, because
according to official website accessed 22 April 2020, video conferencing
is available for up to only 4 participants, and audio conferencing is
available for up to only 10 participants.
*   Jitsi (i.e. Jitsi Meet): won't work for video chat for 10-20+
people, because according to an April 2020 Association for Computing
Machinery report, "does not scale well and can be unreliable" and "in
the default configuration, video is not mixed; instead every participant
gets all the audio and video streams. This may not scale well." Further,
see what Greg Newby said previously on this email list.
*   TwoSeven: I have no experience with  but it may
be of some relevance. It's a website and Chrome extension that has a
free version and pay versions/packages between $3 and $20 a month. It
allows chat, video, and audio, and is geared toward helping people
remote from one another watch simultaneously the following depending on
version/package: youtube, netflix, amazon, HBO, vimeo, and video files
users upload.
*   Kast: I have no experience with Kast, but it may be of some
relevance. It's either  or  (not sure
which), formerly  is a free or premium ($5/mo)
application for browser, mobile, or desktop that allows audio-video chat
and text chat during watch parties for youtube clips, users playing
computer games, etc.
*    Kast and TwoSeven have a lot of competitors. See for example, 16
Sites Like Rabb.it -  -
but from this tech guide for sex workers -
 -
it seems Kast and TwoSeven are the frontrunners in their respective
areas. Kast reminds me a bit of  which was the big
solution for online video parties around Occupy/Anon/leak platform days
and is still running. Haha, some people have nothing else, can't move
on, and think it is still 2010, but thankfully for the rest of us life
continues and is amazing!
*	For one-to-one encrypted video chat, choices are Signal, Wire, or
Jitsi. Signal has an annoying social graphing problem that is
particularly problematic for vulnerable or marginalized individuals,
where installing Signal suddenly alerts your contacts that you have
Signal, see
Wire is based in Switzerland, Berlin, and EU. Jitsi comes from, as far
as I could make out during a few hours' research today, a DIY hackerish
background but was recently acquired by a Silicon Valley-based, publicly
traded VoIP company, 8x8 Inc. So if for one to one video you pick
between either Wire or Jitsi, that means picking between -- and this is
an educated guess and half joking -- the fancy solution presumably used
by money launderers corporations and pedo rings (Wire) or the slightly
Millenium Falcon-y Jitsi that will probably be great for another 1-3
years until 8x8 Inc. decides to sell and/or ruin their new toy.

Hey cypherpunks,
So what video chat options are there that are less privacy violating and
social graphing than Zoom, Skype, etc, while still being at least
somewhat available to the everyday user? Imagine two use cases:
1. Audiovideo chat between Alice and Bob: they want to watch an online
movie together whether by sharing a screen or some other method, and
then have sexy times later by same audiovideo chat. Imagine further that
Bob uses Linux laptop and knows more or less what he's doing, while
Alice uses Windows or Apple or her standard-issue smartphone or w/e and
doesn't want to spend her little weekend time off paidwork trying to
configure stuff to meet some faraway incel's expectation of flawless
fantasy security.
2. A video panel or Q&A being hosted by your local friendly anarchist
bookstore. Maybe it needs 3-5 people on a panel talking, their famous
faces visible on the screen along with their audio while they debate
each on internecine leftist conflicts that distract from far more
rational propaganda of the deed, while the 20 people in the audience,
including people of all sorts of demographics who have a hard enough
time paying their bills online, have their audio and video forcibly off
so there's not random beeps and bloops and toddler singing during the
panel, but the audience could still type in Q&A questions or whatever.
It would also be cool if there was a film screening option -- imagine an
anarchist bookstore that prior to covid19 had been doing weekly film
screenings offline in their brick and mortar location, but now wants to
do something similar online, while making it hopefully accessible for
people without intense computer skills.
How are Signal and Wire for the above?
My big picture understanding has for a long time been that, 1. perfect
security is snake oil, the top spy agencies can crack anything if they
want given enough time and targetting interest, but that's not typically
relevant to the above use cases unless you're a Supreme Court justice or
an incel fantasizing about being James Bond, 2. encryption makes data
packet size much bigger, and large data size is already a problem with
video in cleartext, so there never has been a really good solution to
this problem. However  was my understanding as of like 5 years ago, so
I'm curious if some new solution has come out.
It looks like EFF is fairly useless and using Zoom themselves. I suppose
if they're not gonna go after something meaningful, like how the
corporate voting gear in the US is closed source, they have to spend
that sweet Papa Omidyar cash and prestige somehow and produce little
guides about how to toggle your Zoom settings. Afte
Guides by Riseup Networks don't have much on video understandably
Prism Break mentions something called Jami I've never heard of
And yeah, Signal and Wire...? I know everything is fucked but using
something less bad for the use cases outlined above seems better than
diving headfirst into whatever the worst popular solutions are.

Hi cypherpunks,
I sent out a bunch of queries today to news outlets, namely Slate,
Salon, Vice, The Atlantic, Gizmodo, Ars Technica, Wired US, Wired UK,
and Al Jazeera. To give you the general idea of the article I aim to
publish, the subject line is "Freelance pitch: Open science helps
Seattle activists overcome pandemic, Twitter exec order" and the open
science systems are Sci-Hub and GetGee, and the Seattle activists are
rentstrike, anarchist soup kitchen, etc.
Can the list please recommend for pitching any non-United States
tech/news outlets publishing in English that have medium to large
audiences? I will check dw.com and other Germany in a few.
The goal is to lodge an article into one of these venues to promote
Sci-Hub and GetGee by explaining to the public how public data systems
would help with coronavirus, with practical relatable examples like
rentstrike, Food Not Bombs, etc.
P.S. Yes, I know corporate media is bad, good job Chomsky, tell me

P.P.S. Yes, I know you think I should use more encryption, good job
incel boomer, have you considered the downsides of broadcasting for wide

Excerpt below of self governance goals from the COVID-19 catalyst
effect, an April 2020 post by Heather Marsh:
It is futile to weed without planting; now is our window to plant the
seeds of a better world. Here are a few of the opportunities we are
being given in various parts of the world and which we can try to
establish and defend in all parts.
The fact that pollution increases COVID-19 deaths has been used to limit
vehicle traffic and reclaim city streets for physical distancing of
bikes and pedestrians. Vehicle traffic has always increased deaths from
pollution, not to mention the astronomical amount of deaths caused by
vehicle accidents; reclaim all city streets and never give them back.
Pollution is so unhealthy every day that the COVID-19 shutdowns of
industry have, in some regions, potentially saved more lives than were
lost to the pandemic. Pollution needs to continue to be recognized and
treated as a global health emergency on par with the pandemic.
Public transit is free in some places to reduce contact with bus
drivers. Donât ever let it be unfree again. Providing free streets for
vehicles and charging for public transit is taxing the necessities of
the poor for the autogenocidal luxuries of the wealthy.
Food banks are receiving more government funding in places; food stores
ought to be free, filled with healthy, locally produced food. Think of
the carbon footprint reduction, medical care reduction, and general
increase in happiness and competence that would be caused by universal
access to fresh, healthy food and universal ability to grow and share
food locally, perhaps in the laneways and parking lots freed from
vehicle traffic. Why should every child have a right to education but
not food? How is free health care effective if healthy food, air and
water are unattainable?
Evictions have been stopped in some places and those without homes are
suddenly being housed to prevent COVID-19 deaths. Poverty and lack of
housing has always been lethal; eradicate poverty and universalize
access to homes.
Some people have acknowledged that releasing the majority of prisoners
will create no social ill and prisons are inhumane. Some are even
acknowledging the extreme mental distress and increased tendency to
violence caused by social isolation. Use this opportunity to re-examine
the goals and methods of archaic and cruel prison punishments and
construct rehabilitative alternatives which focus on harm prevention.
The Canadian government and others have rejected IP protection for
necessary COVID-19 treatment and supplies; abolish IP while crediting
creators and we will see an explosion in creativity and scientific
advancement. COVID-19 is hardly the only emergency facing the world.
The vital need for knowledge emanating from transparent, two-way,
epistemic communities and facilitated by knowledge bridges is finally
being recognized. Ignorance is lethal. Knowledge needs to be a human
right. Establish protection and support for this right in all areas of
social collaboration, including corporate and governance activity.
Health is, at least for a moment, being prioritized over industry. This
is a sign of the weakening of industrial endo-idealism. This must be
recognized as the moment of sublation it is; do not allow this moment of
victory over industrial endo-idealism to blind us to its potential
replacement by a transcendental mono-empire. Be aware of these attempts,
such as Google and Apple surveillance justified by the pandemic, and
instead, seize the moment to establish exosocial collaboration.
Transparent, collaborative knowledge with two-way epistemic communities
are providing the information on health guidelines. All science needs to
be open and collaborative and unfiltered through political and corporate
interests. Cancer and many other diseases could also be greatly reduced
with the same transparency and prioritizing of health over industry.
We are seeing an example of governance by epistemic communities,
Knowledge regarding the pandemic is global and transparent. Policy
implementation is under networked regional authority which consults and
defers to regional experts informed by that global knowledge. This is
the new method of collaborative governance that I described a decade ago
and wrote in Binding Chaos. For this method to work, knowledge (not
simply speech or information) must be a human right.
Tourism has all but halted. Some states, such as the US, and China, will
attempt to use this to entrench totalitarianism and greatly restrict
ability to move. Letâs instead try to create a new habit of slow travel;
letâs forfeit the social media selfies and work on creating true links
of friendship, mutual aid, trust and discovery when we are guests in
other peopleâs communities and homes.
Worry about supply chains is suddenly causing questioning of
international forced dependency on trade. This is a window to encourage
collaboration through networked development of strength and support, not
hierarchical development of enforced dependency.
Airbnb and others have taken a huge economic hit. This could be an
opportunity to develop Getgee and networked control of our own service
industries, instead of apps controlled in Silicon Valley.
These and many other opportunities for great social change are being
presented where just a few months ago the same ideas were dismissed as
utopian and unrealistic.

"Principles of a society contained in documents such as constitutions
and bills of rights can be listed with the historic or potential
consequences of each definition and option. This clarification makes
each point far easier for every member of society to understand and
agree on and then ensure that all law in that society flows naturally
from the root principles. It could also be possible to use accepted
principles to choose association, for instance to refuse trade with a
corporation that refuses to accept certain environmental practices."
