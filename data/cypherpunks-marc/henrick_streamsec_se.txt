Sorry, you lost me. Are you implying that everyone here except me is a US citizen, and that the purpose of this group is to promote the national interest of the USA?

I do not think it is /relevant/ to call this discussion a "witch hunt" (true or not).
Kevin Igoe is not on trial. The question should in my honest opinion be that of a plain cost-benefit analysis, and not that of his guilt or - Has Kevin Igoe done a good job?
- Are there any better candidates for the position?
- Is this a completely exceptional case, or would replacing him as co-chair set an example that might hurt the reputation of the organization or its future processes in any way?
