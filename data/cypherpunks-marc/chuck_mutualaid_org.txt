I'm failing to understand what it so new about "specifismo." I've been arguing for a strategy like this for many years, as have many anarchists. It sounds like something related to "practical anarchism" and "ecumenical anarchism" which have been focuses of my work for many years. I think the anarchist emphasis on practical daily struggles, creating counter institutions, and long term resistance to the state and capitalism, is what sets anarchism apart from vanguardist socialism.
If Albert and other leftists are finally accepting anarchist ideas and methodology, that sounds good to me.
