Tahoe-lafs can be fast. A grid I help out with is often capable of
600kilobyte/per/second downloads (or faster), and I personally have
several files stored on there in excess of 500mb. Close enough to your
700mb movie example. I use this storage as a CDN of sorts, as a friend wrote an HTTP
interface to the Tahoe-lafs grid. Should you wish to see it in action, the code and download links are
over here -->
