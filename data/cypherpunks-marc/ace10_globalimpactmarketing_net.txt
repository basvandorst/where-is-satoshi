Capital Group, Inc. (AMEX; RCG)
BUY Target Price: $2.07
BUY recommendation; lowering 12-month price target
RCG has continued to make progress both in revenue growth and in
cash flow improvement
despite the rather bleak current economic conditions and the
aftermath of the Events of
September. We feel this has been possible due to an increased
focus on cost controls, cash flows and senior managements involvement in dynamically running the
company.
