Not sure if there is a legal precedent for this, but logically the
difference is that there are no robots that I know of that can =
receive and parse postal mail, then re-address and forward it.  For a =
to forward a letter takes a conscious manual action, even if they choose =
to look inside.
Having a Tor node for no specific purpose, having a hacked server/pc =
that is
then compromised for some nefarious purpose, etc. are not necessarily
purposeful actions that one could be held accountable for without other
proof.  I'd think the LEA would have to establish motive, like in any =
crime, to make that jump.  Perhaps in this case they believe they have, =
that would end up in the courts, where you'd have to hope the Judge and =
Jury sees that difference.
Don't see this as very different either from when an agency confiscates =
whole rack of shared servers because one user was suspected of some bad
action, and we all know that does happen.

you can.
"Mere conduit" defense.  (Please do not anyone mention "common carrier
status" or the like, ISPs are _not_ common carriers.)
How do you "shut off" a Tor "account"?
Do you think if the police found out child pr0n was being served from a
starbux they wouldn't confiscate the equipment from that store?
