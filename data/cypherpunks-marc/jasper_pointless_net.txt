Tangentially to this: any chance of supporting TLSA/DANE records for _110._tcp.domain and _995._tcp.domain? (and the IMAP equivalents).
That would let people carry on using self signed certs who prefer to and let people who have a cert that chains back to a root CA assert which root CA the cert should chain back to, which would be nice in these days of diginotar and comodo hacks...
