Dear valued visitor of our download area
You can download the requested file from the following link:
 The file contains the basic IDEA reference code in C/C++ "as is" without detailed documentation. No technical support is available.
For professional implementation using object oriented programming we offer Software Development Kits (SDKs) for C/C++ and Java(tm) as part of the IDEA License Packs.
The SDKs offer you a set of well-proven and tested crypto tools for faster and optimized implementation of IDEA into security products. They come with full documentation, including test suites, and technical support, allowing the implementation of IDEA without extensive knowledge in cryptography.
Further details on the SDKs are available at: Best regards
The MediaCrypt Team
