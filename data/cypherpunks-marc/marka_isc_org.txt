In message I suspect most file sharing site don't have illegal content.  Most
would have some content that is there without the permission of the
copyright holder.  These are different things.
This case is not that there is copyrighted content there without
the permission of the copyright holder.  It's that they, allegedly,
failed to remove such content when explictly notified of it which
put them outside the safe harbour provision of DMCA.

No.  The correct metaphor is I have a key and a bunch of locks keyed to that
lock.  I give them a lock to install which only the key I have can open.
Actually it is a big win.  You now have to compromise millions of machines
to get millions of keys rather than a couple of machines to get millions
of passwords.
That is a real issue.

I suspect you would fine that such a ring would illegal as it is a
potential "man trap".   There are reasons hospitals have big warning
signs around similar equipment used for medical imaging.
