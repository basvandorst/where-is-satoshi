A slight clarification: the definition of a hierarchical graph is somewhat subjective,
once one extends the notion beyond a rooted tree hierarchy. Usually, one can find
a small collection of source nodes from which all paths flow, ignoring some small collection
of back edges. In some contexts, the graph here is a fine hierarchy, if very wide and shallow,
and the drawing produced by dot is the desired one, exhibiting a bipartite graph.
The Graphviz home page does have a high-level description of the types of layouts one can
expect from the various algorithms. There is a fun page put together by John Ellson for WebDot
   where one can compare the output produced by the various algorithms on a given example graph.
