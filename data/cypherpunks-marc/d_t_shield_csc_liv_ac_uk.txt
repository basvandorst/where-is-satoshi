OK - very briefly:
SNMPv1 was the original protocol, with a relatively simple administrative
framework (single community string), and set of protocol operations
(Get/GetNext/Set + Trap)
SNMPv2c kept the same administrative framework, and improved the protocol
operations (added GetBulk, new form of Trap/Inform, better exception and
error reporting).
SNMPv3 kept the same protocol operations as SNMPv2c, and improved the
administrative framework (authentication & encryption, contexts, etc).
See  for a fuller explanation,
or the RFCs for the definitive low-down.
You may find  has some other useful stuff too...

The snmptranslate command takes the name of a MIB *object*
(not a file) and returns the OID for that object.
That's quite correct.
There is no such object as 'UCD-DEMO-MIB'
Try something like
    snmptranslate UCD-DEMO-MIB::ucdDemoMIBObjects
