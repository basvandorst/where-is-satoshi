successfully *mail* enough drugs for the NSA/DEA to care.
All estimates point to tens of millions of dollars in business per year. Do
you think the estimates are off or that that's still too low?

No, the Government Never Asked Linus Torvalds for a Backdoor in Linux
"Oh, Christ. It was obviously a joke, no government agency has ever asked
me for a backdoor in Linux," Torvalds told *Mashable* via email. "Really.
Cross my heart and hope to die, really."

If DPR has really been known since March 2011, that'd be pretty incredible.

I saw TMP going away,  very interesting. However, I think the absence of a
seizure notice says it all. The owner, like others, probably decided to
quit while he was ahead and out of cuffs. What is funny is that no bitcoins
will likely be lost because TMP uses multi sig, so the feds can't take
anything without other the buyer and seller agreeing.
That's not to say that I have a definitive answer but that was my read on
the situation.
