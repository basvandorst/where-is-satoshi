 that's speech. In fact, there are any number of criminal acts that can be=

 being suppressed. For example, when I hire a hitman, it's not the=
 speech that's the issue but the offer of contract. This argument is somewhat=
 persuasive in the 'hire a hitman' case, but I don't find it so in the 'death=
 threat' case.
=09If I state, "I presently intent to kill Jack Smith if he doesn't=
 mail me $500 in cash", what is there in that other than the content of=
 the idea I wish to express? Freedom of speech is not some contextless=
 absolute. It's a very important principle among other primary principles.

means the right to express those ideas you wish using that which is yours to
use. It does not include the right to commandeer other people's presses.
use without discrimination from the government based upon the content of
your speech. Private citizens, on the other hand, need not listen if they
don't want to -- that's part of freedom of expression too.
The discrimination is not based upon content -- I would have on complaint if
they published the intrustion in the New York Times rather than using it
against *my* computers. Your freedom of speech ends it my ears.
