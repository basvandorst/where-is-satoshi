She probably upgraded from jessie, in which case the php5 that she had
in jessie remained in place after the upgrade to stretch.
As Ulf says, a *new* install of stretch will not be able to install
php5 unless you add a jessie source.

It's hardly unique.  You could do the same thing with a shell script
wrapper that calls ulimit and then exec's the target program.
rsync uses a shitload of memory not because it's copying a file with
an enormous buffer size, but because it's tracking *all* of the file
metadata in the entire hierarchy that you feed to it.
Well, prematurely killing rsync is not going to affect the kernel's
retention or discarding of specific disk cache pages that are more
precious to you.

I haven't been following this thread because I don't know anything
about the kernel's "swappiness" settings.
But I'm a little bit confused about the intent here -- setting a
resource limit on memory is just going to make the program crash
with an "out of memory" error when it tries to exceed the limit.
It's not going to discipline a memory hog program into using
different algorithms.
