        Why France lived in fear of 'Londonistan'
        By Sean O'Neill
        Terrorist recruitment and fundraising by Islamic militants centred
on a London mosque were ignored for years by the British security services,
a former Special Branch informant claimed yesterday.
Naturally, the British security services will be using the current
climate of terror to cry out for even more intrusive powers to
spy on goDog&EveryBody, in order to gather an even larger
database of information to ignore until it is too late...
