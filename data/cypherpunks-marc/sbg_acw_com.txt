Is it possible that the amount of information that the knowledge of a
sub-threshold number of Shamir fragments leaks in finite precision setting
depends on the finite precision implementation?
For example, if you know 2 of a 3 of 5 splitting and you also know that
the finite precision setting in which the fragments will be used is IEEE
32-bit floating point or GNU bignum can you narrow down the search for the
key relative to knowing no fragments and nothing about the finite
precision implementation?

With regards to alternative "runtime" decryptions, recall ...
The claim is that the approach is neither encryption nor steganography.
