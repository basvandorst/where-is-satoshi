Job-hunting takes no holiday
Abridged: Democratandchronicle.com
ROCHESTER, NY -- An unemployed person's job hunt doesn't have to go barren over the holidays. In many ways, with good cheer in the air, now is the best time to look. "A lot of people during the holidays think that the job search is not on anybody's lists or minds and will take time off," said Karin Edinger, senior career coach/counselor for Rochester's Career Development Services. "But that's where they're off the mark." Businesses, as they finish 2005 budgets, might need more workers for the new year making holiday events prime for networking. Continuing your job hunt during this period might also stave off depression - which could set in because you are strapped for cash
during a big gift-giving season. "You should never, never, never let up," said Judie Myers-Gell, a human resource professional who lost her job several months. "It's a hidden job market that tends to be overlooked over the holidays." Myers-Gell, for example, just had an interview in which the company told her that the job wouldn't start until February. "Some companies are now doing their budgets and foreseeing certain openings," she said.

Staff Writer, The Career Digest

The new year's resolutions trap
Pat Schuler, Business Development Coach
MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- You've seen the statistics year after year - less than 10 percent of New Year's resolutions are honored 30 days later. Most last less than 10 days. Why do we make resolutions each year? To please others? To prove we're serious? Because we should? Because it's easier than really investing in ourselves?What if there were a tool that helped us determine which resolutions and goals were really important to us, and not just lip service? What if there was a model that helped us focus and stay on track? Can you pledge meeting times and status reports to a buddy? Absolutely. Could you get to your goal even faster with the support of a skilled professional?Now,
more than ever before, there is a huge array of experts available to us. They are easy to find via referrals and through the web. They come in a wide selection of price points. This year, get serious and set a budget for that goal or resolution, and hire the professional support you need and deserve.
Unemployment claims: Biggest drop in 3 years
Abridged: ChicagoTribune.com
WASHINGTON, DC -- The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of Americans filing initial jobless claims fell by 43,000 last week, the largest one-week decline in three years. First-time claims dropped to 317,000, the lowest level since the week ended July 3. Economists had expected a fall to 342,000. The four-week moving average, which irons out weekly volatility, decreased to 337,750 from 342,250."Seasonal adjustment problems over the Thanksgiving holiday account for the volatility in recent weeks, and there will be further big swings over the next few weeks" with the Christmas and New Year holidays, said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics
Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y. "The true trend will re-emerge sometime in January."Claims have averaged 343,640 a week this year, down from 402,000 in 2003. Companies are holding onto more workers and in some cases are hiring to meet demand. "It's getting incredibly difficult for companies to squeeze more out of what they've got, and so it's becoming increasingly important for companies to hire," said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
New Year's Resolution: Start your own business
Staff Writer, The Career Digest
LAS VEGAS, NV -- Have you dreamed of owning your own business but don't know where to start? Franchises are becoming more and more popular as a way for people to buy and own their own business. Here are 4 main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you're able to operate your own business with the security of working with a large company. Second, the start-up, operations and general business plans are laid out for you with training and support from the franchisor. Third, you reduce your risk due to the success of the franchisor's reputation & experience. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to start a franchise than an independent business. If you've been thinking about
starting your own business, we recommend a free consultation with FranChoice, the premier "matchmaker" of the franchising industry.During your consultation, the consultants from FranChoice will help you identify franchise businesses that meet your criteria based on your goals, skills and preferences.

Neutralize age discrimination - 3 resume tips
Jean Cummings, Personal Brand Reporter
CONCORD, MA -- If you are 55, 48, or even 40 and looking for a job, you are probably wondering if age discrimination will affect you during the hiring process. According to ExecuNet, 84% of executives say that age discrimination is a serious problem, and 65% have encountered it in a job search (an increase of 7% just since 2001). Here are three resumes strategies to get you in the door:Dates. Do not list more than the last 10 to 15 years of experience. Avoid listing college and graduate school graduation dates.Content. Make the 10-15 years of your most recent experience count by giving concrete examples of how you benefited a company. Include times when your
experience and good judgment resulted in fewer false starts and costly errors.Strategy. Turn your age into a background issue. Make a strong case that you can meet a business need or "relieve the pain" an executive might be experiencing. Tell them how you can leverage your experience and skills to make money, save money, or solve problems.
One-Stop Resume Mailing to 1000's of Recruiters
Staff Writer, The Career Digest
NEW YORK, NY -- When looking for a job, you may want to consider working with a recruiter. Recruiters, otherwise known as head hunters or search consultants, are hired by companies to find candidates for them, and often know about unadvertised jobs.It's important to note, that recruiters do not charge the job seeker. The company pays a fee, typically when a candidate is hired. When contacting a recruiter send a resume and cover letter just as though you were applying for a job. If a recruiter calls you, always call back - even if you are not currently job hunting. You never know when circumstances might change and you might need job search assistance. If you don't know of
any good recruiters and/or want to instantly have your resume sent to 1000's of recruiters that specialize in people with your skills, one service, Resume Mailman can instantly email your resume to to 1000's of targeted recruiters. You can even get a list of the recruiters they forwarded your resume to for follow up. To try Resume Mailman, go to this link.
Think like an employer when writing your resume
Roberta Gamza, Career Marketing Consultant
DENVER, CO -- It's your resume - therefore it is your story, right? It may be your resume and your story, but to attract an employer's interest you must tell it from an employer's perspective. Put yourself in the role of the hiring manager for the position you seek before you start writing your resume.Employers are looking for results. They are concerned with sales, revenue, profit, market share, expenses, productivity, customer satisfaction, and industry perception. As an employee, your work will have an impact on at least one of these areas and more likely most or all of them.When employers look at your resume they want to know the results of your efforts. They do not
want to see long lists of tasks performed and a history of employers. Separate responsibilities from accomplishments. Quantify results whenever possible or at least speak about the impact of your efforts. If you modified a process, talk about the improvements stemming from that modification. If you sold X dollars of a product, include the context of the sale and state favorable comparisons to competitors, peers or industry averages.

Wendy Terwelp, Career Coach
MILWAUKEE, WI -- Another holiday party. Here comes Aunt Edna, "So, did you know your cousin Larry got a great promotion? He's earning six figures now. Oh yeah, what do you do again?"You're thinking, "Too bad Larry can't give me a job. If I could only stand to look at his bad comb-over." Instead you say, "Well, I'm between jobs right now." Wrong answer. Edna will never let that one lie. So, let's give Edna some ammo and get her to help you get hired.It takes three steps. Focus: What type of job do you want? Share: What do you have to offer that makes you unique? Tell: How can your network help you best? Now when you see Aunt Edna you can say confidently, "Well, I'm
looking for a public relations position. Recently, because of my contacts, I helped land the ABC company on WXYZ radio and their TV affiliate. You may have seen the touching story on the news. The PR helped increase their holiday sales 12 percent. Do you or Larry happen to know anyone at PR Giants? If so, I'd love to meet with them to find out the inside scoop."

Follow the bouncing ball
Pat Schuler, Business Development Coach
MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- How good are you at living with turbulence in your life? Many of us think we're pretty good until something like a career shift happens to us. Then we're like a juggler with too many balls in the air, trying to keep up, and watching in dismay as the balls start to rain down around our head.How do you keep track of all those balls? Ultimately, one ball at a time. Watch the ball, and not your hands. Concentrating on the toss and catch makes it easier to botch up. Hold in mind your goal of keeping the balls aloft. Stay on focus for your desired outcome - smooth transition form one ball to the next.What if you are terribly challenged by keeping all those
feisty balls in the air? Decide which balls are most important to keep airborne, and let the rest go. Even the greatest juggler has a limit. Recognize yours. Accept it graciously.
IT hiring outlook improving in 2005
Abridged: Earthweb.com
SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- CIOs expect a modest uptick in IT hiring in the first quarter of 2005, according to the Robert Half Technology's (RHT) IT Hiring Index and Skills Report. Eleven percent of executives polled plan to add staff early next year and two percent anticipate cutbacks. The net nine percent hiring increase is up three percentage points from the previous quarter's forecast and six percentage points ahead of the year-ago projection. For the fifth consecutive quarter, executives cited business expansion as the primary driver for IT hiring. CIOs in the Pacific and West South Central regions expect the strongest employment growth and networking remains the specialty most in
demand. Executives at the largest firms (1,000 or more employees) are most optimistic about IT hiring activity. Forty-one percent of CIOs who plan to hire during the first quarter cited business growth as the reason, while 26% require increased customer and end-user IT support. Systems upgrades and the installation or development of new enterprise wide applications followed, each receiving 10% of the response. For the third consecutive quarter, technology hiring at large firms continues to outpace the national average. Consider a different approach to your job search
Staff Writer, The Career Digest
VIRGINIA BEACH, VA -- Have you spent hours upon hours in your job search only to find that you get few responses back no matter how many resumes you email? These days emails are being deleted at a significant rate without ever being opened. And many hiring managers are simply overwhelmed with the amount of emailed resumes they have to go through. Consider a different approach. Try faxing your resume directly to employers you're interested in. When you fax your resume it is delivered already opened, unlike email. The recipient can't delete your resume prior to it being seen, and if your faxed resume is addressed to the actual decision maker it almost always ends up on that
person's desk. If this sounds like a good idea to you, we recommend using JobsByFax. This company has categorized 3.9 Million employers into about 73 categories. They'll quickly fax your resume directly to the exact type of employers you want in your selected geographic area.

Take advantage of primary resume real estate
Roberta Gamza, Career Marketing Strategist
DENVER, CO -- You have between five and 15 seconds to capture attention with your resume. Use the first 20 lines to compel the reader to want to know more about you. Think of this space as your only opportunity to keep your resume from being screened out. Display information in such a way that the reader can glean your value in a few seconds. Use titles not objectives. They quickly identify you and what position you want -- unlike vague, rambling objectives. Use value statements and qualifiers under the title to convey more value, i.e., Reversing Underperforming Operations or Building Profitable Strategic Partnerships. Speak in sound bytes. Use short phrases, headlines, and
keywords that quickly convey value. Use skills and expertise tables to quickly communicate your expertise and core competencies. The most valuable content on your resume is information that differentiates you from the competition. List credentials and specialized training, as well as any formal or informal honors, awards or recognition you received in your career. Mention publications, presentations, and speaking engagements. Display this information before you list your employers. It separates you from other candidates.

Unemployment claims rise 8,000 in latest week
Abridged: USAToday.com
WASHINGTON, DC -- New claims for unemployment benefits moved higher last week, a possible sign that employers are still cautious and are looking to cut costs. The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of new applications for unemployment insurance rose a seasonally adjusted 8,000 to 357,000 the week ended Dec. 4. That marked the highest level since late September. The newest snapshot of labor market activity was disappointing to economists. They were forecasting claims to drop to around 335,000. Higher energy bills and expensive health-care costs may be taking their toll on some companies - squeezing profits and forcing them to trim workers. The number of unemployed
people continuing to collect jobless benefits rose 91,000 to nearly 2.8 million the week ended Nov. 27, most recent period or which that information is available. That was the highest level since the end of October. Still, analysts are hopeful that slowing productivity growth will eventually result in businesses hiring workers to meet customer demand. The notion is that existing workers - who have powered efficiency gains - may finally be stretched too thin.

Help wanted ads soar on top job sites
Abridged: Mediapost.com
LOS ANGELES, CA -- For the third quarter in a row, the three top online job boards showed far greater year-over-year revenue growth from classified listings than did print newspapers, according to Corzen, Inc., a niche market research firm. Revenue for the top job boards--CareerBuilder, Monster, and Yahoo! HotJobs--was 47 percent higher in the third quarter of 2004 than the third quarter of 2003. Newspapers showed a growth of only 16 percent. Corzen CEO Bruce Murray called the difference in growth rates "dramatic." He said the latest report "all but confirms the view that online classifieds will eventually overtake print classifieds in volume and revenue." For the online job
boards, third-quarter ad revenue grew 11 percent from second-quarter revenues of $195 million. Job posting classifieds revenue for print newspapers fell 5 percent quarter-over-quarter from $1.15 billion. Erosion in help wanted ads is only one of the many threats online businesses pose to newspaper classifieds revenue. Peter Zollman, founding principal of Classified Intelligence, an Internet marketing consultancy firm, said that online companies are symptoms of an even bigger threat to newspapers--the fact that consumers, especially younger ones, are using different media.

Combatting career transition chaos
Pat Schuler, Business Development Coach
MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- What's one of the best ways to tell if you are in the middle of a major transition in your life? I heard a quote at a workshop last week that said chaos is always at the leading edge of change. Are you just changing jobs or is the universe sending you a message that a bigger change may be in the offing? Look at the amount of chaos in your life. If life looks pretty much like business-as-usual, this is probably a fairly standard job change. If, on the other hand, your chaos quotient seems a little higher than normal, you may be facing a major opportunity for change. Some clients find that the more they resist the idea of a major change, the more the chaos
increases. If they start to accept the idea of a major change, the chaos may diminish.Look at increasing chaos as a signpost pointing to change. What are you holding onto? What new direction should you investigate? What dream have you been ignoring?

Proven Wealth Building Strategies
Staff Writer, The Career Digest
LOS ANGELES, CA -- If you needed $24,000 in 24 hours, and your life depended on it, how would you do it? Recently on the Regis Philbin TV show, Robert G. Allen promised he could start with empty pockets and make $24,000 in 24 hours. Did it work? Sort of. He actually made over $94,000. Mr. Allen has repeatedly accepted challenges by the press and has proven time and again that his money making strategies actually work.Allen authored two of the best selling financial books in history: "Nothing Down" and "Creating Wealth." Commonly referred to as "America's  Millionaire Maker," Allen's claim to fame is taking ordinary people and successfully teaching them to create multiple

Surge in temp workers signals full-time hiring
Abridged: The Miami Herald
MIAMI, FL -- According to a recent American Staffing Association survey, staffing firms employed an average of 2.63 million workers per day, a 14 percent increase from the same period last year. History suggests permanent hiring follows a recovery in temporary staffing, a development that staffing executives and consultants are only just starting to see. "As the work comes back, companies say 'We're not sure that recovery is all the way here, so I'm going to go the temp route first,' " said Greg Bustin, president of Dallas business consulting firm Bustin & Co. "I think it's at a point where business leaders believe they are better off for a lot of reasons -- talent, training,
hiring -- to go ahead and hire full-time folks. That's just beginning to happen." "The biggest difference between this recovery and those from the early '80s and early '90s is businesses seem to take a longer look," said Richard Wahlquist, chief executive for the staffing association. "They are moving more cautiously in filling the full-time jobs. The real lesson coming out of the last downturn and jobs recession is to be cautious and not over hire."
Employers add 112,000 new jobs in November
Abridged: Boston.com
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Employers slowed their hiring as they headed into the holiday shopping season, adding just 112,000 new jobs in November for the weakest gain in five months. Still, the unemployment rate edged down, raising hopes that workers drawing paychecks will spend, spend, spend the rest of the year. November's 112,000 net increase in jobs, reported Friday by the Labor Department, was the lowest since July. It was about half what economists had forecast."It's not great job growth, but it's decent," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "It is decent enough to create income," which should help boost holiday spending and keep the economy chugging. November's unemployment rate slipped to 5.4 percent, calculated from a separate survey of households. That was down 0.1 percentage point, as more people looking for work found jobs.The department lowered job growth estimates from the previous two months by about 54,000, tempering October's blockbuster showing of 337,000 to 303,000. Economists said the October job boom appeared artificially high, fueled by hurricane cleanup activity in Florida and the Southeast.

Don't use these out-of-date strategies in your resume
George Blomgren, Tips From An Employer
MILWAUKEE, WI -- Nowadays pumping up resumes with pictures and a full listing of hobbies, activities, and interests is out of date.Hobbies rarely belong on resumes (and pictures, never). First, listing hobbies makes it look like you're trying to fill space. Maybe you do need to pad a sparse resume, but there are better ways. Second, your hobbies probably aren't relevant to an employer. Finally, the longer and more impressive the list of hobbies, the more you create an impression that your career isn't your priority. This isn't an impression you want to make.There are exceptions. If your hobbies are relevant, they may be included. If you are applying for a sales job in an
arts and crafts shop, an impressive list of hobbies may work in your favor. Also, recent students new to the working world get some leeway here: they may include a list of hobbies and extracurricular activities, as long as the activities listed are relevant and likely to be seen as positive (e.g., debate club - yes, poker shark - no).

Unadvertised Jobs: Get The Inside Track
Staff Writer, The Career Digest
If you're currently in the job market, here's the little known secret to tapping into the most lucrative, yet hidden jobs available. Even in this economy, there are still millions of great jobs out there. It's just that many of the best ones never make their way to the classifieds. Instead, they're taken by people who know about them before they're ever advertised. Imagine how great it would be if you had thousands of friends who'd always tell you about unadvertised jobs that you're perfect for.As they say, it's not what you know it's who you know. The secret to getting the unadvertised jobs is to make friends out of really good recruiters. And not just a few, but LOTS of
them. Here's why, and how you do it:Recruiters, otherwise known as headhunters or search consultants, are hired by companies to find candidates to fill open positions. These jobs are often never advertised. But the secret of how to best use recruiters is to first realize that contrary to popular belief they don't work for you. This is an important fact that most job seekers don't understand. The key to maximizing recruiters is to understand the following: Recruiters don't find jobs for people -- they find people for jobs. It's an important distinction to understand if you want to get a job through a recruiter.In other words, recruiters service the people who will pay them today. And unless you're paying a recruiter out of
your pocket today, don't expect them to canvas the world to find you a job. You'll only be disappointed. Recruiters will be interested in you if you meet the criteria of a job one of their client companies has asked them to fill, or they believe they'll soon be asked to fill.So to get the hidden jobs, you have to realize it's a numbers game and you must play it well by getting your resume to as many recruiters as you can, that specialize in people with your skills, in your field and in your geographic area. You can search the internet and find various lists of executive recruiters. However, they're not well organized, complete or easy to find. It might take you a great deal of time. Alternatively if you want to instantly
get your resume in the hands of 1000's of specialized recruiters, try a service like Resume Mailman by clicking this link.Resume Mailman will instantly put your resume directly into the hands of 1000's of America's very best recruiters. The ResumeMailman network is filled with pre-screened and talented recruiters that have connections to tons of unadvertised jobs. Your resume is instantly emailed to 1000's of recruiters in your selected areas, specializing in your selected skill sets.With Resume Mailman the process of getting your resume out to these recruiters takes about 10 minutes! You can even get a confidential email address for your resume AND receive a
contact list of all the recruiters who received your resume. Following up with these recruiters will only help move you to the top of their minds and your resume to the top of the stack. This is a very effective yet little known way to quickly gain access to the unadvertised jobs. To check out Resume Mailman, go to this link.While some recruiters may not have something for you today, if their clients regularly look for people with your skills, they will add you to their database. That's a good thing. The first place a recruiter looks when a client comes to them with a job to fill, is their own personal candidate database. It's never too late or too early to start
networking with recruiters in your area who specialize in people like you. Give yourself the competitive edge and get the inside track on unadvertised jobs. Just get your resume to as many recruiters as possible that specialize in your skills, industry and location. They say there's strength in numbers. Why not give a number of recruiters the opportunity to fill their open positions with you? Try Resume Mailman now. Contact The Career Digest:

Maximizing your salary potential
Abridged: CNN.com
ATLANTA, GA -- Negotiating a salary is never easy. In fact, it's something that makes many people downright petrified. However, negotiating a fair salary and benefits package right off the bat is even more important than you might think. Some job candidates simply take the first package a company offers, thinking higher pay will come once they have proven themselves. Beware of this tactic, says Ron Krannich, co-author of "Dynamite Salary Negotiations." One important area to consider in your compensation package is how you will be rewarded each year for your performance as well as how your salary will meet cost-of-living increases. Krannich points out that there is a difference
between a raise to cover inflation and one for excellent performance. For example, receiving a typical 3 percent raise each year will generally just cover inflation and allow the company to cover its bases. Krannich notes that if an employee deserves to be rewarded, that employee should receive a raise that goes above the inflation rate. "You want to make sure you are protected against inflation, but that's a base line," Krannich says. "A raise should be given for performance, not inflation."

Liar, liar pants on fire
Wendy Terwelp, Career Coach
MILWAUKEE, WI - According in to a recent survey by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, 10 to 30 percent of candidates "shade the truth or flat-out lie on their resumes" and 52% of resumes (in a sample of 249,000) have "discrepancies." The five biggest lies? Education, job title, compensation, reason for leaving, and accomplishments. We all want to look good on paper to get our foot in the door. Here are some strategies to think about when developing your resume: First, avoid lying. Second, eliminate compensation and reason for leaving from a resume. Yes, applications require this information, but resumes do not. Third, use the job title you were given. If relevant,
slash it with one that defines what you do. For example: Administrative Assistant / Public Relations Specialist. This person, despite having the title of administrative assistant, planned all PR activities and handled media relations. Fourth, use your correct educational background. This is so easily checked that lying about this is a big mistake. Fifth, stick to the facts with regard to your accomplishments. Use numbers, percentages, and sales figures. Dig into your old reports and performance evaluations to find the right information. The facts will still make you look good.
Walking students through job-search missteps Abridged: The Plain Dealer
CLEVELAND, OH -- Landing a job is tough enough when you have little experience. Some young job hunters make it even harder with silly missteps. Recruiters see easily remedied blunders: carelessly written resumes, goofy e-mail addresses, casual dress at career fairs and other gaffes. Colleges are trying to stamp out such mistakes with workshops and one-on-one counseling.Some of the flubs "can be attributed to generational differences and to being naive about what is important to recruiters," said Kevin Hewerdine, career services director at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. "First impressions are critical." So colleges stress that being sloppy or too casual can mean doom. Paula Quenoy, associate director for career services at Loyola University constantly warns against using cell phone numbers on resumes because students tend to answer casually. Generally, students are receptive to criticism, say advisers, who preach that even tiny mistakes scream out to potential employers. Chris Plouff, career services director at Grand Valley State said students who shoot off instant messages to each other often don't think about grammar or proofreading. And they depend too heavily on spell-checking computer programs, which don't catch word misuse: such as "their" vs. "there."

One way to shortcut a costly job search
Staff Writer, The Career Digest
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The average job search now lasts 18 weeks, according to 2004 data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. And given that the typical American worker takes home $34,020 in salary, those 18 weeks between jobs add up to a stunning $11,776 in lost paychecks, according to the same data.That's a harsh realty for most job seekers, who frequently have less than 30 days worth of savings to pay the rent and put food on the table. One way to shortcut this stressful job search process is to send out the very best resume possible, because finding a job just 3 or 4 weeks faster with an outstanding resume can put thousands of dollars in lost salary back in your
pocket.Many job hunters are finding work faster using the latest edition of "Resume and Cover Letter Secrets Revealed." With copy-and-paste examples and insider job-search tips, this how-to guide has become an Internet best-seller. It's very affordable and comes with a money-back guarantee.

Courtesy counts in your job search
Wendy Terwelp, Career Coach
MILWAUKEE, WI -- "I just read your article about thank-you notes. It amazes me how few people actually do this," said Rich Lampereur, financial services manager. "The job search process is about understanding and following the rules," he said. "And most people don't accept that fact. They often excuse themselves for breaking the rules because 'they didn't know the rules.'" Lampereur had harsh words for those who don't make an effort, "There are enough resources out there to tell you what the rules are and if you are not dedicated enough to go out and look for the rules during the interview process, you're not going to do it in your job when you're my employee. Thus, I don't want
you!"What are some of the basics? 1) Write thank-you notes to interviewers after you had the interview. Recap your desire for the position and your key qualifications. 2) Address correspondence to the correct parties. "To Whom It May Concern" lands in the circular file. 3) Use a firm handshake. Crushing to see who's the strongest is a no-no and the "limp fish" lacks enthusiasm. 4) Wear clean, pressed, well-fitting, appropriate clothing to your interview. 5) If you're on a lunch interview, wait until the interviewer orders so that you order something comparable. Don't order messy foods or finger foods. Free industry and trade publications Staff Writer, The Career Digest
