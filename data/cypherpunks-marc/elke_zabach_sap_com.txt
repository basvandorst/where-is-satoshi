This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand
this format, some or all of this message may not be legible.
If you could please be a little more precise:
which version of kernel and of JDBC do you use?
can you reproduce the problem?
if yes, please provide the statement causing the problem plus the schema-information needed for the tables/views used in the statement
(including index-definitions, triggers)
plus the knldiag of that kernel-run
plus a vtrace according to   with that statement used for step 2.
If the error only occurs in case of some data (and works with other) that example-data
would be fine.
With this info we will have a chance to answer if your version may be too old,
if it is a new-found-bug an how to overcome the problem.
Or do we have to assume because of some similarity of names that
ajit_cus's two mails and yours have anything to do with each other
and that part of the info was sent before ? Oops, his third arrived.
