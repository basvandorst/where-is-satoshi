See below :)
That's something that exists in "that box" over there, not "Tor's  box" ;)
AKA, as little of latency as possible... which is still quite a bit  actually, thank you bittorrent :(
If all clients in the network created Tor circuits of the same length,  all at the same time, wouldn't that mangle that analysis of who's  telescoping circuit-extension request is who's?  I know that's not  what cover traffic does... but if Tor has some sort of "heart beat"  that would make it more difficult to distinguish between which circuit- extension request is who's... that's only feasible because all clients  have a stake in circuits, not the same for external-to-to requests,  like webpages etc etc...
But not necessarily tested in the wild... Even the Bauer et al.  demonstrates those ideas in a fake Tor network, yes, on recommendation  from Tor not to do the experiment in Tor, but still.  And on PL, the  VM environment is particularly prone to latency, so of course timing  analysis attacks will stick out like a sore thumb...
so there might actually be something to deploying that exp on the real  what does that mean?  :)
