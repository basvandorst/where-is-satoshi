Yes... I was fishing in there the other day trying to work out how it
did buffering. In the end I just buffered in my application and let it
make a packet (and corresponding SSL context) every time I called its API.

What threat model are we really talking about with so called
"Deterministic Builds"?
When I worked in embedded software near the turn of the century we put
some effort into trying to detect meaningful differences is different
builds of the same source tree. i.e. ignoring timestamps but seeing what
different compilers did or different runs of the same compilers, etc.
(We failed miserably because we didn't have enough engineering time for it).
When I first heard of this "Deterministic Build" stuff again a few
months ago my first thought was to things such as the Thompson Bug.
Now some of the excitement^W hype has died down it seems like we might
just be talking about a threat model where an adversary manages to
inject an arbitrary binary into a distribution chain.
Of course, diff style tooling may also be able to detect variants of the
Thompson Bug, but do people think that finding that kind of technology
in the wild is a realistic prospect?

I'm running Iceweasel on Debian and I'm unique in their set as well.
Judging from their summary table, the "System Fonts" entry seems to be
the thing that identifies me. Fonts from my ~/.fonts/ directory are
being listed there so I guess I've got the system set plus my personal
set. I wonder how unique the system set is and how much of it comes from
the base OS and how much is contributed from selectable packages.
Perhaps Debian's popcon can be put to work to shed some light on
possible font packaging refactoring?
