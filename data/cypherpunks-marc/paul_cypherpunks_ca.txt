Yes that was the original intent, but I remember the reason for optin
was that it was impossible to realisticly fit the .com zone in the RAM
of modern servers at the time. Also signing would have taken much longer
to generate all the NSEC(3) records.
In general, the TLDs preferred a phased-in deployment where they could
exchange hardware over time. That is what optin offered, at the expense
of making spoofing just a tiny bit harder instead of much harder for
non-DNSSEC domains. Seems like a normal economical based decision to me.
These days, I don't think anyone should still run with opt-in anymore.
About as many as we have cryptography and cypherpunks mailing lists :P

Reasoning that way, you're very quickly left with not but a tin foil
hat. Let's say we agree on twofish. then NIST/NSA certifies it for FIPS.
Are we than taking that as proof it is compromised and figure out
something else?
People forget the NSA has two faces. One side is good.  NIST and FIPS
and NSA are all related. One lesson here might be, only use FIPS when
the USG requires it. That said, a lot of FIPS still makes sense. I'm
surely not going to stick with md5 or sha1.
Yes, like the IETF brainpool drafts.
The IETF is an independant body but only as good as the academic and
open cryptography community. And for those crypto people complaining
on the lack of crypto knowledge within the IETF, you have no excuse
not to participate. IETF carefully tries to not invent crypto.

If you mean the SCA 6000, those were $1600 at Sun. When Oracle bought
them they just bumped it to $10k. On ebay you can see listings right
now for $300-$750 for used ones, with the familiar traces of heated up
plastic :)
And yes, no one should use them as accelerator. They only have an HSM
function at this point. And in practise, they've turned out to be a
bit troubled with overheating and crashing linux drivers.

by unknown key.
Revocation could have been done by the person who stole the keys too.
That in itself is not good enough.
Which I cannot find on either pgp.mit.edu or pgp.surfnet.nl. I did find
them on keyserver.pgp.com, but I don't know who runs it and with the
additional captcha software, no idea if that is compromised :P
It is announced using short keyids, not to be trusted, and no finger
prints although we can get those from the key used to sign this message
I guess.

I fetched CA57AD7C which has 6863 signatures on it. It seems to be some
PGP global directory key, signed by a few people I know, but still seems
to be only proof that it came from the keyserver, not that the key
actually belongs to you.
But is that first key signed by the old keys? (which of course could
also have been done by the attacker, so you need to re-start a web
of trust with some of your personal confidants.
from an unknown key - with no direct signatures of any known trustable
key run by a human.
