TCPA is a way to raise the walls between programs executing in different protection spaces.  So far, so good.  Now -- tell me the last time you saw an OS flaw that directly exploited flaws in conventional memory protection or process isolation?  They're *very* rare.
The problems we see are code bugs and architectural failures.  A buffer overflow in a Web browser still compromises the browser; if the now-evil browser is capable of writing files, registry entries, etc., the user's machine is still capable of being turned into a spam engine, etc.  Sure, in some new OS there might be restrictions on what such an application can do, but you can implement those restrictions with today's hardware.  Again, the problem is in the OS architecture, not in the limitations of its hardware isolation.
I can certainly imagine an operating system that does a much better job of isolating processes.  (In fact, I've worked on such things; if you're interested, see my papers on sub-operating systems and separate IP addresses per process group.)  But I don't see that TCPA chips add much over today's memory management architectures.  Furthermore, as Dan points out, it may make things worse -- the safety of the OS depends on the userland/kernel interface, which in turn is heavily dependent on the complexity of the privileged kernel modules.

Microsoft's current secure coding initiative is a good idea, and from what I've seen they're doing a good job of it.  In 5 years, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the rate of simple bugs -- the buffer overflows, format string errors, race conditions, etc. -- was much lower in Windows and Office than in competing open source products.

Not quite, but see below.
BGP is indeed complex -- not the theory, but the practice: how it's
actually used.
Fundamentally, BGP is a way to implement routing *policy*: ISPs
(actually, ASs -- Autonomous Systems) use BGP so that traffic they're
carrying goes the way it's supposed to, more or less.  The metric, of
course is money -- what do they get paid for certain traffic over
certain paths, compared to others?  Among the many criteria that are
considered are traffic engineering, load-balancing among different
links, reducing latency for certain kinds of traffic, balancing bytes
and packets sent and received to certain BGP neighbors, minimizing the
number of prefixes you have to carry around in your routers (currently
about 240K for the so-called "default-free zone"), AUP restrictions,
customer satisfaction, redundancy, regulation, and more.
You can't just connect a couple of random Ethernets and have things JFW
(Just Work), the way you can with LANs in a building.  For one thing,
the Internet is too big; OSPF won't handle nearly that many prefixes.
For another, no one will (or rather, no one should) let you blindly
claim to carry traffic for random prefixes.  (The reality of that is
quite different and much more crypto-relevant...)

Courts very rarely issue broader rulings than they absolutely have to.
*Given the facts of this particular case* -- where Federal agents have
already seen the putatively-illegal images -- it strikes me as unlikely
there will be definitive ruling in either direction.  Let me refer folks to Orin Kerr's blog on the original ruling:
 .  I rarely agree with
Kerr; this time, after thinking about it a *lot*, I concluded he was
likely correct.  I suggest that people read his post (including all the
'click here to see more' links, which seem to require (alas)
Javascript) and the precedents cited.  It doesn't mean I agree with all
of those rulings (I don't), or that I think the courts should rule
against Boucher.  What I'm saying is that based on precedent and the
facts of this case, I think they will.
Here's a crucial factual excerpt from Kerr's blog:
Also note this text from the original ruling (at
 supporting Boucher:
The legal issue is very narrow: is entering the password "testimonial",
and thus protected?  Again: "both parties agree that the contents of the
laptop do not enjoy Fifth Amendment protection as the contents were
voluntarily prepared and are not testimonial."
Beyond that, Boucher waived his Miranda rights in writing and showed the
agent the (I assume) relevant folders.  That, coupled with the
precedents from Fisher, Hubbell, etc., make it likely, in my
non-lawyerly opinion, that the government will prevail. *But* -- I
predict that the ruling will be narrow.  It will not (I suspect and
hope) result in a ruling that the government can always compel the
production of keys.
(Philosophical aside: I've never been happy with the way the Fifth
Amendment has been interpreted.  To me, it's about freedom of
conscience, rather than freedom from bringing punishment upon oneself.
The law supports that in other situations -- the spousal exemption, the
priest-penitent privilege, etc.  This is why grants of immunity and
especially use immunity have always troubled me.  I recognize, though,
that this is not the way the law works.)
So -- I suspect that Boucher is going to lose.  The real question is
whether the ruling will be narrow, based on these facts, or whether
some judge will issue a broad ruling on witholding keys.

But is it cash?  When my son was four years old, he asked me why a dollar

things with it, it's money, unless it has some intrinsic utility of its own;
if it does have intrinsic value, it's a barter transaction.  Calling it

The two Ian G's have it correct: while OTR provides (some level of) lack of evidence within the system, it says nothing about external evidence like netflow records, which machine the logs were taken from, etc.  To pick one bad example -- bad because I don't know if it fits the facts of this case -- if one party to a purported conversation turned over a log file, and forensic examination of the second party's computer showed the same log, I suspect that most people would believe that those two parties had that conversation.  Of course, the authenticity of the log files could be challenged -- did the first party hack into the second party's computer and plant the log file?  had someone else hacked into it and used it to talk with the first party? -- but that's also outside the crypto protocol.
Put another way, the goal in a trial is not a mathematical proof, it's proof to a certain standard of evidence, based on many different pieces of data.  Life isn't a cryptographic protocol.

No, I don't think that that's quite what the ruling said.  It's a long, com=
plex opinion; what you said is close to one aspect of it, but not (in my no=
n-lawyer opinion) precisely what the court said.
The first point, not addressed in your note but quite important to the ruli=
ng, is that the key has to be something you know, not something you have.  =
If the keying material is on a smart card, you have to turn that over and y=
ou're not protected.  If a PIN plus smart card is needed, you still have to=
 turn over the smart card but not disclose the PIN.
Second, and going to the heart of your point, what's essential is whether o=
r not they already know in reasonable detail what's on the encrypted drive;=
 depending on the circumstances, they may already have that knowledge regar=
dless of what you've said.  The issue of admitting possession is not what t=
his case focused on; in fact, the prosecution tried to finesse that point b=
y granting limited immunity on that point.  Quoting from the opinion:
=93the use [of Doe=92s] act of production of the unencrypted contents=94 of=
 the hard drives. That is, Doe=92s immunity would not extend to the Governm=
ent=92s derivative use of contents of the drives as evidence against him in=
 a criminal prosecution. The court accepted the U.S. Attorney=92s position =
regarding the scope of the immunity to give Doe and granted the requested o=
rder. The order =93convey[ed] immunity for the act of production of the une=
ncrypted drives, but [did] not convey immunity regarding the United States=
=92 [derivative] use=94 of the decrypted contents of the drives.'
In other words, the fact of control of the encrypted data -- aka knowledge =
of the key -- was not at issue; the prosecution had agreed not to use that.=
  What was important was the files on the drive.  This is what distinguishe=
s this case from Boucher (a case discussed in the opinion).  =
The other current case is Fricosu, where a trial judge has ordered her to d=
ecrypt her laptop.  The Court of Appeals for that circuit -- the 10th; the =
opinion I cited is from the 11th, and hence not binding on this court -- de=
clined to hear her appeal, not on the merits but because as a matter of pro=
cedure they won't intervene at this point in a trial.  If she's convicted, =
she can appeal on the grounds that her Fifth Amendment rights were violated=
, but not until then.  It's worth noting that the trial judge made his ruli=
ng on the same basis as the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals: did the governme=
nt have enough prior knowledge of the contents that her rights were not inf=
ringed?  An appellate court may find that he didn't rule correctly on that =
point, or it may decline to adopt the 11th Circuit's reasoning -- but the f=

No, you're quite correct.  Depending on what you assume, that would take

I think, though, that that isn't the real issue.  We're talking about a
feature that would be used by about .0001% of gmail users.  Apart from
code development and database maintenance by Google -- and even for =
neither is free -- it requires a UI that is comprehensible, robust, and
doesn't confuse the 99.9999% of people who think that a certificate is
something you hang on the wall.  (Aside: do you remember how Netscape
displayed certs -- in a frame with a curlicue border?  These are =
they should look the part, right?  I'm just glad that the signature =
denoted by 3-D shadowing on a "raised" seal....) Furthermore, the UI has
to have a gentle way of telling people that the cert has changed, which
may be correct.  (Recall that for some of these users, they didn't =
the cert; it was done by the admin of a site they use.) Do you run Cert
Patrol (a Firefox extension) in your browser?  It's amazing how much =
there is among certificates used by big sites (including Google itself).
Certificate pinning is a great idea for experts, but it requires expert
maintenance.  I haven't yet seen a scalable, comprehensible version.
I wish Google did support this, but I don't think it's unreasonable of
them not to.  Recall that they've been targeted by governments around =
world, precisely the sort of adversary who can launch active attacks.  =
if you want to say that these adversaries can also corrupt CAs, whether
they do it technically, procedurally, financially, or by sending around

I won't argue; I certainly remember the Diginotar case.  There may even
be a lesser threat from using self-signed certs, since these large
individuals operate on a human time frame, so it's more scalable to hit
a few large CAs than a few thousand dissidents or other targets of
interest.  I think, though, that there are arguments on both sides.
