Hi cprise,
Thanks for cheering me up! :)
Yes, that perspective is a nice upside take on these situations.
I wonder if something like the following is possible, despite an isolated Qubes storage domain...
Since the hard drive (and other devices) have their own physical computing resources inside of them, with a firmware modification, could they be used to do a MotS (man-on-the-side) style attack to other key hardware components or flows in the system and strategically record/interrupt/inject/modify other processes of the computer?
I don't know enough detail about the physical architecture of computers to determine this, but, our individual components, like hard drives now have non-trivial hardware resources of their own and a direct connection into our motherboards.
A higher bar indeed, but the notion reminds me of the MotS internet backbone packet injection attacks that are routinely being carried out with internet traffic. But, since they can already get into and replace hardware firmware, I'm wondering what the limits of capability are with holding such a deep position inside of the system's hardware.

Hi there Kersten,
Great idea. This would be really neat!
I wonder if this is like the encryption described in the Qubes architecture spec doc, where the AppVMs and Dom0 only know the per VM private storage keys and the hard drive is behind an untrusted Storage

And no reason why other hardware components can't do the same.
So basically we are no longer using computers, but rather we now use computers-on-top-of-computers. Where the outer-computer is what we think we control with Qubes, etc, but the true inner-computers are the hardware components that can independently act like root privileged computers and directly pwn our entire system.
Great. ;(
