Well I have a question which is off the top of megaupload.com
But it's regarding governments around the world using cloud services.
Do we have others Canadians on this list who can confirm, what branches of the Canada Government are actively using public cloud services like google cloud services.
or are in the process are currently setting it up.

But fortunately the data is also replicated in another data center
nowhere near the quake, so once they pull out the mobile emergency
operations center and aim the VSAT dish, they're back online with
everything as it was moments before the quake hit... far superior to
what formerly happened when the power or phone lines were down at their
own facility, never mind what would have happened if their own facility
with its infrequent backups to unreliable tape were destroyed.

I don't mean either -- I've only skimmed the indictment.  But from the
news stories, it would *appear* that they got a search or wiretap warrant
to get at employees' email.  I don't see how that would make it "not
private".  (Btw -- "due diligence" is a civil suit concept; this is a
criminal case.)  The prosecution is trying to claim that the targets
had actual knowledge of what was going on.
I do know Orin Kerr, however.  He's a former federal prosecutor and he's
*very* sharp, and I've never known him to be wrong on straight-forward
legal issues like this.  He himself may not have all the facts himself.
But here are two sample paragraphs from the indictment:
On or about August 31, 2006, VAN DER KOLK sent an e-mail to an
associate entitled lol.  Attached to the message was a screenshot
of a Megaupload.com file download page for the file Alcohol 120
1.9.5 3105complete.rar with a description of Alcohol 120, con
crack!!!!  By ChaOtiX!.  The copyrighted software Alcohol 120 is
a CD/DVD burning software program sold by On or about June 24, 2010, members of the Mega Conspiracy were
informed, pursuant to a criminal search warrant from the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, that thirty-nine
infringing copies of copyrighted motion pictures were believed to
be present on their leased servers at Carpathia Hosting in Ashburn,
Virginia.  On or about June 29, 2010, after receiving a copy of
the criminal search warrant, ORTMANN sent an e-mail entitled Re:
Search Warrant Urgent to DOTCOM and three representatives of
Carpathia Hosting in the Eastern District of Virginia.  In the
e-mail, ORTMANN stated, The user/payment credentials supplied in
the warrant identify seven Mega user accounts, and further that
The 39 supplied MD5 hashes identify mostly very popular files that
have been uploaded by over 2000 different users so far[.] The Mega
Conspiracy has continued to store copies of at least thirty-six
of the thirty-nine motion pictures on its servers after the Mega
Conspiracy was informed of the infringing content.

Well they did take down megaupload.com and the sister website mega video.
But now with one of the worlds biggest websites down. Others will step up to take over Megaupload's place.
Well maybe depending on trial etc.
