LipWorks Lip Plumping serum creates fuller,
plumper, sexier lips, NATURALLY
        Oceana LipWorks is made of natural Botanical extracts and essential
oils.  LipWorks is 99% natural,
        unlike other lip plumping products on the market today.  Check
their labels and you will find that most
        are FULL of chemicals!  Who wants to kiss that???
        LipWorks creates lasting, fuller lips in two ways:
        First, the natural extracts immediately increase blood flow to the
lips, making them plumper and a deeper red.
        Next your body's creation of collagen, elastin and proteins is
stimulated, resulting in increased production
        of these in your lips. This last part is what gives LASTING
results, since you are dealing with your own collagen.
        Plumping up your lips with moisturizers only produces temporary
results that disappear in hours or days.
        Your lips will be fuller, softer and sexier, without surgery or
artificial collagen injections.
        LipWorks Lip Plumping serum is a non-greasy, water soluble formula
in a 5ml applicator bottle selected
        for ease of application and maximum absorption for maximum results.
A seaweed compound base was chosen for
        its simplicity and greater capacity to deliver the significant
ingredients in a more bio-available form.
        Each 5ml tube (only $24.95 plus Shipping & Handling) of LipWorks
has enough serum for between 150 - 200
        applications. LipWorks is sold with a 30-day prompt product refund
guarantee. You may also order LipWorks
        from a trained customer representative at 1-877-892-4808.
How To Use LipWorks
        Directions:  Begin with clean, dry lips. Shake the bottle a few
times to get the serum onto the roller ball.
        Then apply LipWorks Serum to your upper and lower lips,
        making sure you cover the entire lip evenly. Massage your lips with
the applicator or by pressing them together
        firmly for a few seconds. The product will be absorbed into your
lips and you may notice a slight tingling effect
        afterward. Because LipWorks is natural (color is the only
ingredient not from nature), you may notice the serum
        becoming darker in color over a period of time.  This is normal and
does not affect the effectivness of the serum
        and results you can obtain from LipWorks.
Tips for using the product:
        Be sure and give your lips good coverage, fully covering the skin
of the lips as well as going into the 'inner'
        lip area a little bit.  You can work the serum into your lip tissue
by pressing your lips together after application.
        Wait a minute, then apply lip gloss or lipstick as you normally
        When you first begin using the product, we suggest you apply
LipWorks a minimum of three times a day,
        in the morning, mid day and before you go to bed.  Feel free to use
the serum throughout the day if you
        want to jump start your lips even more.  LipWorks is natural, so
you can use it as often as you like.
