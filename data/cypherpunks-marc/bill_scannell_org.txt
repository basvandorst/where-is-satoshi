Russian officials reject tourist
MOSCOW (AP) -- Officials rejected a South African Internet tycoon's bid to
fly to the International Space Station because he made unreasonable demands,
Russian news agencies reported Friday.
Mark Shuttleworth, 27, underwent a month of tests and preparation at the
Star City cosmonaut training center outside Moscow over the summer. But the
Cape Town native failed to conclude a contract to become the second tourist
in space. California tycoon Dennis Tito, who reportedly paid $20 million to Russia's
cash-strapped space agency, made an eight-day trip to the station last
spring. "All attempts to bring Shuttleworth's conditions into correspondence with
regular practice have been abortive," the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Russian Space Agency director Yuri Koptev as saying.
Koptev said that Shuttleworth had insisted on a minimum of two weeks in
space, instead of the eight to 10 days the space agency favored.
"This demand would throw off the flight schedule," Koptev said.
Koptev said that Shuttleworth had also expected a free second flight to
space if the first spacecraft failed to dock with the station, ITAR-Tass
reported.

PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AL Digital Acquires Second Nuclear Bunker
Doubles Space Available for Security of Computer Assets
London, UK (1 October 2001)  AL Digital (Telecommunications), Ltd.,
a leading provider of secure computer hosting and owner of The
Bunker, today announced the purchase of a second nuclear bunker from
the Ministry of Defence.  The terms were undisclosed.
This second bunker now known as The Other Bunker will effectively
double the space available for the secure storage and hosting of
Britain's digital economic assets.  Located northeast of London, The
Other Bunker will undergo retrofitting before being deployed as a
computer co-location facility.
The Bunker and The Other Bunker were designed and built during the
Cold War as physically secure communications centres. Both offer the
ultimate in protection from a myriad of attacks including; crackers,
terrorist attack, electro-magnetic pulse, HERF weapons, electronic
eavesdropping and solar flares.
The rate of firms moving into The Bunker has accelerated dramatically
in recent weeks, creating the need for additional secure computing
space in the UK.  "Increased demand has caused us to move forward our timetable ," said
AL Digital Director Dominic Hawkin. "The Other Bunker needs to be
open for business sooner than we planned."
The Other Bunker is scheduled to have its first client servers
installed by mid-2002.  The storage capacity of the The Bunker will
be able to absorb the needs of the market until that time. ENDS
About The Bunker and The Other Bunker
The Bunker is redefining the market for secure hosting. The facility
provides the physically secure environment needed to protect
digitally secure data.  All the encryption in the world can't stop a
server from being stolen, sabotaged or destroyed: The Bunker does.

In a recent post to the cypherpunks mailing list, I implied that you were a

I was wrong.
What I meant to say was that I believe you to be a sad, pathetic teenager of
limited intelligence who has never quite recovered from the wedgies meted
out by your betters.  That you eschew the name your parents gave you in
favor of the nom de perdant 'mattd' ( (door)matt?) proves well the point.

your limited qualifications, you might find your self-respect improved to
the point where you can contribute in a positive way to society.

If we had just a few more 'fools' like John in this country, it might not
suck as much as it does at present.
     Virus Borrows Internet Pioneer's Server To Spread
By Brian McWilliams, Newsbytes SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 06 Mar
2002, 9:46 AM CST A server operated by Internet pioneer John Gilmore is
being used by a new Internet worm to perform its mass-mailing routine,
according to virus researchers.
The address of the server, Toad. COM, is one of 25 open mail relays
hard-coded by its unidentified author into the W32.Yaha worm, according to
analyses by anti-virus firms Symantec and Sophos.
While most of the open servers are located in China and Korea, Toad. COM is
a system installed in Gilmore's home in San Francisco.
Besides co-founding the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Cypherpunks
cryptography discussion list, Gilmore takes credit for helping establish the
"alt" Usenet discussion groups.
Last March, Gilmore's Internet service provider, Verio, threatened to cut
off his service unless he secured Toad. COM so that it could not be used by
third parties to relay junk e-mail or "spam."
Since its discovery around Valentine's Day, Yaha, also known as "Valscr,"
has wormed its way past Nimda, Hybris and Funlove to the number eight
position on the current list of virus threats tracked by managed e-mail
provider MessageLabs.
Symantec has assigned Yaha a level-2 risk rating. The worm arrives with a
subject line, "Melt the Heart of your Valentine with this beautiful screen
saver." It comes with an attachment named "valentin.scr."
If executed, the attachment will install the worm and unleash its only
payload: mass-mailing copies of infected messages to addresses in the
Windows address book and e-mail addresses found in cached HTML files on the
victim's hard disk.
Gilmore, a life member of the Libertarian party, has accused Verio of
censorship and said he configured the mail server to accept and forward
e-mail from anyone in part so that friends could use it while traveling
around the world.
Gilmore was not immediately available for comment.
According to Gilmore's Web site, Verio agreed last August not to terminate
his service if he modified his mailer software to avoid forwarding large
quantities of e-mail from single addresses over short periods of time.
Jay Dyson, a security consultant with California-based Treachery Unlimited,
confirmed that Toad. COM remains "a wide-open relay."
According to Dyson, numerous methods exist for authenticating whether users
are authorized to relay mail through a server.
"I think Gilmore is being a stubborn old fool for leaving his mail systems
as open relays," he said.

of the Air Travelers Association.  Stempler obliged, saying that CAPPS II
testing was a fine idea and that "(w)hatever's going to be done will have to
be done in secret".
If Stempler sounds like a boot-licking toady, it's because he probably is:
his association appears to be little more than a front for the Cendant
Corporation, whose Galileo subsidiary stands to gain a new profit center if
CAPPS II is implemented.

Dear Patriot,
For the past seven months, I have been fighting for the right of all
Americans to travel freely in our own country.  CAPPS II, the Soviet-style
internal border control system being pushed by the Department of Homeland
Security, will strip us of that right, and make air travel a 'privilege'
granted by government.
A lot has been accomplished:
* Delta was shamed out of testing CAPPS II
* Homeland Security was forced to appoint a Chief Privacy Officer
* JetBlue was exposed violating the privacy of millions of passengers
* JetBlue was shamed out of CAPPS II testing
* A pro-CAPPS II 'consumer advocate' was unmasked as a Cendant shill
* Galileo/Cendant has backpedaled on CAPPS II
I need your help taking this fight forward.
Running the anti-CAPPS II campaign costs a lot of time and money.  The
Boycott Delta and Don't Spy On US websites require a team of graphic artists
and web designers.  As you can imagine, the bandwidth usage is enormous.
The over 40 million dollars in publicity generated for the ongoing
anti-CAPPS II awareness campaign came at a cost of hundreds of media
interviews, astronomical telephone bills, and all of my time and energy.
Up to now, I have funded this project out of my own personal savings.
America has been good to me and spending money to keep our country free
seemed only fair.  Unfortunately, I can't do this alone anymore, which is
why I am turning to you for help.
To keep up the fight, I need you to contribute to the cause.  Whether you
can afford $20.00 or $100.00; $50.00 or $1,000.00 , every cent you give
makes it possible to keep up the pressure on those who would make our great
nation less free.
There are two ways you can help fund the fight:
1. Use your credit card and contribute using PayPal:
           2.  Send a check or money order payable to 'Bill Scannell' in care of my
        The Electronic Frontier Foundation
        454 Shotwell Street
        San Francisco, CA 94110
Together, we can stop CAPPS II.
With deepest gratitude,

In a series of recent emails and telephone conversations between Galileo and
the Don't Spy On US team, the Cendant subsidiary claims they have not yet
provided any data for CAPPS II testing, but left the door wide-open to do so
in future. Galileo, which stands to gain a new profit center if CAPPS II is
implemented, admits to extensive contact with the Transportation Security
Administration, including "periodic discussions and thorough technical and
industry-related consultation".  The Cendant subsidiary says that they don't
plan on helping with CAPPS II testing pending "substantial change in world
market circumstances".
In plain English, Galileo is saying they'll collaborate if they feel like it
and if there's a buck to be made off of it.
