Someone who primarily uses webmail and big e-mail service providers.
Probably doesn't even /care/ about e-mail, e-mail isn't cool after all.

E-mail hygiene:
- Using aliases for every company you deal with, or using recipient
  delimiters like "+" so it is easier to find out which company sold you
  out.
- Exercise more caution when handing out your "primary" address
- Avoid services that like to spam your addressbook (see: LinkedIn etc.)
Spam fighting:
- Using DNSBLs to cut down on the crap
- Training spamassassin's DB with ham and spam.
- Enact rate limiting policies so that a compromised account can only do
  limited amount of damage.

Ease of access as opposed to setting up a client like
Thunderbird/Outlook/mutt etc.

The biggest problem being spam. We need to educate typical e-mail users
about e-mail hygiene and spam fighting.

Sure, lets tell them to move their e-mail from Gmail....to where? To
another big mail provider (whats the point then?). Lavabit, Silent
Circle, Hushmail, Tormail? Nope. Self host their own e-mail? Hah. Most
people don't have the resources and/or the ability to do something like
that. There is also the matter of trust, why should I trust $MAILHOST over
What is the solution then?
I hope I got my point across.

Gmail's new e-mail sorting system divides mail into three categories by
default - "primary", "social", and "promotions". The user can train the
filter by dragging and dropping and by creating new categories.
A quick look at avaaz.org's SPF record shows that they are using
Sendgrid, I doubt they will be having difficulties with deliverability.

Same engine, I guess they didn't bother removing it. It does absolutely nothing in Thunderbird because nothing will ever ask for your location in Thunderbird.

The Geo info feature in Firefox is an API provided so that *websites* can ask for location info in an easy and developer friendly way.
Firefox did not ask for location info, the website you were on did.

As for HTML e-mails always amusing to view the markup when reading in

My home Wi-Fi AP (a Mikrotik RouterOS) device is configured as WPA2 PSK
with TKIP and AES unicast/group ciphers. I see that I can uncheck the
TKIP check box, is this an acceptable workaround to the issue you mentioned?
