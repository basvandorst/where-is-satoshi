You might try running it under "padsp" while pulseaudio is installed and
running. You will need the pulseaudio-utils package to get padsp. Padsp
is intended for old apps that are not compatible with pulseaudio. It
intercepts the calls to the old sound driver and sends them to
pulseaudio. It is used like this:
$ padsp /path/to/skype
