21st century paradigm shifts, DELIVERED DAILY!
The "theory-edge" mailing list is for informal, collegial discussion of the latest research advances, and especially newsworthy cutting-edge or breakthrough developments, in the hardest problems in algorithmics. FREE! Try it out now!
3 YEARS OLD ** EST.MAY 1998 ** 700+ SUBSCRIBERS ** 4500+ MSGS

We're particularly seeking elite scientists, academics,
researchers, and practitioners such as PhDs and graduate students. We have a few "mini-celebrities" currently on the list.
Past traffic is diverse. 1st priority items of interest are recent news reports or media coverage on fresh advances or breakthroughs in these areas and subscriber reaction/commentary to them. Its a gift economy--please post them when you run into them! And more and more, we've already heard and discussed
the cool news *before* it hits the mainstream outlets!

Next, we're extremely interested in cutting-edge advances in computational methods, both on the applied and theoretical sides. A strong scientific component emerges from engaged and active subscribers. We've now had three major "open science", *world-class*
research projects and collaborations on the list. Its an exciting
treat to hear daily notes sent by researchers at the cutting edge!

Lots of cyber-synchronicity and synergy occurs among people's backgrounds when you get a lot of really intelligent and articulate researchers in the "same room"!

controversy. We're into discussing the work of any, alive or

absolutely dont tolerate fluff or hype!

When nothing else is going on, there's always something else
to muse about or write a mini-essay on, to shed some new
light on the subject! A scientific society for the 21st century!
