Work on the existing C/C++ language will have a better chance
of actually being used earlier. Not that it removes the problem
entirely, but it should catches a lot of easy stack smashing bugs.

But there is a necessary asymmetry here. If you could determine
with good precision whether someone will be affected by an illness,
when, how much, etc, then this wouldn't work, save for superstition
on the part of Joe Sixpack. Since the contract is based on a bet on
the likelihood of premium/payouts balance, the more you can find
out about the future of the insured person's organism future, the
closer the premiums will match the payouts, reliably. *IF* you can
determine this, of course. So the goal will be for the insurer to
get access to as much info as possible to assess how to set the
premiums, while preventing the insured from knowing as much, so
there is still the uncertainty and the value of "peace of mind"
gotten by the insured, and that's worth something too.
The converse is also true. And both raise the problem of assessment
of the data - how does the insurer get the data (getting DNA from
the would be insured ? with the insured's knowledge or not ? From
the contract clause that subordinates the insurance to the supplying
of the data by the insured ? Will credit bureaus expand to cover
this kind of thing ?)
If there is total symmetry, insurance loses its point entirely.
Could we see a gradual disappearance of some sorts of insurance
for events that cease to be probabilistic ?
Just musing. All of it already happens, but I'm curious about the
limit of it (in the mathemetical sense) when the precision of the
prediction tends towards infinity.

Ah, to make money off it of course! Advertize it, and people will
use it. Maybe. For a time. And when it wears off, you launch
another one. Sure, it's pointless technically, but so are many
gimmicks that are commercially viable, if only for a limited time.
And maybe the LEAs are actually even pushing it as a way to easily
catch clueless criminals :)

You could very well end up with all tails. That's a sequence
that has the same probability of happening that any other sequence.
A compressor will look for redundancy in the input you give it,
not in the algorithm you used to generate that input (conceptually,
a compressor could deduce the (determinist) algorithm from the
output, but if you bring it true randomness, chances are it will
not). Thus, a compressor will compress very well a sequence made
of all tails, but badly another which exhibits no detectable
Once you have the sequence, you lost a lot of info about whatever
algorithm was used to generate it. A sequence of all tails could
have been generated by a simple algorithm which generates all
tails. That's an emergement description of this one particular
sequence, but one that would not apply to *all* sequences your
algorithm can ever produce. That's lost information, and that's
why it can be compressed.

@_subject: RE: National Emergency? 
An interesting bit in is that the US president can perform an "introduction of United States
Armed Forces into hostilities" without Congress declaring war, if a
national emergency is in effect. So the war in Iraq would seem to be
essentially legal from a POV of US law. I previously thought that only
Congress could do this. National emergency is a very interesting bit
of the code to have if you have either a friendly majority in both
houses, or if opposing you would be seen as political suicide, as was
the case in late 2001... I wonder if the powers conferred include
anything like law enacting with Congress bypass (for speed, you know,
we don't want Congress delaying this very important new bit of anti
terrorist press quashing law...)

Well, people say the JAP team hid it, but with that (assuming the
strings appeared verbatim in the binary), they made sure someone
would spot it. They essentially made sure the users would be warned
about it while keeping plausible deniability.

Still useful to protect against third party eavesdroppers, I guess.
Short of onion routing, are there any other services like that around,
apart from the likes of anonymizer.com ? I've been using JAP for some
time, but mainly to hide my IP from visited sites. Guess I'll keep on
using it. I'm on Win32 BTW, as headers indicate. I'm at work, too
paranoid to access Internet from my own Unix box ;)

You can still do it and use such a rule with SpamAssassin or others,
while keeping a low score so that it slightly influences the results
but not too much.
Haven't tried it, but Bayesian filters might score good on that kind
of real text with random whole phrases, as tech email usually mixes
the two together (most spams I get that use these code letters do it
all at once, not interspersed with other normal text).

You miss out on the fact that, if Windows has, say, 90% of the
machines (disregarding differences between desktop/server/whatever),
the damage would, with your metric, be three times as large as the
cost you point at, which would affect a third of the machines (with
numbers higher than today, but still less that what they would be
with 90% of machines running MS).
Yes, you are right: when you don't put all your eggs in the same
basket, you have *more* risk to get crushed eggs. But, in return,
you have less risk of losing *all* your eggs. The point is to contain
worst case cost, at the expense of having more likely minimum cost.
Windows 2000 was only a few years ago too. Windows NT 3 and 4 were not
desktopo OSes, used only on servers. And I worked in a company that had
the misfortune of running an NT 3 server. Preemptive multitasking does
not imply stability, as this experience showed, though I won't claim our
experience was typical.
There was BeOS too, which could have been widely available save for MS
having the computer makers' ear (firmly grasped in an iron fist).
But you still have a fair point on this point, and I agree at varying
degrees with the rest of your points, except where you come back to:
For serial systems, not parallel ones. Encryption is a serial one.
Redundancy using different systems is not: you need to destroy all
branches to bring the system down (though I do not deny that you can
bring the quality of service down by bringing a node down, depending
on the degree of redundancy).
Of course, the above holds for a more or less homogeneous distribution
of the different (here) OSes. Otherwise, you have a connected graph of
monocultures, and the first argument applies.
