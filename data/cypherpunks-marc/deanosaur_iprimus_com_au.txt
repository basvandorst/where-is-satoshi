I recall a similar instance in the US about two years ago (damn if I
can find a citation at the moment). The legal issue was slightly
different than above, where the above claims he does not have to
surrender due to [possible] self incrimination.
In the previous the issue raised was whether a computer, obtained
through a warrant, also included the password to decrypt the data on
the computer. In the later, the judge ruled that the password to
decrypt the data was included since the warrant included the computer.
Standard disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, but I am interested in the
legal interpretations of these security related matters as most others
on the list.
