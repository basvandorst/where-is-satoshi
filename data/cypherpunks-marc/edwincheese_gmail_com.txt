I am not openssl expert and here is just my observation.
TLS frame messages into length-prefixed "records". Each records has a
1 byte contentType and a 2 byte record length, followed by the record
content and MAC.
Heartbeat messages are TLS records with contentType 24 of this content format:
   struct {
      HeartbeatMessageType type;
      uint16 payload_length;
      opaque payload[HeartbeatMessage.payload_length];
      opaque padding[padding_length];
   } HeartbeatMessage;
Note that there are two length fields involved, the TLS record length
and the heartbeat message payload_length. It is possible to construct
a heartbeat message that has the heartbeat payload_length larger than
the record length. The TLS heartbeat protocol further requires that
the respondent of heartbeat request should copy the payload to the
response. Failing to bound check the heartbeat message payload_length,
openssl may copy the memory region beyond the incoming record buffer
to the response buffer. The 64 k limit is the maximum possible size of
a TLS record because the length is 2 byte long.

A latest story for OpenSSL
The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL
cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the
information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption
used to secure the Internet. SSL/TLS provides communication security and
privacy over the Internet for applications such as web, email, instant
messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs).
The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the
systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This
compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to
encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual
content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop communications, steal data
directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.
