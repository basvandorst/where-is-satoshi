Whoo, I've just had a brilliant idea. =
It looks bad for the economy when a company shuts down -- so, the obvious s=

You could extend this to all sorts of things, like convincing the governmen=

Ta, I'm off to go write a business plan,

Ok, cute, thank you -- still suffers from the "I take a photo of the object=
, then blow it up. Three weeks later I print out the photo and take a photo=
 of the victim in front of it" attack, but I like the idea...
Yeah, this seems like the best -- I make a video showing an interaction of =
the victim with the random strangers and then kill the strangers. The inter=
action part mitigates the "take a photo and then place victim in front of p=
rintout" attack.
I'm assuming a *very* evil villain, whose primary weakness are an inability=
 to use photoshop / Gimp and a flair for overly complex plots.
He has, however read Peter's Evil Overlord List - "Go on, prove me wrong. Destroy the fabric of the universe. See if I care."=

Ok, so the "take a photo of the victim with todays newspaper" is a common (=
and fairly clever) kidnapping movie trick.
Presuming the kidnappers / attackers cannot use photoshop, this sets an *ea=
rliest* timestamp for an event[0].
I've often wondered if there is a clever way to do the inverse -- basically=
 to have a "latest" timestamp? This seems like a much harder problem -- 'm =
looking for a "movie plot" type solution that the public can easily underst=
The best solution I've heard so far (assuming, just like the kidnapping sce=
nario that the attacker doesn't know how to use photoshop!) is to take the =
photo outside, at night with a number of celestial bodies in the frame=85 =
Another solution is to take the photo / proof at a large, well documented a=
nd difficult to recreate event -- something like a presidential inauguratio=
n ceremony, large concert, etc.
Anyone have any other cute tricks?
And no, I don't actually need a solution here, it's just a thought experime=
[0]: It's not an actual timestamp, I could e.g take a photo of the newspape=
r from April 1912 to "prove" I was alive when the Titanic sank :-).
