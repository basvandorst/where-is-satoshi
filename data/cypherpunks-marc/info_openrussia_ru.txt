@_subject: Open the Russian market for your business 
Dear, Sirs,
We are glad to inform you that our company has been launched the Project "OpenRussia.ru" to help the entrepreneurs from the entire world access the Russian market and offer their products. This Project allows active search for potential partners in Russia. Russia has been showing a stable economic growth, and business cooperation with the Russian entrepreneurs has become mutually beneficial and effective.
When it comes to purchasing of any goods abroad or execution of a foreign trade transaction, the key issue for the Russian entrepreneurs is the problem of customs clearance (the customs duty amounts and collection procedures, clearing through the customs, certification of the imported goods, licensing of imports, etc.).  Our Project has been developed to address these and similar problems.
Please visit to  for more information and registration your offer in our catalogue.
Best regards,
The OpenRussia Team
