At the risk of getting political, I'd recommend against AU (I live there). Our new gummint has already shown that it will put its own interests ahead of those of the people (cancelling the proposed National Broadband Network springs to mind).
Switzerland, perhaps?  They have a history of secrecy...

[ I somehow missed the original; it's IanG quoting JohnL ]
Please don't make blanket statements like that.  I still use cheques for those organisations that do not take EFTPOS (small clubs etc), and I do not trust PayPal because unlike my Credit Union they are not governed by financial regulations; well, not last time I looked anyway.
I don't use Bitcoin because it appears to be far too speculative (witness the joe-jobs on them, for example), and to get a decent return means
investing in expensive hardware, hoping to make enough to cover your electricity bills and air-conditioning.
Of course, I could be wrong, but that's the impression I get.  I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but then there's the matter of the dedicated hardware or the ASICs to purchase...

Would this be the same one that could use crypto as well?  I never did investigate because it wanted a Windoze box, but Sandisk rings a bell.

Unless you're thinking of USB sticks specifically, I've got several USB devices that can have their firmware upgraded.  My GPS receiver, my ADSL modem, my external disk, and for all I know my printer.  Probably the mobile phone as well.

That *could* be it; I'd heard a few different versions of the story that some copiers would not do currency, and naturally the banks themselves are going to be less than forthcoming about their techniques (just like in the crypto world).
Personally, I was baffled about copiers refusing to print greenbacks; aren't they all the same colour anyway?  I can just imagine the algorithm:
    if hue_is_greenback
    then
    fi
against which the obvious attack is of course:
    vary_hue_until_success
Sorry for my horrible pseudo-code...

The version I'd heard was that should they recognise (American?) currency then they wouldn't print at all, or was that copiers?
Of course, colour printers were expensive in those days, and now they're practically given away (and money is made on the consumables).

I think they start targeting the corporate servers, too, to drive the point home to the suits.
More power to 'em...  If it wasn't for DNSBLs, email would not be possible (something the frea speach frothers seem to overlook).

Unless your meaning of "boots from flash memories" differs from mine, then I don't.
My Mac has a real disk.  My FreeBSD server has a real disk.  My Debian lapdog has a real disk.  The only outsider is my ancient EeePC-701, which I haven't switched on for ages (and even then, it ran M0n0wall).
Heck, even my old CP/M stuff uses floppy...
Of course, if you're going to argue that an EPROM/EEPROM/etc (or even a diode matrix, or on the CDC series a switch panel) then that's a different Please don't make bald assertions such as "Everyone does this" or "Nobody does that", otherwise you will be demonstrably incorrect.

How would you arrange them, then?  I seem to recall that Enigma was broken largely due to sloppy user practices e.g. weak message key, re-use of keys, repeating same message with a weaker scheme, etc.  Used properly, Enigma would've been unbreakable at the time.
