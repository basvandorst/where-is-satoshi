Attn.: Sir/Madam,
 I am Senator Ben Musa,
Chairman senate committee on petroleum federal
republic of Nigeria.
My colleagues and I just concluded a crude oil
business here at the bonny terminal that worth $15
Million dollars. As government officials, it is
dangerous for us to keep this amount of money here
because, if the government knows about this it will
cause a lot of problems for us. We have arranged to
move the $15 Million dollars out of Nigeria under
diplomatic cover abroad to a foreigner who is willing

If you’re able to handle this transaction, respond
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
20% of the total amount, 75% will be for me and
colleagues while 5% will be for any expenses both

I look forward to receiving your quick respond.
Best Regards,
Sen.Ben Musa
