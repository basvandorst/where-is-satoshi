A general purpose cloud VM where an attacker has a chance to run his VM
on the same underlying hardware may be more problematic. But also harder
to fix with a DIY USB device....

With hindsight, it was definitely a mistake. The questions are whether
they could or should
have known it was a mistake at the time and whether the NSA played any
part in the mistake,
and whether they should have warned users and changed the default well
before now.

Well yes, for most browsers and servers it's "pick a suite - sorry, we =
haven't added AES-GCM yet, you have a choice of one flawed stream cipher =
or a load of block ciphers all in flawed MAC-then-Encrypt mode".
I wasn't suggesting that this choice is a huge benefit over picking One =
True Suite, just commenting on how Firefox comes to pick Camellia.
(The supposed agility does mean that when people get round to
implementing TLS 1.2 and AES-GCM, or if Salsa20 gets added, it can be
used without having to define a new One True Suite. But that only helps
if new suites actually get adopted before attacks are found on all the
old ones. And if an attacker can't easily force a downgrade to SSL3.0
without the user being warned....)

Surely that's precisely because they (and SSL/TLS generally) _don't_
have a One True Suite, they have a "pick a suite, any suite" approach?
Weird/vanity/local ciphers are "preferred" in the sense that NSS
assumes that if you put a cipher that no-one normal uses in your
list of acceptable ciphers, you probably really wanted to use it.
So when servers and browsers that aren't required to use it by the
Japanese government include it just because it's lying around
and why not, it gets chosen over AES for no particular reason.
But that's not the same as making it part of the One True Suite.

It doesn't mean the approach is useless though. Even if you have a weak
session key (based on, say, clock time, a serial number, and a "secret"
shared by all devices of this class, input to a KDF), an attacker can
find the key, but not trivially, and they have to use it to attack
perhaps just one message where the long term private key is provisioned.
That's in some ways better than generating a weak long term
private key. (But maybe worse if it gives you a false sense of
On the other hand, having one device with well-audited RNG with real
physical randomness, and well-audited key generation, provisioning lots
of products whose PRNGs you aren't too sure of even when seeded with
that un-intercepted local traffic, might have some value.

Given that we're assuming the device can't reliably generate a secure key pair,
and assuming that it doesn't already have a secret specific to the device, what
protocols would be suitable for doing that?
(And if we can ask a device to generate keys and securely migrate them to us,
we can ask it to generate some random seed material that isn't visible to an
attacker, which solves the problem of local generation.)
