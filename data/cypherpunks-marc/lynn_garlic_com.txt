typically certificates have had two characteristics .... 1) asn.1 encoding for network interoperability distribution and 2) trusted third party binding of some information to the public key
self-signed certificate caching is really loading public key into a locally maintained table.
in principal there is no need to maintain asn.1 encoding format in a locally maintained table since it eliminates having to decode it on every use .... and the asn.1 encoding is only useful if you 1) are planning on redistributing somebody else's public key and 2) need the original bit format for validating the self-signed signature. The validating of the self-signed signature can be done on initially acquiring the certificate .... and then it can be decoded, and the decoded values loaded into the table. the table/database just becomes entries of public keys and the associated attributes (which might be a combination of the original plus any additional that you might want to add along the way).
in that sense it becomes more of authentication management .... along the lines of kerberos, radius, and/or the AAA RFCs, aka authentication,  authorization, and accounting.
in previous posts about BBB, it is possible that it would be used in combination with online trusted references .... i.e. analogous to real-time call to BBB and obtaining referrels and any complaint information ... and then possibly remembering it by recording it in the table (aka online trust propogation as opposed to the offline trust propogation represented by TTP Part of the issue with the offline TTP stale, static certificate model was that it periodically tried to overload the contents of the certificate .... trying to justify the expense of the ceritifcate to the public key owner .... but having little or no idea what might be the future requirements  of a broad range of relying parties. A locally maintained relying-party table/database would allow the relying party to dynamically adapt the trust characteristics that they were interested in.
Decoding the self-signed certificate before loading into the local table .... helps highlight that the recorded trust characteristics don't have to be restricted to just those that happen to exist in the stale, static certificate (created at some time in the past by entities that had no anticipation regarding your specific trust requirements).

we sort of tried that ... however the financial justification sort of fell apart. the big thing about BBB is being able to trust some merchant that you have absolutely no knowledge about. However, the actual buying patterns are extremely skewed ... with well over 80 percent of the transactions either repeat or with some organization that there is other avenues of trust propagation .... and involving a very small number of very large merchants.  The BBB model tends to work with higher value, infrequent transaction. The remaining online, merchant market segment not covered via other trust processes, tended to represent a small percentage of total transactions, spread over a very large population of very small merchants, and frequently low value.
eBay is an attempt to provide an alternative delivery for such market segment .... and the issue is how does eBay operations break even financially on a BBB like offering.

"real" authentication is actually that hard; it is "identification" that tends to really get sticky. one of the reasons for simplified security taxonomy like PAIN or PAIIN ... aka
3-factor authentication is
something you have (like a token)
something you know (like password)
something you are (like biometrics)
In the past, I've posted regarding proposals for implementing authentication techniques in association with various internet operation registries .... in part because they are currently relying primarily on identification which is easily spoofed.
the previous posts highlight the domain name take-over exploits .... using the same techniques used in the referenced article for ip-address take-over.
the issue for SSL domain name certificates .... and people concerned about the integrity of the domain name infrastructure .... is that the certification authorities aren't the authoritative reference for the information that they are certifying .... it is the domain name infrastructure (and similarly the ip-address registry). The domain name take-overs have been very similar to the described techniques in the article for ip-address take-over. Somewhat the CA industry proposal is for the registries to implement public key registration at the same time the domain name (or ip-address) is registered.  The public key is registered in the registry account record .... and all future interaction is done via authenticated signed transactions (authenticated using the public key in the registry account record).
The claim regarding the operation of the internet operational registries is that they are effectively non-authenticated .... in much the same way that current credit card transactions are not authenticated. The x9.59 standard is for all electronic retail payments and are authenticated using a public key registered in the account record. This is effectively the some proposal (somewhat instigated by the certification authority industry) for transitioning the internet registries from non-authenticated transactions to authenticated transactions (by using digitally signed messages that are authenticated with public key registered in the corresponding registry account record).
as in previous observations .... having a domain name owner register their public key in the internet registry (domain name infrastructure or ip-address registery) starts to lesson the requirement for having SSL domain certificates.

the equiivalent for an online, internet paradigm (as opposed to something left over from the offline email genre of at least 10--15 years earlier) was that the browswer tab;e pf trusted entities were of online authorities (as opposed to certificate manufacturing) and if you cared, you clicked thru to the BBB and got realtime information about the merchant in question (being equivalent to when people call the BBB to actually get some level of real input .... as opposed to just a fuzzy comfort fealing).

that is why we coined the term merchant "comfort" certificates some time ago. my wife and I having done early work for payment gateway with small client/server startup in menlo park ... that had this thing called SSL/HTTPS ... and then having to perform due diligence on the major issuers of certificates .... we recognized 1) vulnerabilities in the certificate process and 2) information hiding of transaction in flight only addressed a very small portion of the vulnerabilities and exploits.
lots of past discussions related to our use of merchant comfort certificates from the past:
we concluded that a real issue is that way too much of the infrastructure is based on shared-secrets and there was no realistic way of providing blanket protection to all the exposures and vulnerabilities of such shared-secret infrastructures. somewhat related discussion in the security proportional to risk posting:
so rather than trying to create a very thick blanket of encryption covering the whole planet .... a synergistic approach was attempting to provide alternatives to as much of the shared-secret paradigm as possible. As in the referenced post:
 authentication white paper
strong encryption of identification and privacy (and shared-secret) information is good ... but not having identification, privacy and shared-secret information is even better.
there are all sorts of ways of obtaining shared-secret information (and/or privacy and identification information prelude to identity theft) .... including various kinds of social engineering.
as previously mentioned requirement for X9.59 standard was to preserve the integrity of the financial infrastructure for ALL electronic retail payments. As per previous notes, X9.59 with strong authentication eliminates the account number as a shared-secret as well as eliminating requirements for name, address, zip-code, etc as part of any credit card authentication process (strong encryption of vulnerable information is good, not having the information at all is even better).
ALL in addition to referring to things like credit cards, debit cards, atm transactions, stored-value transaction, over the internet, at point-of-sale, face-to-face, automated machines, etc .... also refers to ACH transactions. ACH information allows for unauthenticated push or pull transactions. Social engineering requesting bank account information so somebody can push tens of millions into your account also allows for them to generate a pull transaction removing all the money from your account.

in a world where there are repeated human mistakes/failures .... at some point it is recognized that people aren't perfect and the design is changed to accommodate peoples foibles. in some respects that is what helmets, seat belts, and air bags have been about.
in the past systems have designed long, complicated passwords that are hard to remember and must be changed every month. that almost worked when i person had to deal with a single shared-secret. when it became a fact of life that a person might have tens of such different interfaces it became impossible. It wasn't the fault of any specific institution, it was a failure of humans being able to deal with large numbers of extremely complex, frequently changing passwords. Because of known human foibles, it might be a good idea to start shifting from an infrastructure with large numbers of shared-secrets to a non-shared-secret paradigm.
at a recent cybersecurity conference, somebody made the statement that (of the current outsider, internet exploits, approximately 1/3rd are buffer overflows, 1/3rd are network traffic containing virus that infects a machine because of automatic scripting, and 1/3 are social engineering (convince somebody to divulge information). As far as I know, evesdropping on network traffic  doesn't even show as a blip on the radar screen.
In the following thread on a financial  authentication white paper:
 Authentication white paper
 FINREAD was. Authentication white paper
 FINREAD ... and as an aside
 FINREAD was. Authentication white paper
there is point made that X9.59 standard doesn't directly address the Privacy aspect of security (i.e. no encryption or hiding of data). However, the point is made that it changes the paradigm so that the financial account number no longer represents a shared-secret and that it can be supported with two-factor authentication  i.e. "something you have" token and "something you know" PIN. The "something you know" PIN is used to enable the token, but is not a shared secret. Furthermore, strong authentication can be justification for eliminating the need for name or other identification information in the transaction.
However, if X9.59 strong authentication is used with two-factor authentication and no identification information is necessary .... then it would make people more suspicious if privacy information was requested. Also, since privacy information is no longer sufficient for performing a fraudulent transaction, it might mitigate that kind of social engineering The types of social engineering attacks then become convincing people to insert their hardware token and do really questionable things or mailing somebody their existing hardware token along with the valid pin (possibly as part of an exchange for replacement). The cost/benefit ratio does start to change since there is now much more work on the crooks part for the same or less gain. One could also claim that such activities are just part of child-proofing the environment (even for adults). On the other hand, it could be taken as analogous to designing systems to handle observed failure modes (even when the failures are human and not hardware or software).

the issue in the "yes card" exploit is that you migrate the financial business rules out into hardware tokens (of any kind) and then do peer-to-peer operations between tokens.
the threat model is you attack the belief in a valid hardware token ... once you have that you have the mechanism for creating counterfeit tokens that can convince other tokens that they are valid.

my claim about the paradigm is that during the 80s, there was start of lot of investment by all sorts of parties into smartcards ... targeted for the portable computing market niche ... where the state of the art would allow relatively powerful computing and memory in such chips ... but the technology didn't exist for portable input/output technology .... as a result there also had to be ISO international standards for the input/output stations that would interoperate with the smartcards. that market niche started to disappear in the early 90s with the appearance of portable input/output technology associated with cellphones and PDAs. by this time, at least several billion dollars had been invested in the somewhat to recoup (at least some portion of) the investment, there has been some searching for alternative market niches for the
technology. In the early 90s, my wife and I consulted to some agencies on aspects of this. one such target was emergency medical information .... a person could carry their complete medical records in such a form factor .... and in a life&death emergency .... the emergency crews could pull out the victims card and insert it into their locak, offline, portable display technology and have access to the victims complete medical records. The problem in this scenario was that an emergency first responder isn't likely to be able to make use of the victims medical records in offline manner. First off, if it is a real emergency ... how does a first responder do other than triage. Typically for anything that involves anything more complicated ... the first responder has to go online to "real" doctors at some remote location. If you have a real online environment ... to real (remote) doctors ... then a much better solution is to have something that authenticates the victim ... and the consulting doctor then has some mechanism for locating and retrieving the online medical records (as opposed to first responder being able to make sense out of a victim's complete medical records).
Another niche for the technology was offline financial transactions ... for parts of the world where online connectivity was difficult, non-existent and/or extremely expensive. the smartcard would contain the business rules and logic for performing (offline) financial transaction interacting with random merchant terminals. Two issues arise here .... there is a significant mutual suspicion (lack of trust) problem between random merchant terminals anywhere in the world and random consumer smartcards anywhere in the world; and the technology started to be deployed at a time when online connectivity was starting to become ubiquitous and easily available in most places in the world. An example is the european deployed stored-value (offline) smartcards in the 90s compared to the rapid market penetration of stored-value (online) magstripe (gift, affinity, merchant, etc) cards in the US .... making use of the ubiquitous nature of online connectivity available in the US. Again, which the availability of online .... the problem changes from requiring a very expensive and trusted distributed offline infrastructure and offline distributed business rules  .... to the much more simple problem of requiring (increasingly strong) authentication.
So the financial oriented infrastructure has seen some amount of "skimming" threats and exploits with the terminals and/or networks. Even if the smartcard paradigm is just reduced to a (dumb) chipcard that only provides strong authentication .... the issue is does the consumer completely provide their own environment ... or do they have to depend on (and trust) randomly located terminals at random locations around the world.
Part of the authentication issue ... is the 3-factor authentication model
* something you have
* something you know
* something you are
the "card" (or chip) provides the "something you have" piece.
in order to add "something you know" ... requires the consumer entering a pin or password; the issue then becomes does the consumer trust some randomly located pin-pad. there is a similar issue with whether the consumer trust their own biometric sensor or would they trust somebody else's biometric sensor.
a consumer owned cell phone .... could presumably provide both a consumer trusted pin-pad ... and w/o a whole lot of magic ... a consumer camera cell phone could be used for sensor for various kinds of biometric info.
some part of the issue is that the original target market niche for smartcards (portable computing with fixed interoperable input/output stations) started to evaporate after a lot of the investment had been done but before there was a lot of deployment and investment recovery.

in general, it is "something you have" authentication as opposed to the common shared-secret "something you know" authentication.
while a window of vulnerability does exist (supposedly something that prooves you are in possession of "something you have"), it is orders of magnitude smaller than the shared-secret "something you know" there are two scenarios for shared-secret "something you know" 1) a single shared-secret used across all security domains ... a compromise of the shared-secret has a very wide window of vulnerability plus a potentially very large scope of vulnerability
2) a unique shaerd-secret for each security domain ... which helps limit the scope of a shared-secret compromise. this potentially worked with one or two security domains ... but with the proliferation of the electronic world ... it is possible to have scores of security domains, resulting in scores of unique shared-secrets. scores of unique shared-secrets typically results exceeded human memory capacity with the result that all shared-secrets are recorded someplace; which in turn becomes a new exploit/vulnerability point.
various financial shared-secret exploits are attactive because with modest effort it may be possible to harvest tens of thousands of In one-at-a-time, real-time social engineering, may take compareable effort ... but only yields a single piece of authentication material with a very narrow time-window and the fraud ROI might be several orders of magnitude less.

2) a unique shaerd-secret for each security domain ... which helps limit the scope of a shared-secret compromise. this potentially worked with one or two security domains ... but with the proliferation of the electronic world ... it is possible to have scores of security domains, resulting in scores of unique shared-secrets. scores of unique shared-secrets typically results exceeded human memory capacity with the result that all shared-secrets are recorded someplace; which in turn becomes a new exploit/vulnerability point.
various financial shared-secret exploits are attactive because with modest effort it may be possible to harvest tens of thousands of In one-at-a-time, real-time social engineering, may take compareable effort ... but only yields a single piece of authentication material with a very narrow time-window and the fraud ROI might be several orders of magnitude less. It may appear to still be large risk to individuals ... but for a financial institution, it may be relatively small risk to cover the situation ... compared to criminal being able to compromise 50,000 accounts with compareable effort.
In some presentation there was the comment made that the only thing that they really needed to do is make it more attactive for the criminals to attack somebody else.
It would be preferabale to have a "something you have" authentication resulting in a unique value ... every time the device was used. Then no amount of social engineering could result in getting the victim to give up information that results in compromise. However, even with relatively narrow window of vulnerability ... it still could reduce risk/fraud to financial institutions by several orders of magnitude (compared to existing prevalent shared-secret "something you know" authentication old standby posting about security proportional to risk

the cost of EAL evaluation typically has already been amortized across large number of chips in the smartcard market. the manufactoring costs of such a chip is pretty proportional to the chip size ... and the thing that drives chip size tends to be the amount of eeprom memory.

I also mentioned that two years after i had finished such a design ... that tcpa was starting to converge to something similar. the head of tcpa in the audience quiped that i didn't have a committee of 200 helping me with the design.

unfortunately as far as SSL domain name certificate ... the domain name infrastructure is the
authoritative agency for domain name ownership ... the SSL domain name certification agencies
have to rely on the domain name infrastructure to validate true ownership for SSL domain name
applications. As I've repeatedly referenced ... this puts the CAs in catch22 ... they
need improved integrity of domain name infrastructure (attacks on ownership records of domain
name ownership and then being issued valid SSL certificate) ... which comes with lots of
DNSSEC ... but that also eliminates much of the need for SSL domain certificates.
as per prior reference about original working on SSL for electronic commerce ... at least for
the financial industry I've repeatedly shown that digital certificates were redundant
and superfluous. I also shown that at the time, the addition of digital certificates
increased the payload size by two orders of magnitude (besides being redundant and superfluous).
That apparently motivated the "compressed" digital certificate financial standard effort ...
trying to reduce digital certificates so that the payload bloat was only ten times (instead
of hundred times) ... in large part by eliminating all information that the processing
institution already had. I demonstrated that processing institution would have all
information and therefor digital certificates could be reduced to zero bytes ... so
instead of eliminating redundant and superfluous digital certificates ... it was possible
to mandate that zero byte certificates be appended to every transaction (it would be
possible to digitally "sign" a payment transaction for authentication ... and rely on
the individual's financial institution to have registered the person's public key ... w/o
having to increase the size of every payment transaction in the world by 100 times just
to transmit a redundant and superfluous appended digital certificate).
I like the interchange at panel discussion in early 90s ACM SIGMOD ballroom open session,
somebody in the audience asked what was all this x.5xx stuff about and one of the panelists
said it was a bunch of networking engineers trying to reinvent 1960s database technology.
there was some amount of participation by the information assurance directorate in financial
industry standards meetings. at various times there were references to rifts between IA
and SIGINT ... but for all I know that may be kabuki theater. I was fairly vocal about
any backdoors could put financial industry at risk for bad guys discovering the vulnerabilities
... and wanted KISS applied to as much as possible (and backdoors forbidden)
there are other agendas in much of this. at the start of the century there
were several "safe" internet payment products pitched to major merchants (accounting for 70%
of internet transactions) which got high acceptance. Merchants have been indoctrinated for
decades that a large part of interchange fee is proportional to associated fraud rate ...
and the merchants were expecting an order of magnitude reduction in their fees (with
the safe products). Then came the cognitive dissonance when the banks told the merchants that
rather than major reduction in interchange fees with the "safe" payment products ... there would
effectively be a surcharge added to the highest fee that they were already paying (and all the
safe efforts collapse).
Part of the issue was that the bottom line for large issuing banks was 40%-60% from these
fees and an order of magnitude reduction in those fees would be a big hit to
their bottom line (the size of fees in part justified by fraud rates). The "safe" products
going a long way to eliminating most fraud and commoditizing the payment transaction
business ... which would also lower the bar for entry by competition.

recent post with email discussing PGP-like implementation ... a decade before PGP in financial crypto blog
and then a little later realizing there were 3-kinds of crypto (when I was told I could make as many boxes as I wanted ... but could only sell to a certain gov. agency).
In the late 90s, I worked on crypto chip for financial applications ... I would facetiously talk about taking a $500 mil-spec chip and cost reduce by 2-3 orders of magnitude while making it more secure (final objective was well under a dollar). Part of the objective was also to eliminate all the vulnerabilities that payment chips being done primarily in Europe were prone too. Long winded thread in financial crypto blog
About that time, I was also approached by the transit industry to make the payment chip meet transit turnstyle requirements (while not reducing any security) ... this was a contactless chip being able to do crypto operation in 1/10th sec elapsed time and power profile of contactless transit turnstyle operation.
RSA chips at the time were really large implementing 1024-bit arithmatic requiring enormous power and contact operation to get time in a few seconds. It turns out I could have a AADS chip strawman with ECC that was higher integrity *AND* could meet the transit industry turnstyle contactless power & elapsed time profile. some past references to AADS chip strawman
I was also asked to give presentation at Intel trusted computing ... gone 404 but lives on at wayback machine
one of the problems in the early part of the century was that I wanted to go for higher than EAL4+ evaluation ... but NIST(somebody) pullled the ECC evaluation criteria ... and since ECC was part of the chip silicon ... w/o the ECC evaluation criteria ... I had to settle for EAL4+.
Possibly part of the issue with AADS chip strawman was I approached it as purely a cost issue ... and the objective was to eliminate all possible costs from the whole infrastructure ... the side effect of course, it also eliminated all related profit.

it can be more than inertia ... there can significant financial interests in existing
status quo ... prospect of any significant disruption can be extremely threatening to
those financial interests.
interchange fees (electronic payment transaction fees paid by merchants to financial
institutions) have been heavily prorated for associated fraud rates.
Circa 2000-2001, there were a number of internet "safe payment" products pitched to the
major ecommerce operations (accounting for something like 70-80% of transactions)
which saw high acceptance ... they were anticipating something like 90% reduction
in the interchange fees they were paying (merchants have been indoctrinated for
decades about interchange fees heavily prorated by associated fraud rates ... with
internet originally falling into CNP/MOTO category).
Then the cognitive dissonance sets in ... the merchants were told that use of "safe
payment" products ... rather than 90% reduction in the interchange fees, there
would effectively be a surcharge on top of the highest rate they were already paying
.... and they all collapse.
2006 there was followup analysis that payment fees account for less than 10% of
EU financial institution bottom line ... while it runs 40-60% of the bottom line
for US financial institutions ... a 90% hit would be enormous financial disincentive.

it could be any authentication (not just payments) ... and

cost less than typical transit industry chip.
Effort also included making freely available RADIUS and Kerberos code
that would use public key in lieu of password w/o requiring

The CA-industry had a lot of hype about supposed need for branded
CA institution. Note that the financial organization was also being
required to register all the individuals' public keys in the account
records ... before the the 14M account records were conveyed to the
CA, where the bits would be swizzled into a digital certificate for
the small price of $100/account.
Note when the board was told about the $1.4B price, not only was
the effort shutdown (after spending $50M on pilot), but some number
were liberated from their employment.
At the time we had become quite well known for criticizing CAs.
In this case, we pointed out that every case where the CAs were
justifying a digital certificate for verifying a customer's
digital signature, the operation also involved accessing the
account record ... where the public key had been previously
been pre-registered ... as a result, in every case, the digital
signature could be verified by the previously registered public
key in the account record ... and in every case, the digital
certificate was redundant and superfluous (besides being
useless expensive expenditure).
We had also documented, in the case of digital certificates for
payment transactions ... it involved a similar scenario, in every
case the the account record needed to be accessed at some point
(where the public key had been previously registered). Furthermore
in the payment transaction case besides digital certificates being
redundant/superfluous and useless expensive expenditure, they
were also an enormous payload bloat ... digital certificate being
100 times larger than the standard payment transaction size. Somewhat
as a result, the CA industry got a "compressed certificate" work
item added to financial industry standards body. Part of the
"compression" work eliminated any field that would be available
at the relying institution. We then showed that *ALL* fields
would be at the relying institution ... and digital certificates
could be compressed to zero bytes ... rather than eliminate
all use of digital certificates, mandate that zero-byte digital
certificates be attached to every payment transaction (creating

was predicted to have a 10% downside ($200M) ... and we should
stop our vocal criticism.
We then went to some Federal LEOs and were told that investment
bankers were like that.Many of the investment bankers involved
in the internet bubble IPO mill (put in a few tens millions, hype
for couple yrs, IPO for couple billion, and then fail, leaving the field
open for the next round of IPOs), had previous walked away clean from

Older observations. In the mid-to-late 90s, the CA industry was floating
a $20B/annum business case around wallstreet ... supposedly the financial industry
would front $100/customer/annum individual digital certificates. That didn't happen,
but they were heavily lobbying gov. to mandate $100/public/annum digital certificate.

a CA-based online financial infrastructure. They had spent $50M on pilot ... but
when they told the board that the CA was asking that they send them 14M account

We were then brought in to help wordsmith the California electronic signature
