Global controls will have to be imposed
And a world governing body will be created to enforce them
Crises, precipitate change
[Secretly, plotting your demise]
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environments
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash the whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I want to make a super virus
Strong enough to cause blackouts in every single metropolis
'Cause they don't want to unify us
So fuck it, total anarchy
And can't nobody stop us
You see late in the evening
Fucked up on my computer and my mind starts roaming
I create like a heathen
The first cycles of this virus I can send through a modem
Infiltration hits your station
No Microsoft or enhanced DOS will impede
Society thinks they're safe when
Bingo! Hard drive crashes from the rending
A lot of hackers tried viruses before
Vaporize your text like so much white out
I want it where file replication is a chore
Lights out, shut down entire White House
I don't want just a bug that could be corrected
I'm erecting immaculate design
Break the nation down section by section
Even to the greatest minds it's impossible to find
I want to devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environments
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash the whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
"We have already planned
The plan is programmed into every one of my thousand rrrobots
We will not hesitate; we will destroy; the Homo sapien
Please, stay where you are"
I wanna develop a super virus
Better by far than that old Y2K
This is 3030 the time of global unification
Break right through they
Terminals, burn 'em all
Slaves to silicon
Corrupt politicians with leaders and their keywords
FBI and spies stealin' bombs
Decipitate their plans in their face and catch the fever
Everybody loot the stores, get your canned goods
Even space stations are having a hard time
Peace keepers seek to take our manhood
Which results in the form of global apartheid
Ghettos are trash dumps with gas pumps
Exploded and burnt out since before the great union
The last punks walk around like masked monks
Ready to manipulate the database or break through 'em
Human rights come in a hundredth place
Mass production has always been number one
New Earth has become a repugnant place
So it's time to spread the fear, the fun, the sun
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environments
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash the whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
