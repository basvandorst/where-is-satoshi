@_subject: Link exchange request 
I am the volunteer administrator for the Acne Resource Center, an informational resource all about Acne; how it develops and what can be done about it. I am writing you because we are looking to exchange links with other health related websites.
If you will link to the Acne Resource Center, located at  then I will place a reciprocal link on our links page. Just let me know where you want your link to appear by getting back to me with where your link is located and where you want yours to appear. Also, if you have a short byline for your site, I would be more than happy to add that as well.
A sample byline for the Acne Resource Center would be:
Explore the Acne Resource Center for hundreds of articles on acne, including research on acne, an in-depth look at the different kinds of acne and how to cope with the emotional effects of acne.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.
Kind regards,
Travis Whitley
