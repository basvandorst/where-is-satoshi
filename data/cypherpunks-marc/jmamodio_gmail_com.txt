Didn't took long for Wired to include the "cyberatack" theme on their
recent related article.

wikileaks. seems that they (wikileaks) got the message, following
tweets included their IP address and the new .ch domain.
The current IP address for the cablegate stuff is 213.251.145.96 which
is RIPE block assigned to wikileaks, the RIPE WHOIS entry shows
213.251.128.0/18 with AS16276 as originwhois AS16276 (OVH in Paris
France), mtr from here (SATX) seems to go through Dallas and enter
Global Crossing network or hosting services, currently <2% packet
Server seems to be configured to return IP address based URLs.

I'll just point to an article I found very interesting about this matter:
Aren't we being part of some kind of action-reaction game to produce
systematic changes as side effects ?

Instead of tweeting about how to reach their content, or their IP
addresses to bypass DNS, they are sending repetedly via twitter the
following URL

Hardly, IMHO it is a gambit to ask for money.
Craig, don't you guys at Arbor have the IP addresses that were
tracking for the DDOS attacks ?

Sort of weird theory, but it sounds really strange that knowing the
kind of reactions that one could expect due the content being
published in the site that they have such a naive dns setup for that
given domain.
Unless what you are looking for is actually getting booted so you can
cry loud (which they already did via twitter few mins ago), "hey the
US killed our domain".
BTW, the domain still shows in the PIR WHOIS.

Everydns says on their page:
"EveryDNS.net provided domain name system (DNS) services to the
wikileaks.org domain name until 10PM EST, December 2, 2010, when such
services were terminated. As with other users of the EveryDNS.net
network, this service was provided for free. The termination of
services was effected pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
EveryDNS.net Acceptable Use Policy.
More specifically, the services were terminated for violation of the
provision which states that "Member shall not interfere with another
Member's use and enjoyment of the Service or another entity's use and
enjoyment of similar services." The interference at issues arises from
the fact that wikileaks.org has become the target of multiple
distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. These attacks have, and
future attacks would, threaten the stability of the EveryDNS.net
infrastructure, which enables access to almost 500,000 other websites.
Thus, last night, at approximately 10PM EST, December 1, 2010 a 24
hour termination notification email was sent to the email address
associated with the wikileaks.org account. In addition to this email,
notices were sent to Wikileaks via Twitter and the chat function
available through the wikileaks.org website. Any downtime of the
wikileaks.org website has resulted from its failure to use another
hosted DNS service provider."

shows gone for me too . btw, excuse the blunt, but for an organization
like this kind of extremely stupid to have all the secondaries with
the same provider no ?

If you get a court order I guess you have two choices, one is to
comply with it and the other get used to wear a nice pair of matching
bracelets until your attorney shows up.

We have to do the right thing anyway because as engineers we are always
motivated to innovate, to fix, to make things better. Motivation has not to
come form the NSA or any other spooking service of the day. Even if we
design and deploy the best engineering solution there is always a weak link
that can be compromised, coerced by law or workaround by
We want better was to provide "privacy" ? I'm not against that, but if you
really want privacy the best and cheapest engineering solution is to remove
the plug.
We should spend more cycles about how to make broadband real broadband,
deploying IPv6, implementing DNSSEC, educating people and bringing Internet
where is no access or where there is bad access make it good, if in the
process of doing that the NSA wants to get high sniffing all packets I
really don't care much because that is not an engineering problem.
I think that "privacy" on a "public" network is a very relative concept,
same as "security".

I read all of it, the original article and other references to it.
IMHO, there is no amount of engineering that can fix stupid people doing
stupid things on both sides of the stupid lines.
By trying to fix what is perceived an engineering issue (seems that China
doing the same or worse for many years wasn't an engineering problem) the
only result you will obtain is a budget increase on the counter-engineering
efforts, that may represent a big chunk of money that can be used in more
effective ways where it is really needed.
