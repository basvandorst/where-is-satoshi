Likewise, my apologies for being so irritable. You post arrived at the
end of a very bad week...
Your arguments would have been better received if you referred to a published or forthcoming paper which included the supporting cost estimates. It is frustrating to hear news that XXX may be insecure without the necessary information to allow oneself to form an opinion.
We get this all the time - usually it is skript kiddies who have some supposed sshd exploit :)
As Kevin mentioned, the next release places a lower bound of 768 bits on
the size of RSA keys we will accept. We have a natural aversion to adding more config options (more options == more bugs), but I'm sure if evidence
came out that key sizes < x bits were insecure we would either up the limit, or make an option.

I am disputing that the improvements as presented are practically
relevant. Since you saw fit to cross-post to openssh-unix-dev which
is a list concerned with code (not polemic), that is the context in
which I chose to frame my reply.
You offer this aside in the context of an argument against the
insufficiency of 1024 bit RSA keys. Surely you don't expect people to
believe that you weren't including it to bolster your argument?
Wow, you go from poorly-supported rant to ad-hominem in no time. No
doubt you will retort by labeling me as one of those "captive security
consultants" that you included in your little dissent-squashing
You post is hyperbole because it is very long on verbiage and very
short on justification. Large claims require a good amount of proof:
If you expect everyone to switch to 2048 bit keys on the basis of your
rant alone, you may be disappointed.
Please get back to us when such research is published. Until then,
I'll treat you argument with the credence that it deserves.
The irony is amusing: you write a five line mess of ambiguity and then
accuse me of a lack of grammar skills.
As a general note, you find that people are willing to give much more
attention to your arguments when they are backed up with facts or
solid analysis (rather than carefully constructed rhetoric) and don't
come with 50kb of crap on the end.

What incremental improvements? Bernstein is the first to point out that
his improvement is asymptotic to key length. Can you offer evidence to the
DES-56 can be cracked in less than a day, which does little to diminish 3DES' standing as a good, conservative cipher. Can you offer any analysis to back up this hyperbole?
Furthermore, your paragraph could easily be misinterpreted to read that Schneier was stating that a 1024 bit RSA cracker is feasible. In fact,
he states pretty much the opposite - that Bernstein's result has little
effect on keysizes in regular use.
