If you're using virtual hosts, remember tha tyou have *2* error_logs to
look in, one for the vhost, and the "master" log for the server,
defined outside the vhost definitions in the config file.

I thought it was a 5E and a 4E.
I heard the 4E stayed online *past* 1400, talking to its fiber neighbors...

Correct: a decision each person must make for themselves...
which is why it was *not* the topic of my inquiry.
I was just curious as to whether people had given any thought to *whether
and how* they could do it, if they decided it was necessary.

An armed FBI special agent shows up at your facility and tells your ranking
manager to "shut down the Internet".
What do you do when you get home to put it back on the air -- let's say email
as a base service, since it is -- do you have the gear laying around, and how
long would it take?
Do you have out-of-band communications (let's say phone numbers) for enough
remote contacts?

I believe we're all conflating 2 separate and, really, disparate things:
1) what does the law actually require and is that realistic?
2) how were MU actually behaving, and does that relieve The Law of cutting
them any slack?
The former isn't really affected by the latter; it can still be unreasonable,
even if that is *not* the reason why MU proper won't be getting cut any slack which might exist.

That appears to be the case at this time, based on things which are hearsay
to we the public, and should not have been released.
But "has a substantially non-infringing use" is, if not a defense, a fact
which should have made them *much* more careful in how they did the take down, a response which is all of a piece with our objections to SOPA.

I'm not sure this is actually true.  The Law generally recognizes 'accident'
as a means for relieving people of responsibility for criminal acts -- it
can't *be* a criminal act without scienter on the part of the doer.
In this case, the doer was negligent, rather than purposefully malicious,
but we have solutions for that as well.
I hope that we don't see a class-action lawsuit against the feds... I wanna
see them have to defend each case individually.

Nope; I agree with the amusingly psuedonymmed "Administrator" who posted
immediately before you: the possibility exists that there's a copy of that file uploaded legally because some other client of the site has the right
to do so... and if you delete the underlying file, you're then screwing over
that other paying customer who isn't breaking the law.
Is everyone beginning to see how "legislators and LEOs who simply don't understand the playing field" are a critically dangerous condition, here?
This is precisely the grounds on which we opposed SOPA.

The *act of making the copy (available)* may be contrary to law (and whether
the law should make this particular category of copyright infringement a
criminal offense, rather than the civil one it's been for over a century is
a completely different topic :-)...
but whether the *contents of the file themselves* contravene some law is,
I think, the issue that Mark was talking about, and clearly we all agree,
a copy of Gigli, while a crime against nature, is not inherently criminal,
in the way that a Traci Lords film is.

The hell it is: cops sieze things which are not only not related to a crime, but cannot *possibly be* relevant to that crime *all the effing time*, Patrick.

Well, pursuant to the "mere conduit" defense, I believe (IANAL) a defensible
case could be made that the (people operating) Tor nodes are not "servers" as
that term is generally understood in the industry, in the same way that web
browser/caches are not "copies" as IP law understands *that* term.

So true, Randy.
But I think the underlying point here was more "when you do these things

type, not merely in degree".
