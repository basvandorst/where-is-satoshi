Truecrypt is a open source software therefore NSA doesn't have back door
access to this particular software. Private encryption software that isn't
being done by open source community, NSA is more than likely to have a back
door access for easy access. Disgusting, is it not? No hard work required.
Anyone can do it K-12.

That's what I thought; if the FBI is guilty of selling the cocaine, then
they got away with it? They're using DPR's employee to initiate drug
1) DPR is not a drug facilitator. He merely host the website for people to
use it.
2) Host wasn't located in the US; therefore US has no jurisdiction over it;
they're not the world police that they're trying so hard to achieve with
that so called "treaties."
3) Yes, DPR may have leaked his email and other identities. However, using
a static IP address is one big rookie fuck-up. However, how did FBI managed
to link DPR to SR? I bet it was from his employee. Also, how did FBI
managed to snag one of his employees? That's my question.
If I were to host a site like SR; I would do it on my own. Trust no one. If
you need to hire someone, get it from a reliable source and must not know
each other - a stranger. Of course, any secret agent could be a stranger
for all we know. It wouldn't matter because the administrator wouldn't leak
his identity. USE BITCOINS AT ALL TIME FOR ANONYMOUS PAYMENT! Use cash or
moneypak to get bitcoins. Never use Western Union, PayPal, or any other
sites that would reveal your ID to the LE. Use bitmessages for secure
communication - it's not in a perfect stage, but it's way better than gmail
in terms of security.
As for VPN, I know several VPN doesn't keep logs at all regardless if they
were subpoenaed or not. And of course, IP is not always static which is a
good thing. And most of the virtual server is located outside of US. When
paying for service, they only accept bitcoin that couldn't be traced back
to me which is a good thing. Of course, USE FAKE EMAIL, and use a different
PGP is grievously important! As long your message is encrypted with > 1024
bit then you're secured! Use 20-50 length, randomly generated password.
Lastly, do not involve "business-sense" to the public that would lead to
SR. There's nothing to brag about except prison. Covert behavior is the
best form of evasion you could ever get. The downside is that NO ONE KNOWS
WHO YOU ARE. And you're not popular except your well known aliases. That's
the beauty of operating underground. Mr. Ulrich is one big rookie fuck-up
and he's paying for it. I am sure he will get a good lawyer, no.. wait, he
got a public defender? Yeah, even if he has tons of money in his bitcoin
account, he would retire by the time he's done with prison, outside of the
USA. Oh yeah, count on that.

Yeah, but the country doesn't have the release the log to the fascist
police state just because "Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty" is in place.
They have the MORAL obligation to disregard the treaty. US is in no
position to demand obligations from other countries. Rather, MLAT is a

Was the VPN located in the US? If not, then FBI doesn't have any
jurisdiction outside of US.

No, it was a rookie fuck-up that enabled old-fashioned detective work. if
it wasn't a fookie fuck-up, then none of this would have happened.

There are rumors that LE arrested the wrong "DPR" guy, as a security
precaution. Just read it over at reddit:
My two cents.
