at the risk of being accused of being humor impaired:
the particles are ignorant.  it's the police officers that need to
know to look for the taggants.  civilians could look, but might not
have access to the semantic content in the database.
this is similar, i think to the taggants that are imbedded in industrial
explosives to indicate the explosive batch number (to try to trace the
pre-bang chain of custody).
google for taggants if this interests you particularly.
