I think it would be easier to provide drivers with a simpler method of
turning off their transponder. Recently ordered FasTrak tokens come with a
mylar bag for this purpose, which is too unwieldy. A switch, however,
might be enough.
This would not prevent an adversary from recording the IDs of cars that
pass through toll gates. It would, however, prevent reading those IDs at
other times.
