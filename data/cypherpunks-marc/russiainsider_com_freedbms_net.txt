** Sweden Was a Military Giant - Until It Invaded Russia
by Michael Peck on Sat, Oct 22, 2016
When most people think of Sweden, they think of IKEA furniture,
depressing murder mysteries and a foreign policy of strict
neutrality.Yet 400 years ago, Sweden was a major military power. Indeed,
it was even an empire, a fact that must make today's Swedish leftists
cringe.Under young King Gustavus Adolphus, a brilliant and innovative
military commander, Sweden in the early 1600s became a sort of Nordic
Israel (which must also make Swedish leftists cringe). Sweden was a
poor, thinly populated nation that couldn't match the resources of
larger rivals such as France and Russia.

The Spiegel interviews Sergey Karaganov, Putinâs foreign policy advisor
"American politicians have openly said that [anti Russian] sanctions are
aimed at bringing about regime change in Russia"
"Russia will never again fight on its own territory"
SPIEGEL: In papers issued by your council, terms like national dignity,
courage and honor often appear. Are those political categories?
Karaganov: They are essential Russian values. In Putinâs world, and in
mine, it is inconceivable that women be harassed and raped in public.
SPIEGEL: Are you referring to the sexual assaults that took place in
Cologne on New Yearâs Eve?
Karaganov: If men were to do something like that in Russia, they would
be killed.

This article is quite insightful, for example, it quotes from the USA
State Department's Directory of Policy Planning in 1948, finding clear
foundations for the behaviour of the USA since, which includes this
summary worthy snippet:
   "We should cease to talk about vague â and for the Far East â unreal
   objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards,
   and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have

Here's what "state-controlled Russian media" looks like. Dimitri
Kiselyov is one of the most watched and trusted TV journalists in
Russia. He hosts a program on Sundays, "Vesti Nedeli" ("News of the
week"). Kiselyov covers events in a very direct and non-nonsense style,
and has a way of making the viewer feel he is speaking directly to him.
His analyses are intelligent and usually quite accurate - if frequently
politically incorrect by western standards.In fact, so powerful and
effective are Kiselyov's reports that the flustered British Bull***t
Corporation (BBC) awarded him the monikers "Russia's spin doctor" and
"chief propagandist."

He was called a new Hitler and accused of hatred of Muslims: what else
could cause the President to arrest, even for a few months, the brave
new migration wave from seven Middle Eastern states? Today he singles
out Muslims, tomorrow he will single out Jews, said Jewish newspapers.
Migration is the lifeblood of America, and the Muslim refugees are
welcome to bring more diversity to the US.
Massive demonstrations, generously paid for by this notable Jewish
philanthropist Mr George Soros, shook the States, while judges promptly
banned the banning order. They insisted the orders are anti-Muslim, and
therefore they are anti-constitutional. Somehow the constitution, they
said, promises full equality of immigrants and does not allow to
discriminate between a Muslim and a Christian.
