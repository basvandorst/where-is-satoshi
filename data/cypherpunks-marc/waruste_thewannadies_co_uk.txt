A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband opening the
front door. "Hurry!" she said, "stand in the corner." She quickly rubbed
baby oil all over him and then she dusted him with talcum powder. "Don't
move until I tell you to," she whispered. "Just pretend you're a
statue."What's this, honey?" the husband inquired as he entered the room.
"Oh, it's just a statue," she replied nonchalantly. "The Smiths bought one
for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too." No more was
said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.
Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen
and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk. "Here," he
said to the 'statue', "eat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths'
for three days and nobody offered me as much as a glass of water."
One evening, in the midst of dinner preparation, our 10-year-old daughter
asked, "Mommy, what's puberty?" My wife was rushed at the moment, so she
suggested that Peggy look up the word in the dictionary, after which they
could talk about it.A few minutes later, Peggy returned. Her mother asked
what the dictionary had said. "Puberty means," announced Peggy, "the
earliest age at which a girl is able to bear children.""What do you think of
that?" my wife asked."I'm not sure," Peggy relied. "I've always been able to
bear children. It's adults I can't bear.".
