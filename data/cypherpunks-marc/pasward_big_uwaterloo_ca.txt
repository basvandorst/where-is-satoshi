But it doesn't even matter whether or not you shop around to find a
non-.Net provider.  What matters is whether or not your credit, etc.,
information travels over the .Net system at some point.  You have no
way of knowing that!
A year or so ago there was an article in comp.risks about a web site
that some user felt was insecure, for whatever reason (though not with
respect to the security of the communication).  It gave the option of
'phoning in the order instead of using the browser.  The problem was,
the person at the other end of the 'phone simply entered the data into
the web site.

What makes you believe that you will not be that consumer?

First, this is not an analogy.  It is a counter example, and one of
very few that exist.  Second, it is an incorrect example:
     In Clover v. Snowbird Resort, a resort employee, arguably on
     duty, came over a roadcut and collided into the plaintiff. Utah's
     statute imposes on skiers the risk of hazards inherent to the
     sport, which includes changing weather conditions, impact with
     lift towers, collisions with other skiers, and losing control.
     Nevertheless, the Utah Supreme Court held that Utah's ski act
     requires a case-by-case determination to decide whether any
     particular hazard truly is integral to the sport. In that case,
     the court held that an injury caused by an unnecessary hazard
     that could have been eliminated in the exercise of ordinary care
     is not "inherent" and the skier may recover from the area
     operator.
Other states have similar cases and law.  For example, in Colorado
legislation, it explicitly states: 'The term "inherent dangers and
risks of skiing" does not include the negligence of a ski area
operator ....'  Courts are quite good at distinguishing between
inherent risk of an activity, and the duty of care required by a
ski-area operator.
Then we can look beyond this particular example to other segments of
society.  Auto manufacturers cannot disclaim liability even though
driving on a highway at 60 mph is an inherently risky activity.  Pub
owners cannot disclaim liability for their customers who become
drunk.  Not even MacDonald's can disclaim liability for the hot coffee
it serves in drive-thoughs.
So, why does the software industry, and the software-security segment,
persist in the notion that it can disclaim all liability regardless of
negligent coding behaviour?  Duty of care applies.  Does this mean
perfection?  No.  It never has.  However, it does mean that companies
are liable for the negligence of their employees, and disclaimers of
liability will not protect such companies.

You've neglected "sue for damage due to neglience."  Disclaimer of
liability will not carry weight if the PKI vendor is negligent in
their design/implementation.  (Note, I am not saying that proving this
in court would be trivial.)

I am not arguing that there are not gray areas, nor that activities
never incur risk.  I am simply arguing that a disclaimer of liability
for the performance of a product will not cover negligence.

Do you mean "why should," or "why shouldn't?"  If the latter, then,
sure, I believe it should.  People running around in business selling
products and services and then disclaiming any liability with regard
to their performance _for_their_intended_task_ is, IMHO, wrong.

If an automaker disclaimed liability for a vehicle, and a negligent
design or manufacture resulted in injury or loss, it is my
understanding that the liability disclaimer notwithstanding, the
automaker would be held responsible.  Why do we believe that the same
would not be the case for software?
