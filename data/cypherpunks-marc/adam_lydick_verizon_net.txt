That is certainly a good point but don't confuse the "nexus" with NCAs
(agents). I think the nexus just provides services to the NCAs which
actually do the work. Think of it as a core library that services can
draw on.
So having to trust the nexus, is rather like trusting kernel32.dll or
some other core components. Choosing to trust/run NCA sounds pretty
grainular, so you can trust your validated P2P stack from your favorite
independent developer and ignore (if you can) the restrictive DRM
solutions that are offered.
Problems certainly remain though:
In the validated P2P scenario, an Adversary with enough influence to
have Intel/AMD/... hand out a signed internal key can circumvent any
such "protections".

The faq (see attached) claims that "anyone can write a nexus" and that
"users control which nexus(s) run".
I certainly didn't see anything that suggests that anyone can force you
to run arbitrary code, regardless of who has signed it. I also find it
absurd to worry about what code Microsoft is running on your system. If
you are running their operating system, you are already running
arbitrary code from them. If you install a security or functional patch,
you are running arbitrary code from them. How would this be different?
My only real concern is that once this becomes widespread, having the
correct "nexus" + DRM software installed will be the only way to get
play digital media. I have a feeling I won't be playing any of that
content from the MythTv box in my living room...
Q: What is the "nexus" component of NGSCB?
A:  The nexus is a new Windows OS component that will be introduced as
part of NGSCB. The nexus, what we used to refer to as a "nub" or
"trusted operating root," is essentially the kernel of an isolated
software stack that runs alongside the existing software stack. The
nexus provides a limited set of APIs and services for applications,
including sealed storage and attestation functions. Think of nexus-aware
applications as residing in the user mode space of the parallel
execution environment and the nexus as residing in the kernel mode
Anyone can write a nexus for use with nexus-aware systems. The user
always has the ultimate authority over what nexuses are allowed to run.
Only one nexus at a time will be able to run on a machine.
Q: What is the privacy model associated with NGSCB?
A: The user is always in control of whether or not nexus-aware
technology is enabled on his or her PC and what nexuses have access to
specific functions. The technology being developed as part of NGSCB
provides a fine-grained access control model that allows users to
specify (by hash) whether an individual nexus has the right to invoke a
specific security operation. In addition, SSC functions that reveal
potentially machine-identifying information, such as the RSA public key,
can only be performed once per SSC reset (and the SSC cannot be reset
from software; you have to power-cycle the PC).

You might find "facecerts" interesting.
This is more for face-to-face checking, however.
For your remote scenario some sort of one-way hash to verify the image
might be intersting. It would have to allow for fuzzy matching after
hashing (for obvious reasons). I think this just raises the bar a tiny
bit though, as an attacker could stalk their victim before stealing
their card to get an idea about what appearance to forge. (or capture
webcam traffic before lifting the card / identity info)

@_subject: curious about covert channels 
Had a random thought and was curious if anyone had an opinion on this:
Would message-ID, and other realated mail headers that contain
pseudo-random data, make a good covert channel?
Eg: instead of choosing a pseudo-random value for the message ID,
encrypt a block of data of the same length as the ID with a preshared
secret key.
Issues that spring to mind:
* small, you would need quite a few overt messages to transfer anything
sizeable over the covert channel.
* Is it possible to tell the difference between pseudo-randomly picked
values (typical mail client), encrypted data (depending on algorithm),
and real randomness? (I suppose this could make the channel detectable)

Interesting idea, but it seems like that would be easy enough to foil.
Why not just put the "inner" characters in a canonical order when
scanning? (searching via google or another strict keyword-based search
engine is another matter) Then you can cheaply match on a single form
regardless of how they have permuted the word. I think the existing
techniques that I've seen on the binaries channels on usenet and some of
the spam I've been getting lately are already more effective. They just
inject noise characters and use creative phonetic spellings.
Maybe reducing the "words" to an improved soundex-like hash would be a
more effective technique for dealing with this issue. Anyone know of any
work in this area? (spell-checker research would probably yield the most
