Is there anything to fight?
The only instance of "digital cash" on google news (there's one
reference to "digital cash registers", which I'm not counting) is an
article about proffr's "x needs killing" comments.  The article doesn't
abuse the term "digital cash", though it does abuse the term "listserv".
The term doesn't appear in print often enough to matter, IMO.

Politics in action... acting president of the Iraqi council is
assassinated; coalition finds "small amounts of" sarin released from an
exploding shell in Iraq.
What's next, we steal all their remaining chemical weapons and bring
them and our military home?
