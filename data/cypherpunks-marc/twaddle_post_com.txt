  Before you         discard this e-mail as Junk, you should read the next few paragrap=
hs         about our impressive rate of return on the featured companies. If =
you         would have been fortunate enough to receive our featured companies=

t to         $8,860 in a span of 12 months (An increase of over 786%).  Ho=
w?         Easy.  Buy when we feature a company, sell when it peaks (usu=
ally         within first sixty days or less) and invest all or part of it into=
 our         next feature. Here is an example of what has happe=
