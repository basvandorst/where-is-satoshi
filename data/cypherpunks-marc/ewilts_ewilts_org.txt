up2date -k The -k option tells up2date to search that directory first for updates.
You'll still contact the RHN servers to get the package list, but if the
updated package is found in your pre-specified directory, it will be
installed from there.

I'm doing this from the top of my head and it's untested, so with that
in mind...
The yum home page is at 1.  Install the yum rpm from
2. You will probably also need tao-release and the tao-yumconf package.
They're in the same directory as the yum package above.
3.  Install all 3 packages.  Remove the protectbase entry from yum.conf
4.  # yum update
Yum won't install anything unless you confirm the operation first so
this should be a safe thing to do.  The first time it runs, it grabs all
the headers just like up2date does.
Since you're grabbing the packages from Tao, you should read up on tao
from   There are mailing lists there too.

You can go to one of the RHEL rebuild sites like Tao, Centos, White Box
Linux, etc.  I think (but haven't tested this) if you set up the yum
updates from something like Tao and edit the yum.conf file to remove the
protectbase variable, you'll clobber the older Red Hat packages with any
newly released Tao packages.  By default, Tao won't overwrite Red Hat
Alternatively, you can go to RHN and pay to renew your subscription...
This is guaranteed to work.
