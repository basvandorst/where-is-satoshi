Just a little phiolosophy to ponder on:
Coflicts are generally of two kinds: one is conflicts for resources
(territory, access to water, etc), the second kind is "religious"
conflicts, caused by one or both sides having a belief incompatible with
other's and including imperative to kill "infidels".
Most conflicts seemingly of of the second kind are in fact conflicts of
the first kind, in disguise (with religious/ideologic rhetoric used to
justify actions).  The ethnic conflicts are never really a standalone
category (ethnicity is commonly and falsely used as a proxy indicator for
person's beliefs or affiliation).
The conflicts of the first kind are usually amenable to resolution by
negotiation, as soon as a commonly acceptable contract framework is found,
and can be effectively prevented by getting standards of living high
enough so that people are contented with what they have.
Conflicts of the second kind cannot be resolved by negotiation.  Simply
because negotiation does not remove the cause of contention - i.e.
incompatibility of beliefs.  The only way to eliminate such conflict for
good is to modify or extinguish the appeal of the idea.  This is done by
slowing down the distribution of that idea or by making posessing the idea
a very clearly poor proposition compared to having the competing idea.
(Note that, by definition, the other party does not _see_ the errors of
their ways; they have to be shown - and nobody changes their viewpoints
willingly without very good reason).
Achieving conversion of the other side to a mindset compatible with our
own requires either physicall killing of all carriers of the idea, or
careful propaganda war, combined with a system of incentives and
So it very much boils down to a pair of things abhorrent to the
libertarian mind - violence or speech control.
Make your choice.

Yes, you do.  The whole point of firewalls is not to let the specifically
defined content in.  I can just as well have an argument that an attempt
to break into your system is a valid form of expression (and, in fact,
that argument was made in courts).
The fact, that this kind of message can be in many cases detected and
prevented automatically does not change the point that you are restricting
free speech (i.e. unlimited exchange of information) to some other
Absolute free speech is an oxymoron.  And so is claiming that hosting a
terrorist website is legal in US or protected by First Amendment.

Hmmm :) Now, are those the same people who set up firewalls?  It's
restricing free speech of crackers, you know?  Where's your williness to
give them "every right to speak"?
You're a hypocrite.
Now, when did slander become a protected speech? Learn laws of your own country _before_ you try to teach the rest of the
world how to live by them.  The right to speak freely assumes the
necessity to bear responsibility for what you said.  In that particular
case there's an unambiguous attempt to incite a major international
conflict by misplacing blame for the heinous crime.  This is a dangerous
form of slander, souring relationships of two large nations; not just
innocent ravings of a deranged.
Now, let me tell you how it looks like from Russia: US is asking for help
in dealing with terrorists, but does not want to curtail it's own support
for terrorists waging a full-blown war on Russia.  This is the message
millons of people there get by the very fact of that site's existance.
Does anyone have questions on why Russia's support for the proposed
anti-terrorist strikes by NATO is lukewarm?

I'm not calling in question their right to publish; what i'm saying that
this crap was going on for years, and nobody cared.
BTW, if you look at the First Ammendment protections closer, they are not
guaranteeing absolute right of free speech.  Learn the American law before
you invoke it to defend your point of view.
I'm tired of absolutists who cannot see that there's no such thing as
absolute good or absolute evil.  Speech can be very dangerous.  This is
a conflict of ideologies, not nations or religions.  What do you think is
ideology - if not speech?  How do you suppress ideology if you let it
spread unhampered?  Violence is bad? Vote for dissolution of police, if you _really_ mean
that. But don't take the "my hands is clean" high moral ground.  It is
_your_ guilt, too, for being lazy to learn what is going on, and failing
to elect a goverment with a clue, not the bumbling idiot with a Texan
accent and vocabulary of a fifteen-years-old.
That site was spreading lies for a long time and is well-known in Russia

by a hundred million people).

Found on a website hosted in US by a US service provider:
  ******************************************************** This is from the inverview with the spokesman of well-known terrorist
Shamil Basaev, known for personally taking hostage hundreds of patients in
a hospital, among other things (the spokesman is Movladi Udugov, the guy
who threatened to drop an airplane on Kremlin).
Hosted by XO Communications - do not bother them, i already alerted their
Guys, why should a North American provider give a place for this
propaganda?  Call FBI, have them trace the connections of whoever pays for
that site.
[If you decide to read the entire article - the "so-called peacemaker"
Boris Nemtsov mentioned there is a prominent pro-Western politican in
Russia, and (used to be, changed his mind after WTC attack) a leading
proponent of negotiations with Chechen militants.  A shining illustration
of what you get for trying to negotiate with terrorists.]
Please, if you host websites, take a closer look at what you are hosting;
you may help to find leads for the investigation.
