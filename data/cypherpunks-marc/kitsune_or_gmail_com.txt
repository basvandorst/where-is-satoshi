True. If you think about it conceptually - that Tor is an extra layer
(or two) on top of the normal Internet, with routers of its own - it
would very likely be subject to many of the pitfalls of normal routing.
And of course, the larger a set of routers gets, the more likely
something's going to go wrong. =:o)

I've heard of a couple cases where it'd have been wise to use Tor to
post videos on YouTube.

Thankfully - based on other quotes in the article - this looks like
it'll fly like a rock.
