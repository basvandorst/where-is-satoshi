After dipping his back tire in the Atlantic Ocean at Montauk       Point, Carney biked to Manhattan on the first day of his journey led by a       police escort.

Another       highlight of his trip was a visit to his hometown of Centerville, Iowa,       which included a day trip to Des Moines with various press interviews.       Upon his arrival in Denver, CO, Chris was met by Wounded Warrior Project       Founder John Melia, recent double amputee SSGT Heath Calhoun, recent       amputee SSGT Ryan Kelly and world-class hand cyclist Steve Ackerman who       rode with him for two days to Colorado Springs and Canon City.
