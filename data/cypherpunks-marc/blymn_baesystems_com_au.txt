According to Roberto Armenteros:
It is the bootable cd image.  From the sounds of it you did not burn
the image to the CD correctly, laying an iso image onto a CD seems to
be something that a lot of CD burner packages make inordinately
difficult for some insane reason.  Check your burner software settings
carefully to make sure the image is being put onto the CD correctly.
The fact that the CD was not readable from windows indicates the image
was not done correctly, you should be able to see the install sets on
the CD from windows.
