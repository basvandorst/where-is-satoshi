Yes, reading is certainly not a bad thing... :)  There just comes a  time for application and I've already read parts of various Ruby  books and of course have a CS background, so the trick now is to  apply it and learn it better in context.  I would love to have  pickaxe sitting beside me while I'm actually working on something  rather than reading for the sake of absorbing, which for me doesn't  work nearly as well.
I completely agree.  I wasn't putting down reading.  I'm always reading
at least two books.  The point I was trying to make was that reading
will help much more if you try to apply the theory and concepts you find
in the book to real life problems.  I can honestly say that the
"Pragmatic Programmer" changed my coding style completely!

Charlie, yes, that's what I'm wanting to do.  Create some small  programs, maybe useful, maybe not, that will immerse me into the  language.  The rubyquiz.com site seems kind of like what I'm talking  about, but I'd like more practical and more well defined exercises,  of course with accompanying solutions.  My problem is that at the  moment I run my own business and time is limited and unfortunately I  am drawing a blank at "small useful programs" that I can develop.  I  do have some larger grandiose ideas, primarily aimed at RoR, so I've  got this gulf separating me from where I am and to where I want to go...
Thanks for the input thus far!
I usually try to find a small tool that I would like to have and then
create it.  You'll learn a lot more by writing code than reading it.

============================== START ==============================
Hi, I'm trying to get started with Ruby, but I don't feel that any of  the current books or material that I've uncovered are really what I  need to get moving at full steam.  I have a background in computer  science and have programmed in C, C++, Java, Perl, VB, Assembly (x86)  and others, however I've been away from real programming (aside from  minor php stints over the last couple years) for about 4 years.
I'd like to get started with ruby, however I really need some small  exercises or projects ranging from basic beginning to intermediate  and advanced as I lack context while reading through material and  tutorials.  My ultimate goal is to master RoR, however I feel that I  would like a foundation built upon understanding ruby before jumping  into frameworks, such as RoR.
Any thoughts or ideas or material available that helps the rubber hit  the road more appropriately for folks like me?
Thanks much & kind regards,
