So, seeing as how this is the case (verified from the Git repo for
those who are interested), I have my doubts about how relevant the
"Control X number of /'s" attack against users of the Tor network is.
 It stands to reason that of all of the /24's that make up a
particular /16, only one IP address in that entire space might be
utilized for a given circuit.  That suggests that an attacker won't
get nearly as much information with this attack as it seems.  It's

Those are all excellent points.  My question is what the implications
of the following are insofar as this analysis is concerned:
How Tor picks nodes out of the set of all known Tor nodes:
How Tor avoids picking sibling nodes when charting a path through the
Tor detecting siblings:
As I understand it, Tor nodes know IP addresses one up and one down in
a circuit.  I haven't read through the Tor codebase in a while (two or
three years), so my question is this: Does Tor apply the same family
avoidance check when picking nodes to avoid routing traffic through,
say, two nodes on the same /16?  In other words, would Tor do this:
192.168.1.23  ->  172.16.23.93  ->  10.0.61.44
..or would this be a possible scenario:
192.168.1.23  ->  172.16.23.93  ->  192.168.88.77

If enough hams (or one sufficiently angry lone ham operator) decide
that this is a problem they'll organize a turkey hunt to triangulate
the operator(s) and politely ask them to stop before the feds get
called in.  The thinking behind this seems to be that the amateur
community has been graciously granted a small portion of the RF
spectrum to experiment with.  People (licensed hams or otherwise) who
do specifically prohibited things within the amateur bands (like
transmitting encrypted traffic or undocumented digital protocols
(which may be indistinguishable from encrypted traffic)) can get some
or all of the amateur band taken away.  A lot of time and effort are
spent every year by ham operators who don't want this, that, or the
other sliver of the amateur band reassigned away from amateur use, and
someone doing something dodgy within those spectra could have
disasterous consequences.
When Project Byzantium was adding amateur radio support for ISC
milestone  these regulations were noted and discussed at length
during initial reasearch.  We also spoke with the ARRL during
development, which expressed similar sentiments about crypto in the
amateur bands (and passing traffic from unlicensed network users over
the amateur band, incidentally).
That would probably fall under jamming, which is definitely against
ham ethics.
The hams I've spoken to seem to, but they also seem to fall into the
camp of "It's on the amateur bands, so if it's something I'd want to
encrypt I'm not going to talk about it while chewing the rag anyway."

I seem to recall a raid on an epilepsy support forum, where various animated images were spammed all over the message threads.  No hard data on the results that I know of.
It sounds a little like the basilisk hacks in _Eclipse Phase_.  Skeptical cat is skeptical.

It's entirely possible that some folks who work at DDG are lurking on this mailing list, so there could be more truth to that than you expect... :D

Print everything to PDF?
Some shell hackery with wget or cURL and pipe through ImageMagick's convert command?

Some AR games are run for fun and not as advertising (White Roses and Whence Comes the Time come immediately to mind).
I suspect that Cicada 3301 is run by some old-time cypherpunks looking for more people who are interested in building and deploying tech and not just posting to a mailing list.  The problems are way too technical for it to be 'just' an ARG.

I've been using Fossil ( in this way for a couple of years on some projects, and it's been very useful.

They already have what amounts to an internal counter-intelligence
unit that occasionally runs mole hunts looking for employees that
leak information on upcoming products or projects to the news media.
I'm kind of surprised they're not doing this already.

It was designed explicitly to be serverless.
I've never tried saving it to WebDAV; it'd be worth a couple of
experiements, I think. I know people who save theirs to Dropbox and then
share public read-only links to same and it seems to do what they want it to.
Twine applications, also.
As I understand Tahoe-LAFS, it's a filesystem, so you should be able to save
it and be done with it.

You could always write your notes in Markdown, which is pretty good for
ad-hoc outlining and notetaking in my experience.  I got in the habit a while
ago and while it looks a little weird it's intuitive.  Plus, if you really
need to you can later render it into HTML, XML, or other document formats with
something lPandoc (
Tiddly does need JavaScript, but it's entirely self-contained (i.e., it's a
self-modifying HTML page; if you access one from a real web server you can't
edit it, you can only view it).  My threat model is such that JavaScript
kept in a file sitting on my desktop while airgapped is fine; yours is yours.

In recent years I've been using Tiddlywiki ( to manage
notes for my projects, and I'm quite taken with it.  I keep them checked into
the appropriate Git repositories so not only are they versioned but they get
pushed to my server along with the code.

You can always turn it off and write stuff down on notecards.  Or install the
stickynote application of your choice.  Failing that, I hear that ~/notes.txt
is traditional...

If the argument that we're all screwed anyway is made in a sufficiently
detailed way, and the technique described can be reasonably implemented by a
sufficiently motivated actor (a single person at the very least)... why
bother responding?  If things are as bad as you say, what's the point?
