This seems to be a misplaced threat model. Once an adversary has physical access to a device sufficient to read a stored random seed, they have other ways to compromise the system.
There may be no one-size-fits-all answer. Providing means to manage a random seed across reboots or provision it for a VM from a hypervisor seem like they could help important corner cases.
