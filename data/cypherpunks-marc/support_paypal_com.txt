@_subject: Security Notice: ***Verify Your PayPal Account*** 
Dear PayPal member, We recently noticed one or more login attempts in to your PayPal account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you. The login attempt was made from: IP address: 172.25.210.66 ISP Host: cache-66.proxy.alf.com
By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, PayPal can not and does not confirm each user's surported identity. Thus, we have established an  verification system to help you evaluate with who you are dealing with. If you are the rightful holder of the account, click on the link below, fill the form and then submit as we will verify your identity.
