actually, botnets are an artifact.  claiming that the tool is the problem
 might be a bit short sighted.  with the evolution of Internet technologies
 (IoT) i suspect botnet-like structures to become much more prevelent and  useful for things other than coordinated attacks.
 just another PoV.

the protocols ability to "route around" failures is an attribute of packet
based protocols.  it has little to do with legal compliance of an order to cease and desist forwarding packets.  end of the day, i guess it boils
down to the question of -civil disobedience-  if the law is unjust, do you comply because it is the law, or do you protest,
at the risk of punishment/death?  hardly a wire-protocol question - no?
