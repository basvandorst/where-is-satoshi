if i and others had followed your advice, african-americans would still
ride in the back of the bus, we would still have atmospheric atomic
testing, and we would probably still be losing american and viet namese
lives in viet nam and those on the streets and campuses of the country who
disagreed with a bunch of now-convicted felons.
you can take your amerika love it or leave it stuff and put it where the
sun don't shine.  nothing is perfect.  america, love it and fix those parts
of it that need it.  and that's what's great about this country.  we can!

so, if the site to which a dns entry points suffers a ddos, everydns
will no longer serve the domain.  i hope they apply this policy even
handedly to all sufferers of ddos.
if not, as a registrar, i guess i can no longer accept registrations
where everydns is the ns delegatee.

local repository good, i.e. the user owns and controls.  others can not

encrypted good, a bit protected from loss of laptop, a 'maid attack',

so they provide tools to indentity resellers.  the folk their software

my point is that it is MY identity.  there are tools, such as 1password,
which enable me to control MY identity and yet have the effect of single

hi etaoin,
i believe that 'single sign on' is a bad deal and dangerous for all, not
just we geeks.  essentially it means that the 'identiry provider' owns
your identity.  i love that they call themselves 'identity providers'
when it is MY fracking identity and they are reselling it.
the 'single sign on' i encourage for the end using human beings i
support is 1password and its ilk.  it provides the user with one sign-on
yet strongly encourages separation of identities and strong passwords
for sites.
add to that, something such as ghostery for your browser, and you have a
small chance of actually preserving your identity and minimizing cross-
site tracking.
