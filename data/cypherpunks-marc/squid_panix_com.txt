It is in fact PGP's tenth anniversary this year.
Not that PGP was the first crypto system.

In the current environment in the USA, that would be, 'XYZ airlines
denied use of US airspace' or 'denied use of anywhere within range of
US airspace.'
The problem with torts to address danger to others is that the potential value of the torts for events such as 0911
is so huge, nobody could afford to pay the damages.   Alas, pre-emptive action to prevent such threats seems resonable.
This resobning should not be used to justify stupid, inept and counter
-productive pre-emtive action, but of course it will.
  "Despite all the rhetoric and mobilization of the police and military,
   the only real act of successfully opposing terrorists occurred when
   civilians took matters into their own hands on the fourth hijacked
   plane on September 11. While our government has failed miserably to
   protect anyone, this foiling of a fourth attack, apparently targeted
   against the White House, shows that our fellow citizens are still our
   best defense." -  [ Various good points about competition and diversity of
  security measures deleted.]

Dynamic sites should not be a problem,
unless they require users to submit forms
before they see the real content.
A google cache of a dynamic site eg omor.com might have something like
'This page Optimized for 216.239.46.66, googlebot(at)googlebot.com,
 using Googlebot/2.1 (+ .

They might store a long number and without a dictionary you
don't know what it means.  It's unlikely that older cards
would use and XMLish annoted data.
eg does
mean it belongs to a 180# 6'2" person born on Feb 28, 1972 ?
How could you tell ?

'The person who typed it just named it that'
Yeah, that's an explanation.
But this is too trivial a metter to care about.

You get totals per nation, per state, per county, per riding,
per precinct, per polling stion and maybe per ballot box.
So there's a need to design the system to have more voters
than ballot boxes to conform to your second law.
