On the whole PKI as used today is fairly useless.  I mean just because
Company A signed/issued me a key doesn't mean I'm a nice guy nor a
legit business.  All it means is I paid money to have another company
sign my key.
What *would* be more useful is a model of web-o-trust.  E.g. you make
up your own key.  Then you import public keys from third-party auditors
you trust.  Overtime the auditors will visit the business and if they
like it they will sign the key. So say you trust auditors A, B and C and I trust auditors B, C and D. Well chances are if company Z is good the will be audited by at least
one of the auditors we have in common.  Unfortunately there is easy corruption in this model so you would have
to keep tabs on your auditor yourself.   However, in this model it
wouldn't cost money [hey everything net-related should cost money
right?] and would actually be meaningful.

I disagree.  That attack is more akin to a "Hi, I'm calling from
{insert bank here} and we need your CC info to update your file."
That doesn't mean credit cards [nor your bank] are flawed.  It means
you're an idiot for giving out the information.
Note that this "attack" doesn't actually exploit the automated side of
things.  It doesn't learn the secret key [password] nor does it decrypt
packets [via https].  The attack is based on you giving out the
secrets, and alas, no crypto can really stop that [unless you stop
letting the users have the secrets].
So your "conclusions" are a bit off.
