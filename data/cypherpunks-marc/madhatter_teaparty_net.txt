============================== START ==============================
Regarding out-of-sequence messages: yes, I'm aware that messages are arriving out-of-sequence again.  This is caused by people posting from addresses other than those by which they are subscribed.  In what I think is fairly standard anti-spam behaviour for 21st Century mailing lists, this one holds (for moderation) posts from apparently-unsubscribed users. For fastest, and therefore sequential, throughput, *please post from the address at which you have subscribed*.
Regarding unsubscriptions: the list engine doesn't deal well with "unsubscribe" requests sent (a) to the full list (b) from an address at which you're not subscribed; I'm not convinced this is the engine's fault. If you want to unsubscribe, there is automated assistance in the headers of every single list message, which most decent mailers will present to you.  Every subscriber also gets a reminder on the first of every month that outlines several other methods for unsubscribing, and in the limiting case, you can ask me.
Regarding the old archives: I'm still working on it.
Although some people have kindly registered alternative domain names, discussion has continued and *noone* has approached me as I requested.  I remain open to an off-list approach, where I will be happy to explain _inter alia_ why I haven't favoured the alternative-domain-name solution. If some kind of proposal for change gets traction you can all expect to read a "please go here to vote"-type post.  Otherwise, I am fed up reading this stuff on-list, and although I accept that there are still some subscribers who have reservations, I also know there's a body of subscribers that agrees with me.
So since it's currently on my server, I will presume to lay down the law a little, for which I beg your collective forgiveness.  I will unsubscribe anyone who restarts the domain name issue.  If you're leaving the list as you do it, I'll ban you from re-subscribing.  Please, *shut up* about the issue on-list.
