I'm actually fairly certain that you need to be present in order for
them to take your blood. And unless you want to replace a door you
will probably open it for them when they come to your home. Warrants
do compel us to act in these situations, but not to give testimony
against ourselves. So the Judge is ordering the defendant to act in
this case, to provide a "key" to access the device, not to say what is
present on the device or how it got there.
