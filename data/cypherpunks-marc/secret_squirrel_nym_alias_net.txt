@_subject: Re: Anarchists Hijack Police Protest 
That's because like a good boy with Nothing to Hide Thus Nothing
To Fear(TM) they asked permission to exercise rights already granted
to them.
The 'Anarchists' just showed up without so much as a by your leave,
and thus did not have to barter away half their (granted) rights in
order to exercise the other half. Since they did not 'work with the
authorities in order to ensure a calm, trouble free event' like the
police did, they did not take the burden of keeping the peace away
from the authorities.
Thus the authorities had to wait for them to 'cause trouble' before
they could stop them carrying banners. The so-called Anarchists did
not cross whatever invisible line was set, be it for making 'noise
pollution', a public disturbance or having their very presence
noticed by the mass media
Jeez, If anyone ever wondered about The Policeman Inside The Policeman...
