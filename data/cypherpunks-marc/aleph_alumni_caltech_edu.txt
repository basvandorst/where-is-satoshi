And yet many Americans do follow them and respect them.  That is what disgusts me.

Well here is another moron.  From Jerry Fallwell's statements, and Pat Robertsons concurrence, I think it is pretty safe to say that we are in just as much danger from christain fundamentalist terrorists as from muslim fundamentalist terrorists.  I fail to see what a conversion would accomplish.  Let alone a forced conversion.  Blech.  Just when I'm feeling proud to be an American, watching the wonderful response of the people in New York, these scum come along and make me ashamed to be an American.
