I'll grant that my response was a bit pedantic: there is no
legitimate reason for such traffic to leave a network.
I imagine you're right, and that any network that detects any
significant amount would be one whose first octet is a common
fourth-octet-of-a-gateway (1, 65, 129, etc).

The Cisco NAC client for Macs, for the purpose of "VLAN change
detection", sends UDP/80 packets to the host's reversed default
gateway (i.e., if the actual gateway is 1.2.3.4, it sends the packets
to 4.3.2.1) once every five seconds.
