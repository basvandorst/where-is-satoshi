In less dire times, certain capabilities have been suspected, as regards
monitoring and wiretapping technology in place for LEAs, etc.  It is often
maintained that any negative proof of their existence, eg. "I said thus
and such over the phone or in a chat room and nobody came to talk to me"
is due to an unwillingness of the agencies to tip their hand as regards
the existence of these technologies.
That is, it isn't worth it to prove you have real-time monitoring over all
telephone traffic just to catch a prankster in peacetime.
Although proving the existence and quality of domestic monitoring
capabilities is not a priority of mine, for those for whom it is, perhaps
now would be the time to start experimenting again.  The fervor with which
LEAs are now searching, and the desire to break open the case is probably
such that the existence of any domestic monitoring technology would be
allowed, indirectly, to become public knowledge.
You would have to be highly motivated, I suspect, as any "interesting
communication" would clearly land you in very hot water.  Further,
information about "small fish" technologies ("I sent a private message
between two of my own clients on EFnet that was intercepted") is far less
useful than big fish technologies ("I sent a weakly encrypted (56bit
symmetric cipher?) message over a point to point connection between two of
my own modems, across the PSTN").
Please note that I do not condone pranks of any kind, so if you do conduct
a test, send the message or communication to yourself.  (note that the
examples above are self to self communications)
On a related note, are there any provisions in the new anti-terror
legislation that would make such self-to-self "interesting" communications
illegal ?

Can someone clarify the definition, in this context, of "smuggling" ?  Does this mean that $10,000 in cash can no longer be taken out of the
country, or does it mean that it can no longer be taken out of the country
in a secretive manner ?
For as long as I have been traveling internationally, I have been required
to declare all cash amounts larger than $10,000.  Does this mean that
previously it was not a crime to not make such a declaration, and now it
is ?

SSH java applets exist:
Therefore, you could simply publish the java ssh client of your choice on
an off-site web server of your choice, then hit that web server from
behind your proxy using HTTPS (on the standard port 443) using IE or
Netscape, etc., and accomplish your goal.  No tunneling needed - just
plain old https traffic.  The ssh traffic flows only between the off-site
web server publishing the applet and the host you direct it to ssh into.

I have long believed that the constitution of the United States (through
an ammendment) should include protection against involuntary mental
tampering.  It should, for instance, be a constitutional right for a child
not to take their Ritalin, or for an insane man not to take his meds in
order to stand trial (a recent court case whose outcome I do not know).
Along this line, perhaps a more general anti-tampering ammendment could
include protection against the coercion that you describe above.  I feel
that no parent should be forced to alter their child in any way - before
or after the birth.

If there are no provisions whatever for discretionary removal, then BA was
wrong to remove Gilmore - they broke their agreement.  However, I'll bet

don't like it, don't purchase their service.  They have no obligation to
serve you, and you have no right to use their service.  If their
conditions and your needs happen to intersect, then contract them for
service - if not, please move along.
Too bad for you, and not something I would do if I ran the airline, but it
is their property and they can do whatever they please(*) with it ... and
not be acting in bad faith when they do so long as they stay within the
bounds of your contract/agreement with them, which I suspect includes no
language concerning political speech, etc.
And what is your alternative ?  I note that you are attempting to
appropriate the property rights of others (albeit in a small way) through
a court decision (ie. guns) under the auspices of your perceived "right"
to use their property as you see fit.  How do the folks at Reason Magazine
feel about that ?  I read the article, and I am curious to see reader
reaction to it ... most likely most will be distracted by the "drinking
your own breast milk" horror stories.
All fine and good - and I appreciate your efforts at uncovering the secret
directives and generally resisting the erosion of liberties, however it
bothers me greatly that when the obvious is pointed out - that if the
_private airlines_ become unburdened by the ID requirement, they will
simply require it themselves - that you consider this unjust as well.
Further, you invoke some "right" of yours to impose your will on these
private property owners.
It is difficult to imagine how "blah blah employee number four Sun
Microsystems blah blah" is capable of this kind of cognitive dissonance.

queries: "can BA murder you on the plane?!"  "can BA rape you?!"

That's an interesting reaction to the problem.  Here's a better idea:
a) admit that your stupid, self-appointed-netcop blacklists and
self-righteous spam projects are inherently flawed, and are generally
populated by spam reports made by clueless idiots that don't realize they
are reporting forged and/or incorrect addresses.
The net effect is that a lot of innocent bystanders/IP-blocks/ISPs waste a
lot of time dealing with your self-righteous crusader projects.
b) realize that the distributed method you suggest already exists - it is
called procmail(*).
Please spend your sophomore year working on something besides
(*) or you could setup a dummy email account on all web-published
documents, and delete any email that arrives in both mailboxes, or you
could implement a challenge/response mechanism for all new senders.  All
three mechanisms mentioned are distributed, independent, and don't require
some asshole swooping in to save us with his miraculous spews database.

This comparison is invalid.  You are correct that your private property is
... well ... your private property, but if you look closely you will find
that you have a contract (of some kind, be it an agreement, etc.) with
your city - most likely in the form of an easement.  So, by interrupting
their water line, you would be breaking your contract.
Make no mistake, if you hold a contract that AOL entered in with you that
stipulates that they must send your email that you place onto their
property to your friend, then by all means prosecute them to your fullest
ability.  Further, if the AUP/TOS ("contract") that your friend, as a
subscriber, has with AOL stipulates something similar, then again, go
forward with my best wishes.
We all know, however, that AOL has no such contract with you, and that
their contract with your friend most likely boils down to "we will do as
we see fit and you will like it", and further, that even the peering
agreements that AOL has with other service providers, common carrier laws,
etc. most likely do not come anywhere near to stipulating this.  As well
they shouldn't.
So once again, we are back to:
AOL can do whatever they want with the bits you place on their private
This will be my last response to this thread.  Your comments boil down to:
a) You have forgotten that communication existed before the Internet, and
further, that Internet communication exists just fine without AOL.  The
obvious conclusion that using AOL is an act of terminal stupidity is left
as an exercise for the reader.
b) You invoke the tired, meaningless appeal to the big bad corporation
stomping on the little guy.  In reality, AOL can do whatever it pleases
with your bits when you place them on their property, barring any prior
contract to the contrary.  Any legislation that stipulates otherwise is
And I think both of those are absurd.

That is incorrect.  AOL owns their network, and they can respond to your
arbitrary communications on their network in any way they see fit.  Maybe
they will deliver your email to your AOL subscribing friend.  Maybe they
will block that email.  Maybe they will translate the email into French
and reverse the word-order and then send it to your friend.  Maybe they
will print it out and mail it back to you for no reason.  All of these
responses are perfectly legitimate, and represent a private entity using
their property in whatever way they see fit, _provided that_ they abide by
any contracts they have entered into with their subscriber (which, in this
case, is not you).
It amazes me how many people on this list only respect private property
when it is convenient for them to do so.  (For reference, see the "Tim May
argues (correctly) that people can't protest in his house" and, more
recently, the "Gilmore thinks airlines can't refuse him travel for any
reason they see fit"  threads)

I have, for a year or so now, been wondering about all the odd character
strings I am finding in the subjects and body of my spam, and I too
thought about keying on these for detection.
However, I immediately abandoned the idea, as a quick glance over the
content of my legitimate email - to and from developers, technical mailing
lists, etc., revealed that almost all of my legitimate email also contains
seemingly random bits of gibberish and pseudowords.
Try to write the logic that distinguishes this:
if_gre in the tree passes the mbuf to netisr_dispatch(), which in turn
calls if_handoff(), which does something similar.
from this:
dyeiluykxoer dyeiluykcqkutknig dyeiluykkrpmhrku dyeiluykngeqx
dyeiluykoybim dyeiluykbihlyrelg dyeiluyktwucinmdyeiluykwenmttwvm
(actual spam)
I must reiterate that, given the relentless efficiency of spam-spiders,
merely publishing a shadow email address on all web documents that your
real email address reside on, and deleting all email sent to both accounts
is my current favorite anti-spam mechanism.  Simple to DIY, and requires
no centralization.
