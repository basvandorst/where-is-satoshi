You can now conveniently and comfortably connect with our Doctors and
Pharmacists through the Internet. I T Drop me:  One summer evening, during a violent thunderstorm, a mother was tucking her
small boy into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked¡¡with
a tremor in his voice, "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?"¡¡The mother
smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. "I can't dear," she said, "I have to
sleep with Daddy."A long silence was broken at last by a shaken little voice
saying, "The big sissy."
A woman went into a funeral home to make arrangements for her husband's
funeral. She told the director that she wanted her husband to be buried in a
dark blue suit. He asked, "Wouldn't it just be easier to bury him in the
black suit that he's wearing?""No," she insisted as she handed him a check
to buy a dark blue suit. "It must be blue."When she came back for the wake,
she saw her husband in the coffin, and he was wearing a beautiful blue suit.
She told the director how much she loved the suit and asked how much it
cost. He said, "Actually, it didn't cost anything. The funniest thing
happened. As soon as you left, another corpse was brought in wearing a blue
suit. I noticed that they were about the same size, and asked the other
widow if she would mind if her husband were buried in a black suit. She said
that was fine with her, so I switched the heads."
