Dear Ms. Madrid:
Purposes of this letter:
1  Send you a copy of New Mexico complaint CV 2002 3425 and summon to
New Mexico supreme court chief justice Patricio M Serna.
Serna apparently relayed this request through legal process server Susan
2 Chief judge W John Brennan of the second judicial district defrauded
us out of over $1,000.   In an effort to recover our money without
litigation, we filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.
The Better Business Bureau was not able to directly help us recover our
money.  But Mr Jerry Shipman of the Better Business Bureau recommended
that we contact you personally in his letter dated January 28, 2002.
Shipman's letter is posted at
Since we were unable to recover our money outside of court, we were
forced to file this breach of contract and harassment lawsuit, CV 2002
3 Review history of this unfortunate lawyer and judge abuse of the legal
system with hope of quick settlement.
Morales and Payne brought suit to remedy injustices seen in section 2 A,
B, C of the complaint.
All evidence of guilt of defendants is in writing.  These are prima
facie cases.
Criminal violations of the federal Privacy Act and New Mexico state laws
on libel were committed by  publishing the false and defaming documents
seen in Exhibit A and on internet at
Lawyers and judges rather than forcing prompt settlement of the damages
caused by 2 A B C, decided to abuse both federal and state legal systems
by fighting.
This has now resulted in seven New Mexico and five federal lawsuits.
Only the lawyers are making money abusing the legal system.
Tomorrow judge Kenneth Brown scheduled an illegal to dismiss a complaint
filed by lawyer Jerry Walz.  Brown,  Walz, and Serna  have been sued
over this attempt to deny plaintiff Payne relief damages described in 2
Judge Brown threatened process servers Sharon Apodoca and her mother,
Susan Salinas, with arrest yesterday if he was served in CV 2002 3425.
Affidavit attesting to  Brown's behavior is seen at
If this illegal hearing takes place, matters are sure to get worse.
We ask that you review the enclosed complaint, then attempt to bring
closure through settlement to these unfortunate event caused by lawyers.
