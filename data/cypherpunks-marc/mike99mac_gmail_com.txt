Hello lists,
I have again started a new job, moving on from Innovation Data Processing
to ADP.
At Innovation, helping to roll out the FDRPASVM product that allows you to
migrate running Linux and z/VM systems to new DASD regardless of
manufacturer was a challenging and satisfying project.  However, most of
that work was winding down.
As ADP has a continually growing z/VM and Linux environment, they should
keep me busy for many years to come.  I look forward to this new role.
