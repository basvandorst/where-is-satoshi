In some cases this also may be VASCO DigiPass, which is system very similar
to SecurID, only cheaper. This technology seems to be quite popular in
Europe as couple banks in Poland routinely issue tokens, both VASCO and
SecurID to their customers for online authorization, and the tokens are used
both in password generation (as described in article) and challenge-response

Erm... when you use OpenPGP, or really any other modern crypto
protocol, you don't put actual plaintext through RSA, RSA operates
only on a hash or random session key for symmetric cipher.y
