I don't think so, i mean, looking at the error message it seems that
something is missing, in this case Qt4.
My suggestion is to download the last version if skype with an static
Qt library compiled.
I have Qt 3 and Qt 4 working in my system, this means is OK to have
both installed.
So, download the static skype version from here:
and see what happens. Everything should work just fine. =)
