@_subject: Re: panix.com hijacked 
We have had a comparable experience and now, on checking the DNS for
the hijacked panix domain, I see name-servers similar to those I noted
on that previous occasion.  Known under various names that infer a UK
connection, (such as Fibranet Services Ltd/freeparking.co.uk) but in
fact seem to be Activebytes Software of 2530 Channin Drive Wilmington
Delaware, with servers routed via Koallo Inc in Canada!
So far as we were able to determine, there was no actual UK presence.
MelbourneIT appear to have a U.S. Office near San Francisco:
  2200 Powell Street, Sixth Floor, Suite 690, Emeryville CA 94608
which would be slightly more accessible for service of writs, etc ...
