Indeed, having a "Storage Domain" in Qubes could mitigate these
issues. This is explained in the Qubes OS Architecture document.[1]
However, this is not currently implemented in Qubes. So, for now,
we're forced to trust at least some of our storage devices (i.e., our
main internal system drive(s), not our external (e.g., USB) drives).

This is true when it comes to remote attacks (e.g., over the
Internet), but there are several alternative possibilities for
compromising disk firmware:
 * Some US manufacturers, being legally compelled to cooperate with
the NSA in the name of national security, install firmware with
NSA-accessible backdoors (which do not necessarily remain accessible
*only* to the NSA).
 * Some non-US manufacturers are similarly compelled to cooperate with
their own governments.
 * Hackers gain access to some manufacturers' internal networks and
implant hidden backdoors in firmware which gets installed in the
factory. (Or pose as potential employees and get hired; or bribe,
blackmail, or coerce high-level employees; or...)
 * Trusted contributors to major open-source software projects (who
most likely do not use Qubes) get hacked, and the hackers use their
credentials to insert hidden backdoors in software updates which are
then downloaded into the dom0s of Qubes users, granting full access.
Sometimes, these are discovered a long time later. Other times,
they're never discovered. Maybe one out of a million
maximally-paranoid users reads every line of source code, understands
it all, and compiles everything themselves for every single software
update. (Even then, there's no guarantee they'll notice every backdoor.)
Again, interdiction is not the only option. It's much more efficient
if every disk which rolls off the assembly line is already infected
(see above).
Certainly, Qubes users are much better off when it comes to remote
attacks. My point is that we're no better off when it comes to
non-remote firmware- and hardware-based attacks, which are now a very
real threat.

On 2015-02-16, Kaspersky Lab announced[1]:
It may=20
Affected HDD brands include[2] (but are probably not limited to):
 * Western Digital
 * Maxtor
 * Seagate
 * Hitachi
 * Micron
 * OCZ
 * OWC
 * Corsair
 * Mushkin
 * Samsung
 * Toshiba
This is bad news for everyone, including Qubes users, since there's
nothing we can really do at the OS/software level to protect ourselves
from this kind of persistent HDD firmware infection (or compromised
firmware and hardware in general). Measures like AEM don't help if the
drives are already infected before we even purchase them. If we want
freedom and safety in the future, our best bet is probably to
(continue to) push for open-source firmware and hardware.
