STRONG BUY Boxing is back! Both NBC and FOX are planning Boxing TV       reality shows this upcoming season, The Contender, starring Sylvester       Stallone, and The Next Great Champ, starring champion fighter Oscar De La       Hoya. Each reality show brings us back to a time when people knew who the       boxing champions were and were excited about big matches. Both shows will       feature amateur fighters training and fighting each week in a series of       bouts that will eventually leave one contestant standing. In response to       America's renewed love affair with boxing; TKO Sports Group has once again       taken the lead by creating an amateur boxing, fitness, and toy lines for       families and children. By focusing on America's youth, brand building, and       licensing TKO hopes to expand its market to a new generation of boxing,       fitness and martial arts enthusiasts of all ages. TKO produced close to       $17 million in revenue last year and is projecting to increase sales by       25% this year. TKHL is a unique company we feel offers a value play at       today's pricing.
