Watches, clocks and alarm clocks manufactured in Switzerland bear the designation -Swiss made- (or its abbreviation "Swiss") as well as the logo of the producer or distributor. This label enjoys a solid reputation throughout the world. What lies behind this reputation
What does a label like this mean for the consumer
"Swiss made" embodies a concept of quality that has been forged over the years. It includes the technical quality of watches (accuracy, reliability, water-resistance and shock-resistance), as well as their aesthetic quality (elegance and originality of design). It covers both traditional manufacturing and new technologies (micro-electronics).
The Swiss are not the only watchmakers to manufacture high-quality timepieces and are consequently faced with strong competition. However, thanks to their unique infrastructure and to their know-how and spirit of innovation, they have succeeded in maintaining their leading position.
The intrinsic value of the "Swiss made" label, therefore, is the result of considerable efforts on the part of watchmaking companies, who are ultimately responsible for maintaining its reputation. Billie Bullard
