When you really look at human behavior the thing that remains the same =
is core motives. The competition makes sense in that it is human nature =
to aggresse for resources. We are challenged in the "fact" that we =
'want' to belong among the other five. This will never change but=85=85=85=
What is really a travesty here is that most of us have been saying "hey =
this is critical" and can now shift to "I told you so"=85 in that if you =
did what we said to do 1 =85 5 =85. 10 =85 years ago .. you would have =
"mitigated" this risk..
Basically, genetically we have not changed, so what behavior would =
suggest that (even with the introduction of faster calculators).. why =
would we change? Just means we would do X faster =85=85.
This is my first comment to the list.. please flame me privately to save =
the list :) *** or publicly who think I should really be spanked!!! ***
