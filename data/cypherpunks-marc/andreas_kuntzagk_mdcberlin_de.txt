Please see the news release of the AN.ON project:
"... Since it is not permissive to release information about current
proceedings according to German law, the project partners did not inform
the public at first. Based on the fact that the developed software has
been released in the source code since the beginning of the Open Source
Project, also the implemented recording function was of course released.
