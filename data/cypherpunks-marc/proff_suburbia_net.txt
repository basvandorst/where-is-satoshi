It is not necessary for the entire population to adopt a technology; merely
a user-base of sufficient size to forfill the technical & social requirements
of the project leaders. Visions of world domination are for
propaganda, not for actualisation. The 95% of the population which
comprise the flock have never been my target, and neither should
they be yours; it's the 2.5% percent at either end of the normal that
I find in my sights, one to be cherished and the other to be destroyed.

@_subject: time-delayed release of information 
You need a trusted time-notary who will sign or publish hashes of the event
in a manner which is hard to undo (e.g in a major news-paper). This is a
known art.
A related but harder problem is time-delayed release of information.
If you can predict the future cost/CPU speed then you can create
a problem which can't be solved with current technology at a reasonable price.
The future isn't predictable enough to do this over the longer term.
If you have a large enough transmitter/receiver, you can transmit
they key to distant astral bodies and wait for the reflection.
However if this became routine, spy sats might intercept the transmissions.
You can launch a pair of notary space probes and have them bounce
an encrypted key stream between them with lasers for a specified
period of time (using space as a storage device) before sending
decrypts back. If the sats were moving away from earth at significant
speed due to VEEGA like alignment windows, it might be a long time before
these sats could ever be destroyed.

The bigger question is not predicting the effect of Bernstein's
paper, but rather predicting how many similar ideas will be discovered
in the next 30 years, or have already been discovered but not
We can see computers and decreased cost/speed of communication as societal
intelligence amplification devices. Both these two variables are increasing
(even if the effect is on order of ln < e < sqrt), but it would be naive
to presume there won't be more of them.

What I employ in rubberhose is a hardened version of this:
Take two encryption functions (or one encryption and one decryption
function), e_1, and e_2, and some salt. For each lsb in
the block number:
This provides a n^2 tree of keys such that even if you break one
of the leaves traveling up the branches to other leaves remains
very difficult. It also protects against yet to be discovered
related key, related plain-text attacks.
If you have blind faith in your ciphers:
Is just fine.

Europeans certainly don't dislike Americans for Godlessness. The
extraordinary religiosity (whether over Gods or Presidents) in the
US is one of the reasons for European frowning over that country.
Americans would do well to consider its scientific and economic
successes as primarily stemming from:

You can't easily get away with storing the IV as multiple parts of the IO
pipe like to see blocks in 2^n form. The approach I take in Rubberhose is to calculate the IV from a
very fast checksum routine and salt.

This statement is surprisingly close to the truth. In top black
hat circles CDC people were always viewed as joke. They were loosely
tolerated because they claimed to also share this view and were
incapable of gaining turf.  Their recent attempts at producing
something other than publicity for their drinking antics, while
noble, is clearly the work of idiot savantism.  New recruits may
have some hidden qualities, but all the CDC founders are deeply
