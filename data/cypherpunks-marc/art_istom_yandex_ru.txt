I think your point is very true. Also I forsee that such strategy will
be adopted by another corporations like Google, Twitter and other.
It is absolutely pointless to create another "entry point" for users,
except for the purpose of categorization of users to facilitate their
further monetization. This is done in the interests of corporations, not
in the interests of the people.
I believe we should boicot such initiative from corporations in favor our onw interests. They should create equal conditions for access to
information for all users.

Using Windows + Tor contradicts with the fact of collusion US
corporations with US government to commandeer Internet.

I think he in custody now with all such accusations. So why worry?
Also how would you have behaved in his place with all such arguments from both sides? Of course you would be silent. It is right decision in my poin of view.
I don't stand for any sides. We don't have any evidence. It is work for
Germany's LE. So let they do their work. And after we see result - it make sense to discuss something.
