MRS. SUZANA NUHAN VAYE
%BARRISTER ALEXANDRIA GAWABIAN
Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you.I believe you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your
country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins.
My name is MRS. SUZANA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. And My Husband is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy Minister of Public Works,Liberia.He was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office.
Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him.You can verify this from your
country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:
(i) (ii) Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5 million through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company Abroad. All that is needed is for my lawyer to instruct the company to
transfer the funds to your account, I will renumerate you with 20% at the
end, but most of all is that I solicit your trust in this transaction.
I have been confined only to our country home and all my calls are
monitored, So I will advise you contact my private Attorney on his contact stated below for onward proceedings.
%BARRISTER ALEXANDRIA GAWABIAN
You will kindly aid me to invest the money in your country, kindly include
your private telephone and fax numbers where you can always be reached,your residential or company address to enable him send detail
information/documents to you.
Best Regards
MRS. SUZANA NUHAN VAYE
