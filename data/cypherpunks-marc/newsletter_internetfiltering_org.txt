Newsletter           2
May 7 2002
Welcome to our second         newsletter.
Last month we send our         first newsletter to 392 subscribers and we have had great responses from         some of them. This month we will be sending the newsletter out to over         1034 people. Thank you for all your words of praise and support and         making this newsletter grow so rapidly.
        We have had 2 complaints so far by people not able to read our         newsletter in HTML format. If you are having the same problem please         send us a email and we will be happy to supply you with an plain text         version.
        We are looking for articles and news from the filtering communities         around the globe. If you have a interesting piece of news or would like         to send us an article feel free to do so. Please send all articles to
        newsletter.         Well it has been a quit month on the news side of things. In Ohio the         new Child Porn law has come under heavy         resistance. Where do we draw the line between freedom of speech and the         protection of the rights of others. There is now even talk within the         filtering community that adult pay sites do  not need to be filtered         as these sites are inaccessible without a username and password. Do         people really forget about the free previews of these sites and then         also the websites were passwords and usernames for these services are         freely available. Then there is the National         Academies' National Research Council that is of the opinion that         No one fix for Net porn and kids 'The whole idea of         supervision ... is overrated'. We hope that next month we can report         some positive commentary. All current news can be found on our
        news page.
A couple of companies         have launched new or updated products:
GFI         MailSecurity Earns Checkmark Certification for Anti-Virus         Protection. Comprehensive email security package utilizes multiple virus         engines to protect networks; also provides exploit detection, threats         analysis & email content checking. GFI has         announced that MailSecurity, its new email security package for Exchange         and SMTP servers, has been awarded Anti-Virus Checkmark Level 1         certification from West Coast Labs. The certification ensures that GFI         MailSecurity meets the Checkmark program's rigorous standards for         detecting in-the-wild viruses. The         Anti-Virus Checkmark is a globally recognized program that tests         computer security products to determine whether they can detect viruses         that are actually causing infections in the real world. Certification         under the program gives end users a clear and independent indication of         a given product's virus identification capabilities. The testing         procedure is repeated at least every three months to ensure continued         compliance. N2H2         Releases New Sentian(TM) FS Internet Filtering Product Line.
