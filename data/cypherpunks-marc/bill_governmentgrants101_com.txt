@_subject: Request To Swap Links 
Dear Friend,
May I invite you to add your link to our popular site: 'Small Business and Government Grants Tips'.
I'm sure you are aware of the value of reciprocal linking and how we would both benefit by becoming link partners via improved link popularity rankings within the search engines. A link exchange will benefit us both. As a matter of fact our success with the search engines can be attributed mainly to our willingness to exchange links with other websites like yours.
To complete the link swap please do this:
First, go to the following page and add your link to our links page (this will allow you to control your link text and category):
Then, add our link to your links page. Please use the following:
Title (link text): Free government grants and small business tips
URL: Description: Small business and government grants resource
Note: please make sure the title above is clickable (the title should be the actual hyperlinked link text)
Your link will be approved and added to our links pages once we find a reciprocal link back to our site from your site.
Best Regards
Bill, Webmaster
