Thank you and all those who support me, or at least support the goal most
(if not all) here try to achieve.

I have changed my signature. Is the mail that you get when you subscribe
also saying something similar? If not, it might be included there, so we
can point people to that mail.

Please do not toppost.
Writing to people privatly will not result in the much needed effect. Now
some people will see where to go and NOT post an answer or directly go to
Considering technical questions, there realy is no grey area. Technical
questions go to suse-linux-e. Community questions to openSUSE. If you have
a questions that contains both, see if it has anything technical in it. If
it has, it should go to suse-linux-e
They sure can. If you stat with a negative question as a subject, I don't
think that is very helpfull to anybody. As if asking when somebody stopped
beating their wife.
I know. So if the tone of my standard reply is too harsh, please tell me
how to soften it, without loosing its meaning.

My idea is to just kill off this list and make a new opensuse-community
Untill then or another solution arises, I will keep posting to go to the
correct place.
For those who DO answer technical questions on this list.
1) You help poluting the list and therefore killing of this list for its
intended purpose. This goes for all, including me. I try to resist
answering any technical questions here.
2) If you do, also include a pointer to the correct list.

Do not take this as a flame. It is intend to get you the best support for now and in the future.
openSUSE is the comunity and SUSE is the distribution. This means that this openSUSE mailinglist is about the community. The mailinglist for technical help is on *suse-linux-e*
Just subscribe via this email address: suse-linux-e-subscribe
post your original email again there, and you will get a straight answer.
#  opensuse for general discussion about the openSUSE (development) project. # For general questions related to released SUSE Linux versions # (eg. 9.3, 10.0) please use suse-linux-e Please take a look at  to see wich list is exactly for what purpose.
Again, this is not a flame. This is intended to bring you to the correct
place so you will get better help _and_ to keep this list free from
unwanted treads.
Thanks and I hope you will soon find a solution.
