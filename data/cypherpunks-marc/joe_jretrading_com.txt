Debian does that sort of thing automagically. I have a working mariadb
so that will be used by anything that needs it.

No, stretch doesn't have php5. I've already had to go through loads of
php, replacing stuff which has been deprecated for a while and now no
longer exists.
OK, thanks, I'll give that a try next time I have some time.

Of course. It's been around for a while, and if it didn't work for
anybody, it would have been fixed by now. But much of my time was
spent poking around the web for clues, without success, so I've asked
here in case there's a simple 'ah, you forgot to do xxxx' that I
haven't found.
This is a web problem, nothing to do with roundcube, but as I said, as
far as I can see, the bits are in place for apache2 to work, I just
can't see why it isn't. This isn't the first alias/symlink php thing
I've had trouble with, but previously the cause has been obvious, a
missing or incorrect symlink, a filename wrong. For example, I've found
references to 'roundcubemail' as part of the calling URL, but the
apache2.conf file alias is clearly just 'roundcube'. I've tried both,
of course, just in case...
As for prayer, that just plain looks wrong, as if someone has taken an
in-house program from UofC and just dropped it into the Debian
repository, without actually adding the stuff to make it install
properly. I'm genuinely curious as to whether that works for anyone.
I've just replied here about mariadb, which in its early days in
Debian, also wasn't 'plumbed in' properly, so I know it can happen. But
there are a few more avenues to explore before I raise a bug report.

I'm replacing a server, I've used Courier IMAP for many years but
decided to go with Dovecot this time. That was no trouble at all, it
Just Worked.

Yes it is, actually. I've been running an exim4/IMAP DNS-based mail
setup for nearly twenty years, I do know a bit about it. Webmail is an
accessory, that can work in addition to proper email. In the case of
Squirrelmail, that's exactly what it did. I was expecting roundcube to
similarly just 'drop in'.

============================== START ==============================
Anyone know of a webmail that works on stretch?
I've just spent half an afternoon trying first roundcube then prayer.
Roundcube works (allegedly) with apache. I'm not an expert on apache2,
but as far as I can see, there is an apache2.conf existing and enabled
for roundcube, and it leads via an alias to a real index.php in the
right place. I just get a 404, and I've tried with and without a
trailing slash and a final index.php. Yes, I've restarted apache2,
several times, and my other php stuff on the server works.
Prayer seems incomplete. There is no process running (it's supposedly
standalone) and the configuration file seems untouched from upstream. I
expect Debian packages to deal with the plumbing, connecting it to my
mailboxes and MTA, and setting any ports necessary, maybe asking me a
few questions. The configuration file contains no mention of anything
but University of Cambridge links, and the port is 80, despite my
having a working apache2 there throughout the installation. It may be
as simple as changing that to an unused port (plus associated firewall
fiddling) but I didn't try it, as I'm sure a lot of other stuff needs
doing. It was a long time ago that I put Squirrelmail, no longer a Debian
package, on my old server but I'm pretty sure I installed it and it
Just Worked. Does anyone have either of these packages working, or indeed Yet
Another webmail? I must make clear that it's a backup measure, I've yet
to find a webmail I could stand using every day, but I've found it
useful on several occasions when other things have stopped working.

Thanks, I've used it for about ten years up to wheezy, it has always
been plan B, I'd just prefer Debian-supported software if possible.

I'm sure it's doable if the need is great enough, but no, Debian
packages shows it in wheezy, jessie and sid only.
