No *this* is a very bad idea. We have lots of foreign students
here, and information I'd want to look up is often more precise in
English, than say, German.
It's bad enough that I have to apply a dozen mouse clicks to get
some websites to give me the language I want; I don't want another
mechanism with an even higher perceived accuracy for that.
