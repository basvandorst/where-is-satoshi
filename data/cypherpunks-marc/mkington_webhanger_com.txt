The keys. This to me is the critical point for widespread adoption, key
management. How do you do this in a way that doesn't put people off
There are two new efforts I'm aware if trying to solve this in a user
friendly way are  and Parley's approach does at least deal with the longevity of the private key
although it does boil security down to a password, if I can obtain their
packet and the salt I can probably brute force the password.
I've exchanged mails with the mailpile.is guys and I think they're still
looking at the options.
