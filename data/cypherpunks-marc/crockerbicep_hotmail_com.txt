You dont know me but my name is %TIF. My friend and I were at a party the other night and I saw you there. I really wanted to meet you that night, I thought you looked like a really nice guy and that you were good looking too :-P
I had to leave the party so I asked my friend to get your email address for me and she did. I would like to meet you. I hope to hear back from you :-)
