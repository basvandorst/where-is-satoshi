@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] IBM says Block Tor 
IBMs history of providing hardware and support to various regimes who
do things that may be morally questionable is long and well documented.
There were, for example, these guys they worked closely with in Germany
in the 1930s and 1940s who did some slightly disturbing things using IBM
technology. See  for some details.
It is not, given their history, shocking to read that IBM is against
software such as Tor.
