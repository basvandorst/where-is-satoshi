Beef Barons Set for $tock $tampede
As America’s soaring demand for quality meats approaches $2.1 billion, these young guns are moving on the very best Eastern claims.
      You can make               a fortune on stocks that the Wall Street insiders overlook and this               New York custom meat company already serves Wall Street’s               elite with the best beef in the business! It’s only a matter               of time before that herd discovers DFDR stock as well!
    By then, you could be in 1,000% growth territory…starting from a rock solid $0.28 share price and watching it soar past $4!
    Growing a $5,000 start to $71,428 in just 12 months!
 Company:
Diamond Ranch Foods, Ltd.
 Ticker:  Current:  Projection:
$4.00 in 12 months
   Recommendation:                       Buy now at any price to $1.00. This is                       an aggressive investment not suited to all investment styles.                       Please limit your investment to that amount which you are                       comfortable placing at a higher level of risk.
       Diamond               Ranch Foods could quadruple company revenues to $41.8 million within               12 months moving aggressively into dominant positions in 1) hotel,               restaurant, and food service trade, 2) custom-cut prime meats in               grocery chains, plus 3) private label branding.
    This may be a perfect entry point as investors               could be making a killing on this stock within a few months and               it’s already reaping record sales results! Revenues are up 37.8% 2004 over 2003… leaping                   from $6.9 million to a whopping $9.5 million year end projection…                 By year-end 2005, with 6-7 new acquisitions completed, DFDR                   could be posting $41.8 million in sales…
With a net profit of $5.6 million…that’s about 11¢ earnings per share!
     Thanks                   to dramatic changes in the science of healthy dieting, Americans                   are adding high-quality beef to their menus in record numbers!                   Not only could that drive soaring demand to Diamond Ranch Foods,                   it sets the stage for a highly successful acquisition plan set                   to roll up a Ponderosa scale position in East Coast markets.
    At current rates of growth, Diamond Ranch               Foods will have acquired 6 to 7 well-established quality meat businesses               by the end of 2005. At this pace, the $41.8 million revenue goal               and $5.6 million net profit goals are more than realistic.
    It currently operates a state-of-the-art               7,000 square foot facility adhering to the highest standards of               sanitation and product handling. It handles every manner of meat               product, including poultry, pork, veal and lamb, and specialty meats.
    As the DFDR empire grows, you can expect               a breakout when the news gets to the Wall Street pros. But don’t               spend too long pondering this decision. Those guys are eating Diamond               Ranch Foods’ steaks and burgers for lunch today!
