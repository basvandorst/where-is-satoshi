    Okay, here's a synopsis;  He starts with the premise that after
 Sept. 11 'everything changed', and that safety needs now will start
 to trump all personal liberties.  He goes on to describe before and
 after scenes from different parts of society:  Before:  We cared about medical records privacy
After: Today, security 'needs' trump all privacy 'rights'
Before: Americans demanded better, faster, cheaper air service
After: 'No one complains, even silently, about exposing dirty
underwear in a public place' (direct quote referring to hand checks
of luggage at airports)
Before: Face scanning technology is a frightening invasion of our
After: These technologies are 'comforting' today
Before: NAFTA is good for the economy, and open trade leads the way
to economic prosperity
After: Fortifying the border with Canada is an utmost priority
Before: Privatization of airport security makes economic and business
After:  Trust in central government is unquestioned and total. Federalizing airport security is a requirement.
Here's his closing paragraph:

This guy (Ponemon) needs a basic math lesson ...
Ponemon criticized the federal government for not doing enough to ensure the
FTC could enforce privacy infractions. Recent increases in the FTC's budget
aren't enough, he said, mocking the government's statement that it had
boosted the agency's budget by 50%.
"If you start at zero, 50% is only 50 cents," Ponemon said.

Okay, here's a question from a 'stupid fuck'; Did *you* read the order?
Check out Section 7 (a) (3):
Sec. 7.  Relationship to Other Law and Forums.
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to --
(1)  authorize the disclosure of state secrets to any person not otherwise
authorized to have access to them;
(2)  limit the authority of the President as Commander in Chief of the Armed
Forces or the power of the President to grant reprieves and pardons; or
(3)  limit the lawful authority of the Secretary of Defense, any military
commander, or any other officer or agent of the United States or of any
State to detain or try any person who is not an individual subject to this
Now I am not a lawyer, but doesn't that mean that this can be applied to

Yes, but every travel magazine, travel agent, and even the airlines tell
you not to put medications you rely on in your checked luggage, for fear of
losing them, or losing short-term access to them.  It's not like it would be
easy (legally anyway) to refill that prescription while on the road ...
