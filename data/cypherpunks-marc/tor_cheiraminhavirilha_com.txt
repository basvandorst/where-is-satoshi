I believe you need immediate help, to capture evidence and/or reverse  engineer malware.
If the first case (capture evidence), advise you to join an IRC  channel on server irc.oftc.net channel  - me or others can help  you setup a Linux bridge to capture packets between your computer and  ISP. You will need to use ethernet cables to connect your computer to  your ISP, avoid wifi, and need a second spare computer with 2 ethernet  If the second (reverse engineer the malware), I advise you to join an  IRC channel on server irc.freenode.net on channel  and/or channel   - me or others can help you with x86/64 stuff (assembly).
You can use pidgin ( to talk on the IRC channels.
wish you luck.
