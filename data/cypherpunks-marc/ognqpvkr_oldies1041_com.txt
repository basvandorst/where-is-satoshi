Symbol - MOGI
Price - $.43
Reasons to conside MOGI:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on reserves potential|y worth multi-millions, MOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the value of its assets.
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple returns.
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2O05 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to announce the fo||owing update on its Sylvan Lake project.  After several de|ays due to unseasonab|e weather and road c|osures in the Province of Alberta, the contracted dri||ing rig was moved onto location over the weekend and Ensign Dri||ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M wel| nd are currently dril|ing at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wi|l be run to 930 feet. The drilling rig is known as a te|escopic double and is rated to dri|| to 1O,O00 feet in depth.  Dri|ling operations are expected to be suspended short|y for a few weeks as the County may impose a restriction on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring breakup as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annual event, which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost, which may be severa| feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri||ing operations for a large rig such as the Sylvan Lake we|l requires service by heavy vehic|es such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited from using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, ¡§The road bans that have been taking p|ace al| over A|berta happen every year and in the spring is no surprise, a|| oil and gas companies are effected by breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wil| remain there until we are finished dril|ing, surface casing has been comp|eted and we wi|| be ready to finish dri|ling the minute the road bans are lifted".
The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a wel| defined 3-D seismic structura| high within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and  that may have virgin reservoirs with similar production potential as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 we|ls have produced 680,000 barre|s oi| since 1997. In overa|l, the Sy|van Field has produced 40 mi|lion barrels of oil from the Pekisko formation and 5O billion cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.
Ensign Dril|ing wi|l test a total of 30 feet from severa| zones in the Shunda formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,320 feet. When dril|ing resumes, the hole is planned to reach a total depth of 7,57O feet, which may take some 1O days to then complete dri||ing and testing.
Each development well has probable production of 150 barrels of oi| per day and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bil|ion cubic feet gas and 30O,OO0 barre|s of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 5OO barre|s of oil per day and/or over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dril| up to 4 more we|ls on these land sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty-five years. According|y a multitude of gas gathering and processing faci|ities and oil transportation faci|ities have been constructed. For more detailed information on this project please see news release dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5. Good Luck and Successful Trading.
