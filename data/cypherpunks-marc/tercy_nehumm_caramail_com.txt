I am Tercy Nuhan Vaye,the wife of late Issac Nuhan Vaye,
 deputy minister of public works under President
 charles taylor of Liberia.
 Before the political upheaval in liberia my late
 Husband was a good and close friend of president
 charles taylor and a member of his inner caucus.But of
 late when liberia crisis came up again,with the rebels
trying to oust charles taylor out of government and
 liberia,president charles taylor became very
 uncomfortable with some of his loyalists which my late
 Husband  happened to be one of them because he had the
 believe that at the rate at which the rebel group was
 closing in on him in Monrovia(which is the seat of
 power)was as a result of the leakage of some vital
 security information  from his cabinet and he decided
 to eliminate some of his cabinet members which my
 father happened to be a victim.
 It started in the name of an uncovered coup and he
 ordered the arrest of some of his cabinet ministers
 and the Vice President Moses Blah on the 5th of june
 which my father was included and some days later we
 learnt about my father's death alongside with John
 Winpoe Yormie, deputy minister of national security.
 My Mother and i actually knew why my Husband was
 murdered because before the political mayhem in
 liberia,my late father  and President charles taylor
 have maintained a good relationship and he has
 assisted him in lodging funds from the sales of
diamond in different banks and security companies
 which my late Husband also benefited from it until at
 the wake of rebellious war in liberia my Husband was
 not getting along with President Charles taylor
 because of his tyranic law which created a breach in
 their relationship and with the alarming rate at which
 the rebels are advancing into Monrovia to unseat
 President charles taylor he was no longer sure of
 some of his cabinet members and decided to eliminate
 them under the disguise that they were coup plotters
 Before the death of my Husband at the peak of his
 relationship with president charles taylor,he was able
 to accumulate some funds $31,600,000.00 (US$31.6million)which he
 deposited with a security company in Ghana from the
 deals he did for the president.
 Basically my mother and i require a trustworthy person
 that can assist us to retrieve our funds from the
 security company in Ghana.Life has been very unstable
 for us(my mum,my youngers ones and i) and i would not
 want to bore you with all we went through but for the
 sake of my late fathers death. All the necessary documents for the
 deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in
 neigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of
 been killed by president charles taylor and the unrest
 in Liberia.
 Ironically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to
 grant  president charles taylor assylum in Nigeria in
 order to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to
 do all  we can at earnest to retrieve the funds from
 the security company and leave West Africa before he
 eventually comes to Nigeria.
 Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on
 how we can proceed to get the funds from the security
 company.
 Best regards,
 Tercy Nehumm
