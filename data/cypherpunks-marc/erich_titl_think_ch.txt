Mhhh ?
For nerds, yes... else I doubt it.
where do you connect _to_ ? Would that not need a reverse entry?
Agreed :-( maybe we should buy shares in Verisign

The way I (barely) understood OE was that it requires a server/client pair...
Now your grandmother runs a server, or you are running one yourself. If none of both sides do, OE is not possible.
still a great product....

This is mostly true for users outside north america. Bear in mind that ipsec_monitor uses Perl which is not readily avaialble on some boarder zone hardware/software. I for once use LEAF with FreeS/Wan which does not have Perl (and possibly never will for security considerations). It might  be possible to rewrite this in sh.
Basically I believe that a tool like ipsec_monitor should be triggered by pluto ??
I believe the funding has been lost, someone has to pay the rent.
Not everyone is ready to jump on the 2.6 bandwagon right away. It would be nice to see FreeS/Wan live for a while, so let's hope OpenS/Wan will survive.
