Greetings, My name is Michael Muzenda and I work for the Zimbabwe customs at the
Harare International airport. We have not met before but I am writing to you
seeking your co-operation for the safety of a treasure. During the preparation of the last election in my country by politician,
that has been won and lost though with its attendant controversial result, a
lot of activities took place between the government party (ZANU-PF) and the opposition (ZAPU). In one of our routine checks on imported goods at the airport, we discovered to our amazement some consignments in the container. The packaging got
our attention because it was documented in the bill of laden as photographic
films but on close examination, these films were cut in the shape of currency
notes though with some disguise here and there with real photographic films.
We tested it and confirm it to be neon tested currency note in USA dollar
of 100- bill denomination. We immediately confiscated it but without reporting officially for reasons I will explain. After careful study of the situation my colleagues and I agreed to inter- change the boxes containing the currency with similar boxes containing
photo films in the container since the real content was not officially
declared. We immediately and successfully relocated the boxes out of the port for
closer check which revealed that $15.9m has been disguise as photographic
films. As expected we knew that the owner or owners must be either government
people or powerful politicians because some security agents were detailed by
His Excellency Robert Mugabe came later to ask for the officials who were on
duty and those who signed for the release of the container. My colleagues
were arrested and since then I have been in hiding though we have
successfully moved the boxes abroad. Should you be in a position to guarantee our safety and confidentially
offer your co-operation in putting the money into circulation, we will share
in the percentage of 29% for you and 71% for my colleagues and me. If this
proposal is acceptable to you, please reach me at my e-mail. Sincerely, Mr. Michael Muzenda
