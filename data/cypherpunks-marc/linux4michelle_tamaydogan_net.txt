Oi, I see, I have installed Stretch last year and PHP5 was there.
PHP7 is MOSTLY incompatible with PHP5!
However, it seems the php5 virtualpackage is still in place,
but not the corresponding real package,
which seems to be removed by the Debian Team.

Ehm what?
Here php5 is working properly!
I run it on all of my servers.
You mean there is no php7 in Stretch!

Hi Joe,
I know, I am a little bit late, but I use Squirrelmail since more
then 15 years now and had no problems from Woody to Stretch with it.
I use it even to access my GMail account  :-)  because then I have
not to bother with those stupid GMail interface and I can do whatever
I want.
Best is you create a seperated Virtualhost like and decompress the Squirrelmail archive into it. The run the config
script in  [DOCROOT]/config/conf.pl and set it up.
Should work out of the box.
Oh, use https:// and make sure any security is activated in conf.pl.
Have a nice Sunday
