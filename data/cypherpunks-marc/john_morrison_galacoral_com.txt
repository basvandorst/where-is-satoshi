The advice given to me was that if you access sensitive data and you plan to travel to the US, or other potentially "hostile" country, you should take a machine that does not hold any sensitive data. Then only use a VPN to access it remotely. Preferably one that does not leave any trace on the disk.
If you must deliver data to somebody in that country use an encrypted memory stick, or separate encrypted laptop, and get a colleague to set up the encryption so that you do not know the key. Once the data has been successfully delivered then the key can be sent.
All a bit James Bond if you ask me.

I recall a similar instance in the US about two years ago (damn if I
can find a citation at the moment). The legal issue was slightly
different than above, where the above claims he does not have to
surrender due to [possible] self incrimination.
In the previous the issue raised was whether a computer, obtained
through a warrant, also included the password to decrypt the data on
the computer. In the later, the judge ruled that the password to
decrypt the data was included since the warrant included the computer.
Standard disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, but I am interested in the
legal interpretations of these security related matters as most others
on the list.
