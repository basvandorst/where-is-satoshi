If we accept that the set of "natural rights" is fixed, then by asking for more rights (for yourself), you are in fact arguing for more restrictions (on others). I have long argued that spam is tresspass and theft of service, but I have stopped arguing for legislation because I recognize that it is futile. Your actions against telemarketers are successful because both you and the telemarketer are within the same jurisdiction and tort law exists to support your action.  But try to apply the same tort concept against some Chinese spam generator (or Korean, or Romainian, ad infinitum) and you will quickly see that the global nature of the internet renders regional tort law moot. I keep a loose track of the spam I receive (typically >50/day) and a good 85% originates offshore, even though the benefiting party may be domestic. Enacting tort law will simply drive the remaining 15% offshore, and the benefiting parties will just argue that they have been Joe-jobbed.
The problem is that the present email structure was designed for a more naive time when all parties were trusting and trusted.  The solution *is* a technical one. We must build fences against the tresspassers, but inevitably some will sneak through.  If you want to receive email, you will have to deal with email.

The multi-layered approach is the way to go.  Your home-rolled layer probably wouldn't be able to call 911 for you, at least not without tipping your hand.  Most places, the police require a formal agreement before they will respond to automated alarms, and some departments simply won't. But it could notify you of an invasion and archive the surveillance videos to a remote site.  At least you'd know you'd been compromised and could take appropriate steps.

@_subject: Re: [cta@hcsin.net: Re: CNN: 'Explores Possibility that Power 
It's not just the reliance on Windows that's scary.  It's the mindset of the industrial controls industry, where the concept of security is percieved as a hassle for the end customer, and therefore something to be avoided.
10 years ago, I was developing a data collection and reporting program for the aircraft industry. The project suffered from creeping featurism, and one of the desired features was adding dialup data exchange, so the collection apps could send their data to a central location via modem.  When I asked how much security was wanted on the dialup port, I was told that none was necessary because no one would ever attack the system, and anyway, the data were not interesting to outside parties.  10 years ago, perhaps that was an understandable position, though certainly naive.  (I still put in a minimal challenge/response layer, if only to discourage the C-64 kids with A few weeks ago, I sat in on a meeting to talk over design of a TCP/IP Ethernet interface for an existing control system.  When I asked what security provisions were envisioned for this interface, I was told that the system was not intended for deployment on publicly routed network segments, so there was no need for any security protocol.
I've just returned from an extensive training seminar on OPC controls technology.  The acronym stands for "OLE for Process Control", and it's a Microsoft-centric technology built on top of DCOM.  Agt the lower end, OPC would let you control a PLC from Excel.  Given the compressed schedule of the course (normally three weeks, it was compressed to two for our class) and my previous experiences, I didn't try to discuss security at all.  But I noticed no authentication layer at all.  Apparently, the security Microsoft natively provides for controlling DCOM traffic is all that such an application has available.  And as far as I can tell, that would be none.
I suppose I do get a bit of entertainment from the looks on the engineers' faces when I bring up threat models and attack scenarios.  Most of them are indifferent.  Some are confused.  Some are annoyed.  And one or two have understood the threat, but told me that I shouldn't talk to corporate about such things because it would make the sales force nervous.
The reactions of sales droids (and even management) has been either dismissive (there is no threat) or hostile (I'm the threat).  The most entertaining episode was back when UPS was first deploying their DIAD electronic clipboard, and I asked what steps were being taken to protect the signature data in transit. (There was no protection at all; the signature data were retained in the clear and could be dumped by any device that knew the protocol. I believe this is still the case.)  That eventually produced a regional manager who visited the small company where I was employed.  He was visibly irritated that anyone would even ask about such things, and answered every threat scenario I presented with "That would never happen!"  He stalked off in a huff after I asked him how he would feel if his digitized signature, obtained legitimately when he received a package, were to appear at the bottom of an incriminating document faxed to his general manager.
Ironically, several of my jobs have included IT duties along with my usual engineering tasks.  Those same sales droids and engineers that scoffed at the need for security in their industrial controls applications came running to me frantically when their workstations became infected with SirCam or Klez.
Security, as Schneier says, is a process.  It's also a mindset, and I think one either has the mindset or he doesn't.  And for those that don't have it, it is *very* difficult to impart.

After all, arent more and more POTS long-distance calls being routed over IP?  The only difference, really, is the point at which audio is fed to the codec.  If the codec is in the central office, it's a "voice" call.  If it's in the handset or local computer, it's VOIP.  I think we can count on the Ashcroftians to eventually notice this and pounce upon the opportunity.

After googling up some references, it seems the Major made a small misstatement.  Green appears to have proven that for any number N greater than 1, there are an infinite number of prime progressions where the primes are separated by N.  For example, 3,5,7 are all primes differing by 2.  The _Science_ article is behind their paid-subscription wall, so I can't look at the source, but  talks a bit about the general subject.

I believe they went a bit over a kilometer at Defcon (against a knowing volunteer, so they say) from a hotel rooftop.
The rest sounds perfectly plausible, as well.  WEP is Swiss cheese, guys tell their girlfriends too much and girlfriends gossip amongst themselves.
Nothing to see here.  Move along.

Re: the embedded item:
Just out of curiosity, if the man doesn't need a warrent to place a surveilance device, shouldn't it be within your rights to tamper with, disable or remove such a device if you discover one?  By extension, is there a business opportunity for bug-sweeping?  Either a storefront or a properly equipped pickup truck with bright signage.  (oh, yeah... I'm sure *that* would go over well with the Powers That Be)

Why run a DNS server?  Cache expiry would still require some lookups.  Just pre-populate your hosts file before your transmission sortie.
I need to look into whether mixminion tolerates casual connections.  ISTR incoming connections are checked against the local key cache, but I'm not sure if that includes the known address of the node.

If we can also assume that you perform this update over a secure
connection, then (also assuming the secure protocol used is intact) no one
outside of the identity server can see the contents of the session.  The
update protocol should also perform basic protective steps, such as making
all traffic of uniform size, using good-quality randomness for padding and
the like.
Essentially, you *can't* prevent Mallory the Evil Admin from doing 'sudo
cat /dev/kmem > chump_dump.img'.  So you need to tune your threat model
accordingly.  You face two attack surfaces: your connection to the
identity server (which is probably defendable) and the server itself
(which, if we posit local hardware access by Mallory and Co., is toast and
he already knows you are Number 268).
I'd think the method of choice would be to intermediate the update
process.  If updates can be done with an encrypted blob in an email, you
can use the remailer networks and Tor to break the connection between
"you" and "268" so Mallory only knows that someone with the right keys is
updating 268.  Even if direct connections are necessary, a Tor session
should help by making sure that updates to 268 always come from different
IPs. Even if it's only a describable set of exit nodes, all Mallory knows
is that 268 is Tor-literate.
But overall, if you don't trust the admin crew, how do you trust the
server itself?  And should you even be placing your credentials in its
care in the first place?

I'm really surprised that license plates aren't already explicitly machine-readable.  How hard would it be to overprint a barcode that only shows up when scanned with IR?  No OCR problems, and you still get the "advantages" of a passive tracking system, except more

Sweet syphillitic Jeebus!  I have *got* to stop glossing over the stuff in comp.encryption.general.  I saw a bunch of items on this go by, but didn't see the MLAT mentioned in the headlines.  (maybe RSS isn't all that great?)
Note that the MLAT is actually between the US and Canada, and according to  it's been in effect since Jan. 24, 1990.  So while Hushmail is pwned, it's pwned by Canada, which is in turn pwned by the US.  But then, a difference which makes no difference isn't really a difference.  I'm just glad I never used/trusted Hush.

From the page 1 free preview:
This sounds a lot like Intel's 'Personal Server' concept that floated 7 or 8 years ago.  Peripherals used Bluetooth or some other near-field tech to communicate.  Supposed to be about as big as an old-school Walkman.  IIRC, it never got beyond the concept stage.

I've often heard that a rechargeable debit card is a useful tool for maintaining financial privacy.  But I looked at a number of such cards today, and all of them require an activation procedure that involves disclosing name, address and SSN.  Has the market closed ranks on KYC, or are there still cards that can be charged without associating with a meatspace identity?

Second-generation?  Man, do I feel old!
Detweiler's rantings may not be fully accurate, but they do serve to outline the basic ideas of pseudonymity.  They're worth a visit, if only for some historical perspective.
As well, Tim May's Cyphernomicon has some good info about reputation Cory Docterow calls reputation capital "Whuffie", and goes into some detail on how it might work (assuming a slightly sci-fi infrastructure in the bargain).
Even without Docterow's Whuffie meter, repcap exists today. There are quite a few nyms that I trust to be reputable, even though I've never met them in person and don't know their True Names.
Welcome to the Other Plane.

I don't think so.  Anonymity means having no traceable connection to an identity.  Reputation requires that a series of communications be traceable back to some unique entity.  This is the classic Detweiler 'nymity' argument.  Reputation not tied to a meatspace identity must be tied to a persistent pseudonym.  Otherwise, no reputation capital accrues.
Hey, it's great to relive the classics! :)
