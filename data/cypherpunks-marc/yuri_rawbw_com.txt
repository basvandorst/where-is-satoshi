This actually depends on what to mean by "Tor". If just the network level part, then yes. But tor project also provides and promotes TBB, which attempts to prevent various client side exploits and web app attacks, but apparently can't prevent all of them. If tor project went one step further, and developed security-by-isolation approach (using virtual machines, like Whonix does), this could prevent practically all client side exploits. And pretty much the only way user could be deanoned is if he himself typed in his personal information, or logged into some service shared with other identities.

Binaries from the unreputable source are a security risk, and shouldn't be used. No instructions can normally lead to reproducing of the binary-equivalent files. They should distribute the code that can be It is the Windows culture to directly distribute binaries. This is the vector of propagation of viruses and trojans. Additionally, such executables from SF aren't signed, and can be subject to MITM attacks like Evilgrade

The OP was primarily concerned about other countries.
