@_subject: business cards 
I've got a problem with doing business cards in OOo Writer.  I select Avery (Letter Sized) 5371 and the format of the page is way off.  The left margin is .75 and the right margin is .01; my cards are getting cut off on the right side.  Does anyone else encounter this problem?
