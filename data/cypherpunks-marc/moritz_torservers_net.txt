@_subject: Visualization: Tor nodes on Google Maps and Google Earth 
I wrote a small ugly Python script to visualize Tor relays on Google
Maps and Google Earth. You can see the result here:
* Open KML file in Google Maps:
* Download tormap.kml for Google Earth
The KML standard is being pushed by Google and should work for
OpenStreetMap, too, but I couldn't get it to load there. Feel free to
modify the script to generate other outputs.
The initial idea was to scale the marker size to show the relay's
bandwidth, but Google Maps does not support this.
The markers might give a false impression of accuracy. Most IPs can only
be tracked to city level (or even region), ie. the markers are somewhat
near, not necessarily at the real location of the relay.
You can download the script here:
 (LGPL)
This is a one-time snapshot and I will not update it regularly, unless
there is public interest to do so. The bandwidth categories are based on
the reported "observed bandwidth" at the time of creation, so the actual
number of high bandwidth nodes will fluctuate every time the script is
run. It would be nice to extend this script to use longer-term bandwidth
calculation like TorStatus does, and to generate a map over time using
all the consensus data provided at  An
example of what this could look like is Vis4Net's Wikileaks Mirror World
Map at  .

@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Secure email with limited usable metadata 
Thank you for raising this topic once again. Toying with the idea of
"better" email for quite some time, I think there's direct and practical
things you can offer,
See  for a small prototype script that
rejects non-PGP mail. Exim seems to have the configuration option for
that somewhat built-in.
I'd go further and forward mail from the mx to hidden services
configurable by the user.
I'd maybe want to limit the amount of email a user can *send* in a given
time span.
I would not want to use VPS for a service like this.
Working on something like it.
Torservers.net is currently a project under a German non-profit. In
Germany, ever email provider with more than 10k users has to provide
lawful interception.
I'd like to see a full design for it first, and then the components, and
the configuration for each component, so this is easy to set up and
replicate by anyone. For example, how do I configure Postfix to relay
certain incoming mail to a configured hidden service, how do I make it
so it only rejects non-PGP mail for some accounts, etc.

@_subject: [liberationtech] A Public Statement Regarding Ubiquitous Encryption on the XMPP Network 
Reply-To: Jabber/XMPP software development list Almost 15 years have passed since my friend Jeremie Miller released
the initial version of the jabberd IM server, launching the Jabber
open-source community and the technology we know today as XMPP. Yet,
all that time, hop-by-hop encryption using SSL/TLS has been optional
on the XMPP network. A number of server operators and software
developers in the XMPP community have decided that needs to change for
the better. Based on discussions at the XMPP Summit last week in
Portland, Oregon, I have drafted a plan for upgrading the XMPP network
to always-on, mandatory, ubiquitous encryption. You can find it here:
In short: we owe it to those who use XMPP technologies to improve the
security of the network (and thanks to Thijs Alkemade, we now have
better ways to test such security, using the newly-launched "IM
Observatory" at xmpp.net). Although we know that channel encryption is
not the complete answer, it's the right thing to do because it will
help to protect people's communications from prying eyes.
If you or your organization develop XMPP-compatible software or run a
service that's connected to the XMPP network, I encourage you to sign
the statement by following the instructions in the README at the URL
shown above.

@_subject: [tor-talk] USB Sticks for TAILS 
I know there is a dedicated mailinglist for TAILS, but I figured I would
reach a larger audience here, and it might be of interest to many who
are not subscribed to the TAILS list.
Ideally, you use TAILS from a read-only medium. CD is best, but many
devices these days don't have an optical drive, and handling CDs is not
as convenient as a USB stick.
For quite some time, people kept recommending the TrekStor CS USB stick
[  ], one of the
few sticks available in Germany with write-protection switch. Turns out
they use a new firmware, and now don't support booting from it in
read-only mode. The company confirmed this via email.
There are roughly no alternatives, and I figured I'm not the only one
looking for USB sticks with write protection switch. Via alibaba.com, a
"wholesale Chinese ebay", I contacted various Chinese suppliers, and
ended up ordering two samples. Even there, the selection of sticks with
write protection is very limited.
I ended up paying paying 60 for the 2 samples because of shipping and
Western Union fees.
The sticks are not very fast, but acceptable, and boot in read-only
mode. They are not as slim as I hoped for, but the supplier is friendly,
production and shipping was very fast. (less than 2 weeks altogether).
Logo printing is cheap ($0.15 per stick), so to try the quality I also
had them print a logo on the samples.
I am still undecided whether I want the final sticks to have a logo, or
simply be blank to not attract too much attention. If you have a nice
idea for a logo, let me know. I want to order 100 sticks in time for
Chaos Communication Congress 30C3. The production cost is $4 per stick
(8GB), the final price (taxes, GEMA, shipping) will likely be around $15.

That's why you need to "wrap" it, as described in the link? -- Exactly
because otherwise anyone can (un)set this.
