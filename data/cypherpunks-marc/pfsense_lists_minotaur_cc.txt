Indeed, we have Ubiquiti kit running point to point links in the 5Ghz unlicensed spectrum (band C) over around 18km which deliver ~65Mbps throughput. I think our distance record is just shy of 68km.
Do check the 24Ghz spectrum rules carefully in your jurisdiction - certainly here in the UK the 24Ghz unlicensed spectrum is limited, and only allows fairly low power without a licence.
I'd add Motorola Orthogon kit to that list, based on some offshore experience with it a few years ago.
Kind regards,

I believe there were discussions about 18 months ago to the effect that a w=
eakness (cryptanalysis rather than brute force) had been discovered in SHA1=
, so going up to SHA512 can't be a bad thing.
You might want to look at RIPEMD160 (and derivatives) as well - very differ=
ent development model from SHA derivatives, which you may or may not find m=
ore comforting.
What made you change from AES to Blowfish, and is there any evidence to sug=
gest that Blowfish is more 'secure' than AES?
It's worth mentioning here that AES acceleration is well supported in hardw=
are (even low-power platforms like the ALIX embedded boards have AES accele=
ration), whereas Blowfish will likely be done entirely in software.
pfSense is, essentially, a very well put together collection of other packa=

ther those other packages which make up the security portions of pfSense (p=
f, OpenVPN, even FreeBSD itself) are themselves secure. Those are probably =
questions better aimed at the developers of those packages.

Who is this MI4 of whom you speak? :-)
In very broad terms, UK to USA equivalents would be as follows:
GCHQ = NSA
MI5 = FBI (though the FBI has a much wider remit)
SIS (sometimes erroneously referred to as MI6) = CIA
There have been attempts to do similar in the UK, but ISPA (our industry body) has fought pretty hard against it. It seems to have died for now, but I've no doubt that future governments (or home secretaries) will try and resurrect it at every possible opportunity.
Kind regards,
