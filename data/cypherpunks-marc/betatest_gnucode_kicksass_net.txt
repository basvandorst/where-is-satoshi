The RPMs are getting QA no matter what, otherwise they would never get
released. For the RHEL beta, the are no errata notices, packages just
appear on the channel. The RHL beta could be the same. I'm not
suggesting the beta rpms go through the same process as the "released"
rpms, only that they are put on the channel. But everyone seems opposed
to that for some reason.
I guess I'm not understanding the difference in the beta process for
RHEL vs RHL. A beta is a beta, no matter what name you put on it.
I didn't say "let's put rawhide on RHN," only the relevant packages that
have a bugfix applied and need to be tested. I don't see how it defeats
the purpose of RHN. RHN is a quick easy way for me to 1) get updated
packages, 2) add packages to a running system. Just because this is a
beta does not make those funtions less useful.

I have *NEVER* stated I bought entitlements for the beta. I purchased
them for a released version. Besides, RHN would be a great way for RH to
notify the beta testers a BUGFIX has been applied to a package. Then we
could all quickly and easily get it and test it.
Having to add myself to the CC list on every bug report in Bugzilla just
so I can stay informed of the status of a bug is time consuming, and a
poor method of passing information in my opinion.
The other thing I keep forgetting to mention is updates are only 50% of
what up2date can do. I use it all the time to add new packages to my
currently running install. It's nice, because it solves deps for me, and
I don't have to dig out the cds and figure out which cd has the package
I need. And, because it is included, I don't have to run over to Fedora
or Freshrpms and get apt or yum, and configure them for what I want.
The current "add/remove applications" program is badly broken, and is to
restrictive of what I can install. If RH had just put the rpms on the
channel, I probably never would have started this thread.

I do understand the term "beta." But, I thought this beta was in feature
freeze already, so it has a specific group of packages. Is my thinking
incorrect? The process of getting packages to RHN is bound to be
automated, so, why would it be so hard to populate the channel? So, what has happened to the RHLP website? It was up all of 3-4 days
before it went away. I read something about problems with the server. It
must be a hell of a problem to take this long to restore. If one of my
servers was down this long, I would get fired. :)
Well, "waste" may have been a poor choice of words, but I try not to
make a habbit of giving away my money without getting something in
return.

Hmmm... I think this bothers me the same as "it's not supported." Tell
me there haven't been any updated packages for the beta release, can
With the RHLP, what guarantee do I have that those releases will have
channels on RHN? "It's a community project, and it's unsupported,"
remember? I guess if I want the warm fuzzy feeling, I will have to
purchase RHEL-WS.
Because I don't always run betas, and I like having an entitlement for
each machine. Not to mention it sends a few $$ a year to Red Hat.

Actually, no. But I am sick and tired of wasting my personal time (which
I have very little of) reading longwinded posts from blow hards like you
who think they are so much smarter, and have more to offer than everyone
else. Quit making this a personal matter. I am allowed to feel as I wish
whether *YOU* like it or not!

Pretty darn close.
It would be a nice benefit, but I certainly don't expect RH to give me
anything. I just would like to be able to use what I have, and to know
for sure I will be able to continue to use it in the future.

This conversation is going no where.. We should just forget I asked a
question. I almost didn't send my original message in the first place
because I had a feeling this is the type of thread it would turn into.
People seem to be reading between the lines instead of reading what I
actually wrote. I really didn't want to have a debate.
If I can download the software from RHN, I should be able to get the
updates from RHN as well. This my opinion and I'm sticking to it.
I'm tired of hearing "it's not supported." I didn't ask for "support," I
just asked why the updates for Severn weren't available from RHN, while
the updates for Taroon are. And, so far, I received an answer from
everyone but a Red Hat employee (well, not everyone, but you get the
I am also concerned that I will not be able to use the remainder of my
subscription on the next release of RHL. That would force me to keep my
systems at RH9, or quit using my entitlements, which will cost me money.
I guess I will re-install my "supported" product, quit making an effort
to contribute to the community, and go on about my business...

What I can't stress enough is the fact updates for the RHEL beta are
already in RHN. A beta is a beta, be it RHEL or RHL. So if RH is going
to release updates for one beta on RHN, why can't they do it for the
other beta as well?
As a home user, I don't really have any "production systems." I could
care less if I blow them up or not. I am stuck administering windows at
work, so, I like coming home and playing with my linux machines. Kind of
a hobby you might say.
I have 2 basic entitlements (not demo, I paid money) for my 2 home
machines. AFAIK, basic entitlements are targeted at the home user. So,
if I run a beta on 1 of my 2 systems, an entitlement is automatically
being wasted.
Everyone seems to be saying I can't use the tools I "purchased" if I
want to run the betas. So, if I don't want to throw away my money, don't
beta test. That attitude does not make me feel very welcome in the
development community.
Doesn't that contradict what the RHLP is trying to achieve, community
participation? Just my $0.10... :|

Well, that's not exactly what I said, but you are right, the whole fun
in testing beta stuff is seeing just how badly you can break things.
I guess the RHN thing is kinda political to me. I paid for a
subscription, but during the time I'm beta testing, the entitlement
isn't being used for anything. But, the expiration day stays the same no
matter what. That just doesn't seem fair to the paying subscriber who
wants to run the betas. Especially since the taroon updates are already
in RHN.
This is starting to resemble bitching, so I'll shut up..  :)

It's so cool there are all these rawhide repositories for yum and apt

entitlements for RHN. The clock is ticking to renewel time...
Anyhow, thanks to everyone for the suggestions...

Thanks for the reply Robert...
I guess I'll keep my eye out for the little red dot in the corner of my
screen then. This has actually been a really stable beta for me. I have
only been bitten once, by the ACPI/intel E100 bug, which was easily
worked around. I mainly asked because the updates are pouring out for
taroon, which I am also running.
I always look forward to downloading ~2GB of data. Makes my hardware
earn its keep. :)
I am mostly a home user, with the exception of a network management
machine I play with at work, so, I really don't have any "production"
systems. I purchased a couple entitlements to keep my home network
updated, and to contribute a few $$ to Red Hat. I have yet to find a
distro I like as much. Thanks for all the hard work everyone!

Please pardon me if I missed a thread about this, but, is everyone
updating out of rawhide? Is redhat planning to populate the rhn severn
channel with packages anytime in the near future? I feel like I'm
wasting my entitlements while running the beta.
