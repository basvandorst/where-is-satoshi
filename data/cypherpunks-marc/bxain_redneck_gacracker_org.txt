I don't think that's necessarily a good idea.  It would eliminate or
reduce the anonymous remailer's usefulness for posting to newsgroups and
mailing lists.
Add to that the concept of some anonymous remailer users being
informants or corporate whistle-blowers, who will often be contacting
law enforcement or media officials and won't have access to public keys
for encryption.
Instead, it would be a good idea for remailers to find some other means
of filtering spam.  There are some great tools out there that might be
useful for this, such as nilsimsa.

In fact, spammers currently *do* send mail encrypted to the remailers'
keys.  It's a pain in the ass trying to filter the damn stuff out.

Hmmm I have an idea about this.  What if remailer C doesn't get to
cash in on his tokens unless delivery to remailer D can be confirmed?
Or maybe there is some other way to cut down on cheating.
