Excuse my but I have the same problem with an SONY SDX-460V with 40-104 Gb
tape (AIT-1 Turbo).
I think since last linux update, backup stop working with the same error:
These dumps were to tape DailySet101.
*** A TAPE ERROR OCCURRED: [[writing file: Input/output error]].
Some dumps may have been left in the holding disk.
Run amflush to flush them to tape.
The next tape Amanda expects to use is: DailySet101.
I tried with the cleaning tape but I got the same result.
Could be the linux update who began the problem?
