A four-year-old Catholic boy was playing with a four-year-old Protestant
girl in a children's pool in the backyard.  They splashed each other, got
very wet and decided to take their wet clothes off. The little boy looked at
the little girl and said, "Golly, I didn't know there was that much
difference between Catholics and Protestants."
A guy sits down in a Cafe' and asks for the hot chili. The waitress says,
"The guy next to you got the last bowl.¡± He looks over and sees that the
guy's finished his meal, but the chili bowl is still full. He says, "Are you
going to eat that?¡± The other guy says, "No. Help yourself.¡± He takes it
and starts to eat it. When he gets about half way down, his fork hits
something. He looks down sees a dead mouse in it, and he pukes!the chili
back into the bowl. The other guy says, "That's about as far as I got, too."
