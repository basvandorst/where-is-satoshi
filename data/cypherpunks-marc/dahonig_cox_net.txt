Old money is analogue, and therefore decays in a gradual
fashion.  The Treasury (via the banks) culls fading bills.
An RFID would be digital and would fail catastrophically.
This is an important difference.
[Moderator's note: enough on the RFID now. It is far away from crypto. -Perry]

Wouldn't a crypto coder be using paranoid-programming skills, like *checking* that the memory is actually zeroed? (Ie, read it back..)  I suppose that caching could still
deceive you though?
I've read about some Olde Time programmers
who, given flaky hardware (or maybe software), would do this in non-crypto but very important apps.

even before e-commerce, the real When I buy $20 of gas with non-bearer credentials (ie, credit card), the vendor does a real-time check on me.  Seems fair/useful to be able

The DNS is like the Yellow Pages phonebook.  A secure DNS would prevent
evil postmen from editing your copy of the Yellow Pages before he drops it
off at your house. But *anyone* can buy an entry in the Yellow Pages.  And you can't
sue the Yellow Pages because of an advert there --even a signed (unedited)
Adding PKeys to Yellow Pages merely lets you get scammed *confidentially*.
Verisign doesn't help ---they don't check anything in meatspace.  They're
not liable.  You can't sue them.  "Kosher meat certified by that vegetarian catholic up the street"
You need a Better Business Bureau's cert,  where the BBB is financially
liable.  (This implies it checks in *meatspace* and probably implies competition too.)
Another metaphor: you can't sue the DMV if someone defrauds you using
a fake-ID.  You can't sue the DMV even if its a valid ID.  You can't
get your money back if the valid ID points to someone who is no longer
bound to that name & location.
And getting scammed by whispering doesn't help either.
On the other hand, if reputation is all that matters, you can conduct
business without a fixed IP, DNS record, or Verisign, by transacting on a public bulletin board (skywriting), using only signatures to maintain the
rep (and provide confidentiality when exchanging credit card info).
There's a bootstrap
problem of building reps, and getting others to believe them, but Pkeys
let you maintain all the *identity* you need.

As spam mitigation, it might work better than
hashcash.  As cash, it lacks the anonymity of "bearer-documents (tm)" since there is one
clearing house.  This might be improved via
support for a system of mostly independent
clearing houses which also interchange at interchange places.  However, those would likely
be regulated by the Powers That Be, ergo not
alleviating my concerns about anonymity.

@_subject: Re: Intel to also add RNG 
Obviously there are costs associated with a HW RNG as someone enumerated.  Since Intel
can no doubt shut it off when not used, it is free.  And die authors
are always looking for more content to add.  (And obviously to this
list, without crypto tools the net is worse than useless, its deceptively
reliable :-)  So crypto hw will continue to be increasingly useful.)
Since the crypto cluefull would never use a single raw RNG of any kind,
and would even seek to use multiple diverse conditioning algorithms, cpu bandwidth allowing, a "hw" source can only help.
(Unless they were implementing something useless like DRM)
Except as someone wrote, if its the devil's hwrng, or can be clandestinely
switched into that mode as useful.

Frankly ridiculuous, JA must realize that only ideological motivations are
robust enough for his purposes.  Actually, religion would be sufficient
motivation as well, but all the clueful are atheists.
One must have a day job, semiretired architect, say, so that one can pursue
one's own noble ideals.  Mozart had to tutor and perform and otherwise sell
his time so he could do what he wanted.  I won't speculate on JA's personal
finances but intelligent people capable of controlling their environment
are always valuable.
I'll mention Gilmore and May as examples of selfish-atruistic-techsaints.
Young and Assange will be discussed this way, one day. On the Daniel <---> JA axis of access-to-leaks I look forward to those more
brazen than JA who don't bother with protecting (US) Collaborators and
other collateral damage.  Daniel, by offering material only to MSM, is a
distraction.  If MSM were adequate there would be no niche for cryptome, WL, or Daniel's
honeypot.  WL's current trickle is a disgrace.  Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

A long time ago I bought a geiger counter for crypto exploration.  Problem is, you can't buy rad sources strong enough to generate enough entropy (which is *still* subject to conditioning of course, despite the hype, and any way a GM tube will saturate..).  Even if you take your smoke detector apart and use an alpha-windowed tube.
But a detuned FM radio card seemed to do quite well.  Admittedly, no white vans driving my amps.  Are these sources not supported as entropy sources?   (Pardon my linux randomness being out of date)

A number of public reviews of DPR's infosec mistakes have been published.
I think a strong solution to the 'tackled in library' defects would be to have:
1) program to notice his magic bracelet is not near
2) program to notice that vid cam is not a head but a chaotic scene
 is particularly easy without extra hardware (ca. 2015)  You'll have to switch it off when you

And of course, things like 'back to wall facing forward' would have been helpful.
Claustophilia is a useful trait.
