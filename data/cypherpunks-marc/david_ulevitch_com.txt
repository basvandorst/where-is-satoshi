I think this is only true if you run your BGP session on a different
path (or have your provider pin down a static route).  If you are
using BGP and run it on the same path, the 100Gbps will cause massive
packet loss and likely cause your BGP session to drop which will just
move the attack to another site, rinse / repeat.  I don't think very
many people run BGP over a separate circuit, but for some folks, it
might be appropriate.
I also recommend folks anycast with a /22 or /23 and then use BGP for
the /23 or /24 announcements and have their provider pin down the /22
at a few sites so that if all hell breaks loose and the /23 or /24 is
flapping and being dampened then you still have reachability with the
covering prefix.  It also lets you harden and strengthen a few smaller
sites that have the /22 statically pinned down.  I'm not sure if
people think the "cost" of doing this is worth it, jury still out for
But as you and others have pointed out, not a lot of defense against
DDoS these days besides horsepower and anycast. :-)
