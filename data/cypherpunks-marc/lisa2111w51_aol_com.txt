@_subject: CASH IN YOUR PAYPAL TOMORROW!!                                                      6139-4 
I could use a FREE $20,000 loan, could you ??
Follow the very simple instructions below and in
a few days you should have around $20,000
as the response rate will be HUGE due to the tiny
investment required and the MASSIVE
potential. We believe the return rate is
currently as good as 70% !
You could do this as often as you liked, I'll
explain how simple it is.
Log into your paypal account, and send $10 dollars to:
NEXT DUE : :-   shayneman
Who is currently the next person in line. "service" as payment type and put "Donated"
in the subject line.
You can open a paypal account (AND get a $5 bonus
for doing it !) at
Next, move this address:
PENDING  1:-   cherishangel1
up into the "NEXT DUE" slot Now Move This Address:
     PENDING 2:-  lm88013
To "PENDING 1" Slot and put your own
e-mail address into the "PENDING 2" slot.
Now send the mail to as many prospects as you
possibly can. Having done this once,
you'll see how easy it is. ONLY SEND money to the first
person on the list. And DON'T cheat ! If Your Attempt to move your Name Up To The Top it will not work. You may get a few dollars But You will not get anywhere near as much as is possible when the rules are followed, it also cheats others out of their due money.
Now here is a great Tip:  send through bulk email services or Paid  To Read Email Lists! Many paid to read email lists allow free member ads. You can find some great deals of one time mailings at bulk mail services. And you can find Some pretty large Opt-In mailing lists that allow you to send email for free every seven days. These are lists that you do not have to send yourself. They are sent through the
List providers server. They are not illegal and not considered SPAM as all have opted/agreed to recieve emails. If you find enough of them to send to You could possibly send out to over 30,000 prospects! and let's say you get a low 2% response rate from those 30,000. That's still a heck of alot more then what you put into it! Then those 2% that responded send out another 30,000 with your name in number 2 and they get a 2% response, then those 2% send out another 30,000 emails with only 2% response! That's 90,0000 emails sent to prospects by the time you are in 1st place!
With only 3 names in your branch you can expect
it to happen VERY quickly !
but you KNOW you will
get your 10 dollars back !!
That's only ONE reply from around 25000 with your
name in "NEXT DUE", isn't it ?
What would happen if you mailed 35,000 prospects ?
You can do this again, and again, and
AGAIN, DO NOT CHEAT. IF YOUR "BRANCH" is BROKEN
YOU WONT
GET ANYTHING NEAR THE RETURN !!
This is not a chain letter. You can refer to
title 18, Section 1302 of the
Postal and Lottery Code.
     $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  TESTIMONIALS :- My Second go at it! Last try I got a whopping $10,745. Thats sending out 35,000 emails! I'm sooo excited. Just wish more people would give it a try, then how much would we get??? Wow, boggles the mind.
