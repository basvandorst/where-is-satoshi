Just to remind you of the arguments already known and voiced here
even more often:  to "freely make their own decisions" is possible
IFF there is no one exerting force (absence of a law, and the fall of
the CBDTPA may help in this respect) AND people have alternatives
to choose from.  The latter may not be the case in several years
from now, CBDTPA or not.  If you only can buy TCPA boards and your favourite OS will only run your favourite content when some TCPA microkernel is provably running, how's that compatible with free
decisions?  (No, I cannot build my own mainboard, sorry.)
Do you really think the industry will ask the average user whether he wants a TCPA-enabled board or not?  Do you really think the average user will even understand the question?
Driving a car is not an option if the supermarket is 50 miles from
your home and there's no bus station.
