This may also not quite do what you think:
 1) burn_stack() may reasonably be made tail-recursive by a
sufficiently agressive compiler, if the memset is inlined and is then
recognized as a bunch of dead stores.
 2) even if it doesn't get tail-call treatment, some ABI's require
largeish alignment for stack frames or define a fixed component to the
stack frame and then don't fill in the unused stack slots; either of
these may leave a good size chunk of the stack unwritten.

One key point though: even if DNSSEC was deployed from the root, and a
trusted copy of the root key was the client, the search path/default
domain must *also* come from a trusted source.
Currently, default domain/search path often comes from DHCP, and for
nomadic laptops where the relationship to the local network is often
casual at best, this is likely to be a mistake.
