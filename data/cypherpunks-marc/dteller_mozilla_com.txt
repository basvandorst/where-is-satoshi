Actually, that's not true. Maybe you checked on B2G Desktop, which uses
a single process. On the real FirefoxOS, each app runs in its own
process, with the following exceptions:
- the browser UI (i.e. the url bar) is part of the system process;
- dialer, contacts and First Time use are three view of the same
Each process has a distinct uid.
Investigating the issue. I believe some work is needed here, but that
doesn't look too hard platform-wise.
What kind of leaks do you have in mind?
By default, that is correct. What would you suggest?
I know that the system can detect attempts to access the network by an
app, so I suspect that it wouldn't be too hard to fully deactivate
network access once the app is installed.

As a side-note, there is a will to make FirefoxOS very safe, but as far
as I know, very few people work on this actively at the moment. If you
are interested in contributing to this effort, I can try and find you a
good interlocutor.
