Unless I'm misunderstanding you, I find this hard to believe.
[Moderator's note: I find it easy to believe, because I see exactly
what he does on the networks I control. I don't know why you are
attacked less often. --Perry]
On my computer (DSL, fixed IP), which is pretty heavily monitored, I'm detecting only a few, maybe up to a dozen, actual attacks a day.  Most of them are from well-known root kits, targeting old vulnerabilities.  Sunrpc, lpr, imap, and anonymous ftp seem to be popular.  Most attacks come from Asia, eastern Europe used to be popular, but seems to have died down recently.
The only way I could get anywhere near your numbers is to count all of the Windows-based http attacks coming from automated worms and the like.
I'd be interested in hearing from others what kind and frequency of attacks they're experiencing.
This is of course true no matter what the frequency of attacks is.
