Way to rob Mr. Williams of his heritage, c&canon.   To reduce a human to
a skin color is deplorable.
What if we addressed you as "Yellow" Concern-troll instead of
Asian-American, or more specifically, Japanese-(country formally known
as Brazil)ian ?
Are you really that much of a commie ?
Is this one of those recursive things you FOSS activists are always on
about ?
With CO2 on the rise, the world is only getting greener, my dear.
Plenty of O2 to go around, or across, depending on your (((world view))).

I will bite.
Are these your words ?
    "It is past time for the racially oppressed to do
    what people who believe themselves to be 'white'
    will not do, put an end to the vectors of their
    destructive mythology of whiteness and their white
    supremacy system."
    "I'm fed the fuck up with self-identified 'white's'
    daily violence directed at immigrants, Muslim, and
    sexually and racially oppressed people.  The time
    is now to confront these inhuman assholes and end
    this now."
Not violence, if that is what you are fishing for.
Skin color as an identifier is an obfuscation of your true self.
"White", "Black", and "Brown" are all labels intended to dissolve
associations with your true identity: your ancestral past as a
Cuban and African, and your current identity, as an American.
Our world is a world made of nations, not colors.
Stop being racist, faggot.
