In reality it's a bit silly to try to mess with these rules if they are
n-years old. Based on the pics, simply requesting that all users use
bridges instead of bridges is the
easiest change that by-passes this specific set of rules. But, I
think it is more realistic that these minor points are moot and the
regexes were fixed long ago and that the ruleset more fully covers
Tor's distributors now.
This problem makes me sad on many levels, and I'm not opposed to
implementing mitigation techniques (within reason) based on the
rulesets, however we shouldn't do anything that will hurt our users nor
should be do anything that makes tor more difficult to use
(unfortunately this includes sending users bogus bridge addresses).
For the use-case of bridges, where a user tries to circumvent local
network interference and implicitly expects they're not fingerprinted
by NSA, we are mostly failing right now.

Censorship and network interference is exactly what we're trying to
prevent in this situation. Why would you want to prevent someone from
reaching their destination? We're interested in freedom (and providing
unrestricted access), not controling where users can and can not go.
