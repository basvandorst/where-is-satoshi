Dear eBay customer,
During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures,   we have detected a slight error in your billing information.
This might be due to either of the following reasons:
1. A recent change in your personal information ( i.e.change   of address).
2. Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up   process.
3. An inability to accurately verify your selected option of   payment due to an internal error within our processors.
Please update and verify your information by clicking the link below: If your account information is not updated within 48 hours   then your ability to sell or bid on eBay will become restricted.
Thank you
The eBay Billing Department .
