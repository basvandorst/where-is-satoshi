Unfortunately, the "newsmakers" have minimal effect in
the near term; the beauraucracies involved have
inertia to beat the the band. (two examples: 1) Reagan
killes the B1, so USAF created the Strategic Program
Office, same people, same building, same contracts -
when it was revived, renamed again to B1, same people,
same building, same contracts.  2) Congress said no
mor U2s, so USAF built TR-1s and didn't rename them to
the U2 designation until the contract was complete. Same plane.)

There is a significant difference between smart and
honest.  This method allows for blackmail to release
the encryption keys -- "We can't allow this to be
released until you prove that it is not Bad data, so
cough up the Keys to the Kingdom or we keep the
hardware." -- this method is especially helpful when
you don't have a good enough case for the punishment
to be "sufficient" and you need the extra fine of
harware and loss of income.
