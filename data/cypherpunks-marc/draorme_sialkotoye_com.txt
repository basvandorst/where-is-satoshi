The redneck replied, "Great! He already put me on a murder case!"
Fred was applying for a job as a flagman/switch operator on the railroad.
The chief engineer was conducting the interview. "What would you do if the
Northern Express was heading north on Track 1 and the Southern Central was
heading south on Track 1?" Fred quickly answered, "Well, I'd call my
brother." The chief engineer just sat there for a second. "Why would you
call your brother ?" "He's never seen a train wreck before." narikin3nakanosa02mizitaku,gijikika eirisei.
