Wait a minute... are you saying that a 'screen name' is not the same as an
Good Lord!

Speaking of securing military vehicles... I understand that most US fighter
jets are not equipped with self-starters.  This differs from, say, Sweden
and Finland, where fighters have self-starters, to facilitate quick takeoffs
from backwoods roads.
If the US were ever invaded, surely such independent operational ability
would be a good thing.
Perhaps the US has a greater fear of such vehicles going walkabout?
