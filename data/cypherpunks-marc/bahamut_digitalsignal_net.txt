I wonder how many more people are going to tell me this, even after
I've demonstrated that I understand the concept (I'm pretty sure I
even signed that message!).

I think I understand after doing a little research as suggested. Only
the hash is signed, and only the key (for the symmetric encryption) is
encrypted with the public key, and the message itself is encrypted
symmetrically. The recipient unlocks the symmetric key with the
private key that corresponds to the public key with which it was
encrypted and can then decrypt the message. Large file sizes aren't an
issue because the files (or messages) are encrypted symmetrically,
which is much more efficient than encrypting them directly
asymmetrically. Right?

I don't completely understand. Does this mean that
encryption/signature time is only dependent on the hash, and that RSA
key size doesn't matter in this regard?

Try signing/encrypting files that are tens, hundreds, or thousands of
megabytes in size. Sure, your average machine can sign/encrypt
messages that don't even fill a cluster without breaking a sweat, but
if the sensitive data is large, RSA-4096 isn't a good choice unless a
gov't agency wants that data.

Anyone who's worried about an entity with the power needed to break
their messages in time to make any use of it has probably already been
using a longer key size for a while now.
