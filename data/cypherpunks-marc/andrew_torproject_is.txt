Yes, I meant stop. When skynet achieves consciousness, the analysis of

So far, there is one story where Eva claims the NSA can break tor
easily, see this Tor and HTTPS graphic as proof:
If your adversary is any rumored global passive adversary that can watch
and record the entire Internet at once, then you've probably already
lost the game.
At PETS in 2009[0], Paul did a talk on 'why I'm not an entropist' and
suggested that people need to start working on defeating a mythical
global passive adversary. Maybe in the near future some government will
have the capability of being the global passive adversary.

: Sorry, no one on this list is going to help you get access to Silk Road.
More accurately, no one at Tor is going to help you otherwise we open
ourselves up to legal liabilities and other nonsense.
A lot of people email or call looking for help with accessing silk
road. We cannot help them due to the advice of our attorneys to never
help anyone doing something illegal in the US.
We have plenty of technical issues to solve. Adding legal challenges to
the list isn't a smart move.

These are based on real users with real stories. Not everyone wants

For those who do want to be public about it, we have those too. I

This is correct. We've refused donations and grants from organizations
that were sketchy enough to be worried, not aligned with our goals,
and/or one hop removed from something on the OFAC banned list[0]. On the other side, as a non-profit, we publish our donors and sponsors
both on our sponsor page[1] and in our financial reports[2]. We've never accepted bitcoin. We point bitcoin donators at other
organizations, see The EFF accepted bitcoins and then removed it. We chose not to fight
this battle[3].

I'm not sure what using a phone gets you for more verification. I
helped a domestic violence survivor get an AT&T GoPhone at the
local Best Buy for $20. Paid in cash, no identity needed, prepaid
service. They signed up for a google account via tor, used the phone
for the one sms message and then donated the phone to a homeless
I guess $20 is more than $1 for 1000 CAPTCHA breaks, but I guess that's
because the survivor isn't criminal minded enough to steal/clone
someone's phone for the sms message.

Hmm. I setup a tor hidden service on a tor client when I read this email

If someone is enumerating hidden services, whether its a relay or client
shouldn't matter.

Thanks for forwarding this Eugen. For the record, we have
The CCC or torservers are fine places to start. I've also directly
emailed William to offer help.
William will likely need an official letter from Tor stating his IP
address and exit relay was or was not an exit relay at the time in
question (which will be listed on the warrant). And he may need me to
formally describe Tor for either a lawyer, judge, or the police.
These are all steps we at Tor have taken before to help relay opers
support their cases.
