In about their FPDetective Framework
, the authors wrote
about Firegloves:
"Additionally, Firegloves limits the number of fonts that a single
browser tab can load and reports false dimension values for the
offsetWidth and offsetHeight properties of HTML elements to evade
JavaScript-based font detection. We evaluated the effectiveness of
Fireglovesâ as a countermeasure to fingerprinting, and discovered
several shortcomings. For instance, instead of relying on offsetWidth
and offsetHeight values, we could easily use the width and the height of
the rectangle object returned by getBoundingClientRect method, which
returns the textâs dimensions, even more precisely than the original
methods. This enabled us to detect the same list of fonts as we would
without the Firegloves extension installed. Surprisingly, our probe for
fonts was not limited by the claimed cap on the number of fonts per tab.
This might be due to a bug, or to changes in the Firefox extension
system that have been introduced after FireGloves, which is not
currently being maintained, was first developed. Although Firegloves
spoofs the browserâs user-agent and platform to pretend to be a Mozilla
Firefox version 6 running on a Windows operating system, the
navigator.oscpu is left unmodified, revealing the true platform.
Moreover, Firegloves did not remove any of the new methods intro-
duced in later versions of Mozilla Firefox and available in
the navigator object, such as navigator.mozCameras and
I add: OK, the naviagtor.oscpu issue can be fixed easily, but the
timezone feature doesnt't work too with enabled JavaScript.

Hi odinn,
mmh, today, i have compiled it under Ubuntu Trusty and it works with
Enigmail 1.7.2 without problems. The key search with dirmngr/gnutls
doesn't run (or i don't understand it), so i'm using GnuPG 2.0.X for it
as before. But imo, you need GnuPG 2.1 - with Enigmail - only, if you
want to use or try the new ECC keys.

@_subject: Re: What the dear NSA allegedly mean by "Mystic site"? 
MYSTIC is an ECI codename for a bunch of NSA SSO/TAO-TNT collection
sites or installations in foreign telephony provider networks (perhaps
corporate partner access with NSA NCSC), collecting telephony contents
and metadata in different countries:
ACIDWASH ?
DUSKPALLET (Kenia, TOPI:CIA)
ETCHINGSPIN ?
EVENINGEASEL (Mexico, TOPI:CIA)
LAUNDROMAT ?
PERMANENTPRESS ?
RANCIDRINSE ?
VENATOR (Philippines, with 5-Eyes partner ASD/Australia)
The "Sca..." is imo SCALAWAG, one of the SOMALGET class MYSTIC
collection sites/projects (the other SOMALGET's are BASECOAT, OILYRAG,

Oh yes. The NSA has the Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD) for that
purpose or for the establishment and management of Foreign Partner
Access (FPA) interception points/programms (for example RAMPART or
WINDSTOP or SMARAGD), local Special US Liaison Activities (SUSLAs)
like the one in Bad Aibling and Special US Liaison Offices (SUSLOs) for
the communication.
I think more or less. Besides the UKUSA 5-Eyes ring it is the question
for foreign partner services in which ring they are and so how close the
relationship is: 5Eyes, 9Eyes, 14Eyes (SIGINT Seniors Europe/SSEUR),
SIGINT Seniors Pacific/SSPAC, 30Eyes or 41Eyes.
I would say yes. Intelligence rings are intelligence exchange rings and
they are helping each other if laws preventing activities - one of the
last examples was
- or the operator clicks the right box in his GUI to pretend that his
action is compliant with the law ;)

I think no. But they provide soft- and hardware like XKS or
Wealthycluster systems and selectors via NSA's European Technology
Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden and the SUSLAG (NSA Special US Liaison
Activity Germany) in the Mangfall barrack (Bad Aibling).
(+UKUSA 5Eyes, CIA) and BND-TA. In the Snowden docs are two projects:
"Monkeyshoulder" (in Germany with NSA and GCHQ) and "Wharpdrive" (i
think foreign countries, 2013 exposed and than terminated). Than there
was "Eikonal" aka "Granat"/"Karat" (in Germany), "Glotaic" aka "Globe"
(with CIA in Germany) and now we know about "Smaragd" (outside the EU)
aside from nine additional blacked-out projects as seen in

Perhaps, i have missed something although i have read all available
pieces from Snowden/Greenwald, but except for two screenshots
 from the Citizen One video, more
"original" pictures of TUMULT, the stage0 component from the TURBULANCE
architecture, are never released by Snowden, Greenwald and the others.
