The point is, without this cosmic notion of trust, _I_ could walk into a bank
in semi-rurual Turkey and pull hundreds of dollars from YOUR credit card ac-
count. (Unless I was there during an earthquake, and all the telephone lines
were down and all I had was 20 USD, 10 million Turkish Lira, my passport, and
a copy of Knuth. )

True, attacks are usually carried-out by known and/or trusted individuals.
I suppose I was thinking more about key management on a theoretical level.
The infamous "rubber hose attack" still exists.  Once you really get down
to the real-world level, things begin breaking down. Identity theft is trivial
unless your proof of identity is always changing (e.g. SecureID), duplication
of that proof is made reasonably difficult (algorithmically, physically, how-
ever), and the proof itself is kept reasonably secure.  It appears that a lot
of work has to be done and a lot of money spent before even a small amount of
trust in an individual's proof of identity (on a world- or Internet-wide
scale) can be established.
