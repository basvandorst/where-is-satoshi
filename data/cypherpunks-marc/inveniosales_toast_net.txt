Dear Business Owner,
There are a number of companies across the country who have increased their sales through our electronic prospecting efforts. Instead of using the telephone to contact prospects they instead rely on our company to drive prospects to them.
Through email marketing, they were able to create a lead generation program that was effective as well as affordable.
We may be able to realize similar results for your company.  Please call or email myself for more information regarding your sales needs.
