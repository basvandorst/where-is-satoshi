IANAL, but this is not the same as the "regular" publication clause,
because that one is still a seperate (the german copyright law has
three parts - moral rights, economic rights and other rights.
yes, that is what I meant. except that the law as I read it does not
require a change. I don't think parody would violate it.
whoops. I mixed those up before.

@_subject: European Data Retention and Encryption for Dummies 
Hi everyone, I've been on this list before, but didn't have time for it
for a while. Now I'm back because I need some input:
You probably heard that the EU is currently passing data retention
laws. One part of them would require that ISPs keep logs of customer
traffic. It isn't entirely clear what exactly they need to store, but
the discussion goes into URL storage (i.e. what file on which virtual
host) and even full data storage (i.e. copies of the IP packets).
Obviously, at least the later is bullshit. However, it is absolutely
possible that it's just a smokescreen and the usual "compromise" will
be that the ISPs don't have to store the data except on request...
Enter a simple idea to solve the obvious privacy problem, at least in
parts. We do have the infrastructure in place to achieve end-to-end
encryption for the by far most-often-used web services, all we need is
to use it. I am, of course, talking about HTTPS and SMTPS.
Setting up apache so that it does HTTPS instead of HTTP, and all
requests to HTTP pages are redirected to a page pointing to the HTTPS
equivalent and explaining why is trivial.
Getting the various MTAs to use SMTPS isn't too difficult, either.
The problem with both is the need of SSL certificates. So I was
thinking of setting up a "Joe Doe's CA". A simple webpage where you can
request a certificate. It would do two check:
a) check if IP you are using is identical to the IP you are requesting
for, i.e. you'll have to ssh into your webserver and use lynx from
b) the certificate will be mailed to the admin-c of the domain you
requested it for (whois lookup).
This is not 100% secure, but then again how much checking does Verisign
really do on certificates? I believe this is "good enough" in that it
establishes a reasonable safety that you are talking to the right site,
at least much better than regular HTTP can offer.
The purpose of this is to get as many sites to switch to using HTTPS
and SMTPS as possible. Therefore, the required work must be kept
minimal. Once considerable parts of the internet traffic are encrypted,
they can pass as many data retention laws as they please.
Any comments? What did I miss? Where does this idea come apart? Does it
make sense at all?

speaking of unfiltered - I subscribed to ssz exactly because I don't
want to have anyone moderating for me. however, the spam volume is
is there a fee available that is filtered, but only for spam?

I guess you misinterpret the "morale rights" doctrine. not that I'm a
lawyer, but to my reading of the german copyright law, the morale
rights are thus:
- publication
  the creator can control if and how his work gets published. only he may
  cite from or describe his work in public as long as neither the work
  nor a description of it are published with his permission.
  (e.g. even the publisher can't leak stuff without the author's consent)
- credit
  the creator must be given proper credit, and he can choose if and
  what kind of credit (e.g. if he wants to use his real name or a
  pseudonym)
- defense against disfiguration (?)
  creator can fight against attacks on the integrity of his work,
  within limits.
  this is the complicated part. as I parse it, the intention was that
  if you, say, write a poem against communism and by some freak
  accident the communist party adopts it as their hymn, you can stop
  them from doing so (unless you enjoy the irony of it).
to me, the german copyright appears to take much more consideration of
the author, while the US copyright system is entirely economical in
nature. no surprise that the idea of "intellectual property" comes from
your side of the atlantic, it doesn't fit very well with most european
copyright doctrines.
that said, your original terms of copyright were more sensible - europe
has always had durations such as 70 years or "death + 50 years" and
other bullshit.
too bad the "new world order copyright" takes the bad from each,
instead of the good.

actually, as with most laws, the basic idea behind the "moral rights"
isn't that bad, it just got perverted.
if used differently, the "morale rights" part could well be used to put
a limit on the corporate abuse of copyright. for example, I could
envision an argument that an artist sues the RIAA for abusing his
copyrighted works for bogus lawsuits against P2P systems.

They're large and they have been around for quite a while.
