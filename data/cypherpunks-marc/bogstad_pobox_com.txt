A single data point on current DDOS traffic levels.
An Akamai press release says they handled DDOS attacks peaking at
14Gbps in the Nov. 30 to Dec 2nd time frame.
"The majority of attack traffic against the five retailers initiated
from distributed IP addresses out of Thailand, Mexico, Philippines,
and Brazil and reached peeks of up to 14 Gbps, with some websites
experiencing up to 10,000 times above normal daily traffic. "
