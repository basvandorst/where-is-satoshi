Bank Of Oklahoma Review Team Support
         Dear valued Oklahoma member:
It has come to our attention that your Oklahoma billing updates are
out of order. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your
online experience and update your billing records you will not run
into any future problems with the online service. However, failure
to update your records will result in account termination. Please  update your records by April 10th , 2005.
Once you have updated your account records your Oklahoma session will not be
interrupted and will continue as normal. Failure to update will result in
cancellation of service, Terms of Service (TOS) violations or future billing
Oklahoma Update Team
