Hi, Tim,
I'm glad that you have a bout of lucidity.
The government essentially won the crypto battle, marginalizing crypto
proponents, quietly getting media and corporations under control when
crypto is concerned, and generally rising the stakes. Those of you who
have access to corporate product development documents that relate to
communications know what I am talking about. CALEA etcl. It's there,
it's real and I think that about 5-10% of development resources are
taken by it.
Most cypherpunks were relatively highly paid engineers with
comfortable lives and some time on their hands, so while crypto was
fashionable it was cool to hang out at meetings and have pipe dreams
about taking on the state. Even then, scum like del Torto started to
bank ahead and sell to the "freedom fighters" and "good cops".
But then it got much worse. After the WTC theater, being present at
essentially anti-state meetings was not considered totally benign. And
also the salaries were gone, so this beer and TV Saturday alternative
suddenly stopped being alternative at all.
So we're back to the fact that highly paid engineers in crypto field
are really not automatically revolutionaries. On the contrary.
There are very few in the general population that are cut to be true
dissenters and act upon it. Now this age brings in the additional
requirement: they have to also be decent engineers. As a result, there
are very few left.

@_subject: Field improvised knives, FBI FTU, concealable weapons 
Re: Field improvised knives
I found the FTU's recent report on concealable weapons
( interesting,
but find that it omitted a few possibilities, viz:
1. The pop-top steel lid on a can e.g., of catfood forms a sharp
edge when removed.  (I have a permenant scar on a finger
attesting to this.)  If half the disc were grasped in a cloth
it could be more effective than several of the items you list.
2. Similarly, the steel lid on e.g., a tuna can forms a sharp (and
flatter, and slightly more rigid) edge when removed with a can opening
tool.  A can opening tool can be very small, e.g., the military-style
can openers, which by itself is not dangerous.  Again, any piece of cloth forms a graspable handle on the resulting sharp-edged disc.
3. Even a beverage can, e.g., from a beer purchased in flight, can be
ripped into a sharp edge, although the thinness of the (typically soft
aluminum) metal makes this less effective than the above.
4. The large knitting (crochet) needles which I believe
the TSA admits could be filed into a sharp point, producing
a spike as effective as some you list.  As these are typically
aluminum, abrading them into a point would not be difficult.
5. It is possible that a skilled knife maker could chip a glass
bottle into a knife while in the restroom, producing something
comparable to the obsidian knife you list.  The production process
might be noisy however, unlike the above.
Comment, which you will no doubt ignore:
Given the facility with which weapons are improvised or concealed,
it might be a better idea to stop motivating the
actors, as distasteful as that might be to some in power.
Although some will enjoy the Israel-like police
state that foreign entanglement will otherwise drag the US
into, and some -perhaps your- careers might even advance faster
under such conditions.
Have a nice day
A. Citizen

@_subject: New info on Palladium 
For some updated news about NGSCB, aka Palladium, go to the Microsoft
NGSCB newsgroup page at
This might be a good forum for cypherpunks to ask questions about
There was a particularly informative posting by Ellen Cram of Microsoft on
October 15.  Among other things she reveals that the Longhorn pre-release
to be distributed at the Microsoft PDC (conference) will include NGSCB
technology.  It's not clear how this will work without the specialized
hardware features, though.
Also getting attention is a bizarre attempt at guerrilla marketing,
where Microsoft employees are running blogs to promote Longhorn.
 provides a good example.  In "How
to Hate Microsoft", Robert Scoble, Longhorn technology evangelist,
wants you to tell him everything you don't like about Longhorn.  Pull no
punches, he begs.  So far there are a few comments about DRM but not
much specifically about Palladium/NGSCB.
On another front, John Walker of AutoCAD fame, who supported
a number of quixotic projects through the 80s and 90s, like the
ill-fated Xanadu, has a new publication out.  The Digital Imprimatur,
 presents a
dystopian future for the Internet that is heavily based on the potential
negative consequences of Trusted Computing technologies like Palladium.
In Walker's view, Palladium will spawn a net where you need a certificate
to participate, and this will naturally lead to a "fully trusted"
network where not only people, but all their transactions and documents
will be certified, hence traceable and accountable.  An "imprimatur"
is a government license to run a printing press, and we will experience
the same effect in the Trusted Internet of the future.
Although Walker's story is meant to be a cautionary tale, the list of
properties of the Trusted Net is so attractive that many readers are
questioning why we should oppose these developments: an end to copyright
violation, (unauthorized) eavesdropping, scams, security fraud, SPAM,
worms and viruses.  Walker's architecture also supports search engines
that are 100% accurate, with low maintenance.  The Trusted Net limits
child pornography (and children's access to adult porn), hate speech,
employee internet abuse, and tax evasion.  It inherently supports DRM,
satisfying the concerns of content providers and providing a foundation
for wide-scale distribution of copyrighted content.
Walker has put an intentionally favorable slant on his presentation in
order to demonstrate how plausible it is that people will accept the
restrictions of Palladium in exchange for all these benefits.  The spam
menace is already leading to calls for an Internet Drivers License even
from some circles within the pro-freedom crowd, and a Trusted Net would
be only a small additional step.
While Walker's description of "how to put the Internet genie back in
the bottle" is sobering, his track record as a prognosticator is not
promising.  He was wrong about the net before, and he's probably wrong
about it now.  A rather dull discussion forum for the essay is running
at

Yes, unfortunately most of the literature of this type
fails to recognize the basic problem in the US -- that what
really is needed to ensure freedom for the rest of us is
to round up all the christians and put them some place where
they can no longer bother anyone. Preferably a gas chamber.
