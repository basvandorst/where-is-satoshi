============================== START ==============================
What is the procedure for restoring a person's e-mail what has happened
was the user set the date of his computer to year 2000 for testing, but
since there was a 60 day purge of all e-mail the user lost all of his
e-mail, what files do I need to restore, to get the users e-mail back
from tape.
