So you're saying, for instance, that the *proper* thing to do if you disagree
with the anti-circumvention rules that the DMCA added to 17 USC 1201 is to just
go ahead and break them, or that the proper thing to do is to lobby to get
the law fixed?
I'd suggest that the right thing to do is to lobby your congresscreatures,
unless you're a visiting Russian programmer who wants to be a test case....
Yes, sometimes breaking the law in order to force a test case so there's
a judicial review of the constitutionality is required.  But unless you're
trying to be either a test case or a martyr, you're stuck with the law until
it's changed.

If it's a Flash exploit, and the miscreants only do a Windows version because
that gets them 85% of the targets and they feel the effort of creating a Mac/
Linux version isn't worth the incremental 15%,  then you'll only see hits from
Windows boxes. But how does that make it a Microsoft problem?
You don't see spam from many Linux boxes because there aren't enough Linux
boxes to make it cost-effective to develop malware for.  If you need 5,000
bots, it's easier to find 5,000 Windows targets than finding 5,000 Linux
targets.  And the reason you don't see worms that target Z/OS or VMS or Irix
isn't because of their inherent security. The only way you'll get it to be a
non-Microsoft problem is by changing the playing field enough so that OSX and
Linux and others have enough market share that targeting just Windows is a
losing strategy.  Good luck with that.
Meanwhile, ponder what I mentioned in a previous mail - Windows is *already*
close to "as secure as you can sell to an end user".  Consider these Google
results for SELinux:
SELinux howto - about 96,900 results
SELInux disable - about 178,000 results
SELinux turn off - about 199,000 results
It's pretty obvious that there is a point where most users won't put up with
the inconvenience of security, and SELinux is already on the far side of it,
even for the probably-more-technical users of Linux. How are you going to sell
similar hardening to Joe Sixpack, given that most of the hardening will result
in either additional "are you sure?" pop-ups or breakage of things they bought
the computer to do?  The first time a user gets fragged in WoW or other game
because the security threw up a pop-up at an inopportune time, that user *will*
look for a way to turn the security off.

Unfortunately, this is one you really don't want to do.  Microsoft's current
offerings are about as hardened as the competition (Apple and Linux, mostly)
right out of the box.  And it's not clear that you can *make* a system much
harder and still sell it to consumers (try using a Linux box with SELinux
turned on in full MLS/MCS mode - quite secure, but *not* the easiest thing in
the world to admin, especially if you ever add a third-party program that
doesn't have a suitable MLS security policy description already).
And if you win the lawsuit, what does that get you?  Microsoft goes broke,
quits shipping security updates to everybody - and things are even worse
than before, because now *everybody* is unpatched.
The second issue is that if you *do* establish a legal precident that
software vendors are liable for faults no matter what the contract/EULA
says, you're going to see pretty much all the open-source projects pack
up and go home unless they find a way to protect themselves.  Quite
likely some commercial software vendors will bail as well, or charge a *lot*
more for their stuff.
Be careful what you ask for, for you may surely get it.

This is also a misleading statement.  Explain the difference between
a consumer ISP selling you a cable Internet plan knowing that NN% of

and a TOR node providing transit knowing that NN% will be similarly

In other words, if TOR exit nodes provide a "knowingly illegal offering",

(Also, feel free to cite actual statute or case law that says TOR is

Absent that, it's not  a "knowingly illegal offering" the same way that

There's a bit more trust (not much, but a bit) to be attached to a

to a self-signed cert you've never seen before.
However, if you trust a CA-signed cert more than you trust a self-signed
cert *that you yourself created*, there's probably a problem there someplace.
(In other words, you should be able to tell Gmail "yes, you should expect
to see a self-signed cert with fingerprint 'foo' - only complain if you
see some *other* fingerprint".  To the best of my knowledge, there's no
currently known attack that allows the forging of a certificate with a
pre-specified fingerprint.  Though I'm sure Steve Bellovin will correct
