My name is Saurabh Shah and I am a second year undergraduate student at
DA-IICT, Gandhinagar, India. I have quite lately been contributing towards
the open source organizations and I find your organization the most
appropriate one to work on.
I request you to please guide me through the installation of your codebase
and how to get started to your organization.
Thanking You,
Saurabh Shah.
