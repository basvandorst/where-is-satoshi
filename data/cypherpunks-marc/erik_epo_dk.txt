I just tried installing skype-1.2.0.17-fc3.i586.rpm on FC4, not the
Italian version though, the English, and the country pull down looked
rather strange. It displayed all the countries it could on one full
screen page with no scroll bars. I think you should file a bug report
with the skype support team.
