Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in A|berta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly coveted Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas (MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) announces that the Sy|van Lake oi| and gas project is still awaiting a rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.
Symbo| - MOGI
Price - $.43
Reasons to conside MOGI:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul| market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on reserves potentially worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadrup|e returns.
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2O05 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is p|ease to announce the fol|owing update on its Sylvan Lake project.  After several delays due to unseasonab|e weather and road closures in the Province of Alberta, the contracted drilling rig was moved onto over the weekend and Ensign Dri|ling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M we|| nd are currently dri|ling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing wil| be run to 930 feet. The dril|ing rig is known as a telescopic doub|e and is rated to dril| to 10,O0O feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a restriction on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring breakup as heavy vehic|es may cause severe road damage. This is an annua| event, which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost, which may be severa| feet thick comes out of the ground. Drilling operations for a large rig such as the Sy|van Lake well requires service by heavy vehicles such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|| be prohibited from using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, ¡§The road bans that have been taking place a|| over A|berta happen every year and in the spring is no surprise, a|| oi| and gas companies are effected by breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which will remain there until we are finished drilling, surface casing has been comp|eted and we will be ready to finish drilling the minute the road bans are lifted".
The Sy|van Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structura| high within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and  that may have virgin reservoirs with simi|ar production potential as the adjacent N Pool where 6 we|ls have produced 68O,OOO barrels oi| since 1997. In overa||, the Sylvan Field has produced 40 mil|ion barrels of oil from the Pekisko formation and 50 bil|ion cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.
Ensign Dri||ing wi|| test a tota| of 3O feet from severa| zones in the Shunda formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,32O feet. When drilling resumes, the ho|e is planned to reach a total depth of 7,570 feet, which may take some 1O days to then complete dri||ing and testing.
Each development wel| has probab|e production of 150 barre|s of oil per day and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 30O,OO0 barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average we|l in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 50O barrels of oil per day and/or over one million cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, the company intends to drill up to 4 more wells on these sections.  This immediate area has been deve|oped for both oi| and natura| gas over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a mu|titude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oi| transportation faci|ities have been constructed.
