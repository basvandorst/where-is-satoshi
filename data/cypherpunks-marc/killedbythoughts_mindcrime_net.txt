Drew, you simply don`t understand the basics.
Did he force you to use the software? Not. Uhh...
The idea of Open Source is that *you* can check, what the software
does for you. If you want trust, dont't rely primarily on others. Set
up an own proxy in *your* country.
This is true indeed. But you had the source, hadn`t you?
Well, guess hwo many governments are interested in my phone calls to
Iraq. Definitly more than two. No. If you use a service located in a foreign country you should
expect, to be treated according to the laws in that country.
Legislation concerning privacy is on quite a low standard in the
united states. If I definitely want privacy, I dont't give my data
over there.
Supposed I buy Windows somewhere in the world and use some network
connection: I don't use neccessarily communication ressources of a
third contry. There is not the faintest reason why the NSA could
reclaim a right to use any trojan features. See the difference?
But since you live in a free country and source code of JAP is
availiable I expect you to run some Proxies. I am *realy* interested
for how long they will be tolerated by the local authorities. Really.
They intercept communication. They leave questionable foot prints in
closed source software. What is your contries contribution for Open
Source? GnuPG? Not really. Anonymous proxies? Not yet.
If you need a high level of secutity, use the source. You can do it
Uh? Who "hacked into [your] system"? Poor adminstration skills? Oh,
This is crap.
Logging functions have been set up in accordance with german
courts. If you have an issue with that, you need to take that up with
the court.
