I might add that as far as I know, this work has not been picked up yet by neither FreeBSD, nor Linux, so if you feel like giving the project a hand pushing it into the mainstream, I'm pretty sure mc would be very happy. I.e. I don't think anything is following on this work unless someone reading this helps making that happen. Personally I have neither the skills nor the contacts needed.
