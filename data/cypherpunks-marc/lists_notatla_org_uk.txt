Tom Ritter If the ISP transparently redirects outbound mail to their own
mailserver then the TLS mail will fail for lacking the right
key.  I saw an example of this in 2005.  Killing the STARTTLS
makes it work in store-and-forward fashion.
I agree that to serve the customer the ISP should do what's been
agreed and not spring surprises.  Perhaps the ISP judged that
for most users working with missing encryption was less surprising
than getting a message they'd need help understanding.
