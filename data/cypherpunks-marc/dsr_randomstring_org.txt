ctrl-alt-F2, login will be on a console terminal running a getty
variant in which everything has been handled by root since init.
As a bonus, X11 will no longer be able to record your
keystrokes since it isn't in the execution path.
Similarly, a getty run by root on a serial port will do.

softlimit is packaged in daemontools.
       softlimit - runs another program with new resource
       softlimit [ opts ] child
       opts is a series of getopt-style options.  child consists
of one or more arguments.
       softlimit sets soft resource limits as specified by opts.
It then runs child.
       In  each  of  the  following  opts, n may be =,
indicating that the soft limit should be set equal to the hard
       limit.
       opts controlling memory use:
       -m n   Same as -d n -s n -l n -a n.
       -d n   Limit the data segment per process to n bytes.
       -s n   Limit the stack segment per process to n bytes.
       -l n   Limit the locked physical pages per process to n
bytes. This option has no  effect  on  some  operating
              systems.
       -a n   Limit  the  total  of  all segments per process to
n bytes. This option has no effect on some operating
              systems.
.... and so on for other resources to limit.
