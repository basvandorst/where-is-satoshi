    To understand the enormity of this development,               you must recall that anthrax is one of the most serious of all terrorist               threats. The US Department of Defense calls anthrax the worst of               all biological weapons, so highly lethal that 100 million lethal               doses can be obtained from a single gram of material. However,               eFoodSafety has perfected what is proving to be the only known substance               to kill 100% of all anthrax that is safe to use, even around humans, animals and food!     In similar technological developments, eFoodSafety has perfected EPA-tested processes designed to improve the sanitization of food and food-handling facilities that could quite literally make decades-old food cleansing practices obsolete within 2 to 5 years.
 EFSF shares could skyrocket on the anthrax news alone…
But with its EPA-tested, 100% effective technology for food safety, already proven effective against the top 6 food-borne pathogens, EFSF shares could become a true wealth-maker in your portfolio!
    Longer term, eFoodSafety management               projects several hundred million in revenues for its revolutionary food-safe sanitization processes, processes that are twice as effective at eradicating the EPA's top 6 pathogens compared to prevailing practices, and is lower cost and easier to use. These developments could make EFSF a $30 stock in 5 years!
    In                   time, eFoodSafety shows significant promise for becoming standardized                   throughout agriculture and food delivery pipeline. It’s                   proving to be 3,200 times more effective than existing processes,                   as well as being less costly and less toxic in use.                       These benefits alone could be enough                     to make EFSF a hugely profitable investment at this stage                     of the game…but there’s one more benefit that                     could revolutionize the industry and make early investors                     rich.
    When the eFoodSafety process is used with               almost any fresh fruit or vegetable, shelf life (time from field               to table) improves anywhere from 48% to 227%!
    Simply by changing to eFoodSafety cleansing               processes, farmers, shippers, and grocers can get more food to consumers               at lower cost.
