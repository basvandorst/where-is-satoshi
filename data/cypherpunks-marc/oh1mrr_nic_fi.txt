skype.i586                          2.1.0.81-fc10                           That I have, and I have no camera, so no need others. But it seems, this version of skype is somehow broken with kde/pulseaudio. If I use only my intel-hda card I can use skype, but in KMIX there's only volume controlls available, nothing else. Earlier version of Skype let me choose which card I use for Skype.
This .81 just gives me pulseaudio, nothing else.
This is desktop computer, so in laptop there can be some other

audio volume
Using Kde, maybe there's the problem. If I install pavu, at first use it crash and skype is unusable and loud another thing is This has to be some kde related, because in Kmix there's just volume controlls both cards, nothing else. But when I force remove pulseaudeio, I get all controlls into Kmix back. And ofcource then I can select in Skype, which card I use.
But the problem is, that this .81 version of skype, mic input is no worky, or better say, if I make testcall and listen it, there's playback like in low motion films. But in .47 version it worked OK.

Intresting prog, have to look it in future. But that's not the problem. I can install skype, but this newest version of it with my hw and pulseaudio makes life unconfortable. I use 32bit version of fc13.
I wish, that in future I could find, when install FC, place where to set
"use pulseaudio yes no to absolutely NO" :D

That's the version, what does not work for me... It didn't work in fc12 either. I have two cards, intel-hda and ens-1370 and with pulseaudio it is impossiple to set? skype to use one and then use another card just for listening music. This pulse***** has made my audio use quite limited...
So 2.1.47 worked fine with two cards...

Anyone can point me, where to get fedora package of skype-2.1.47 That's the last one, which worked with my cards. I have lost mine, and I installed new beta, no worky. I can hear all ok, but using mic is no way.
So any help?
