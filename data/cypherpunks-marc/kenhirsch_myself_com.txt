In general you have to consider the whole system, including derivation
rules, not just the axioms, although you can certain start with a set of
axioms like:
{ x=1,  x=2}
or, come to think of it,
{ 1=2 }
Most famously, Frege's system was shown to be inconsistent by Russel.  More
recently, the first edition of Quine's Mathematical Logic (1940) was shown
to be inconsistent by Rosser.
For Frege, see "From Frege to Gvdel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic,
1879-1931" by Jean van Heijenoort

There was an interesting article in the New York Times (
back in Nov 2001 about stenographers working on 9/11--that was an angle I didn't see
anywhere else.  When these special reports come on--and then go on and on and
on--the captioners don't get a break.   There are no commercials and they have to
keep typing even though the talking heads get to take turns.  On 9/11 it was even
worse because communications in NY were so screwed up.
Y'all are making a big deal about the "dangerous debris".  As you may have noticed,
there were very few real facts to report so they kept repeating the few tidbits they
had, whether they made sense or not.  The danger may well be overblown, but it is
just prudent of NASA to say not to touch it. There were some pretty big pieces that
fell and it is plausible they are still dangerous:
Good article from 1980 on the boondoggle that is the space shuttle:

I don't think there are any difficult legal issues involved.  If you drop your
wallet on someone's property, it is still your wallet.  If you crash your car onto
somebody's front yard, it's still your car (for better or worse).  If a plane
crashes carrying U.S. mail, the Post Office gathers up whatever mail it can find and
tries to deliver it.  Would you have it any other way?
Even if ownership was in question, does anybody really think it's a good idea to
sell the pieces of evidence while the accident investigation is going on?

There's not a special exemption for reporters.  It is only a crime to reveal the
identity of covert agent if you learn of it because of authorized access to
classified information or your are engaged in "a pattern of activities intended to
identify and expose covert agents and with reason to believe that such activities
would impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States".
