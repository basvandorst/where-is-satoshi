Jim Choate  pointed out:
which there is a link to a secure (SSL) web page. From there, if you've never used ZixMail before, you set up a key for yourself by adding your e-mail address and a password to the database. (Any e-mail address will do, but be aware that your "key" will be linked to that particular e-mail address from now on  you can't use another e-mail address for sending or receiving ZixMail without going through this setup again.)
(Get this:)
ZixIt quietly generates a key for you and stores it on their server for future (Both halves? Zap. End program.)
Now you can go read and respond to the encrypted e-mail from your friend or colleague at the ZixMail web site. That e-mail can be responded to, back and forth, for an unlimited period of time  you cannot, however, generate a new piece of e-mail (unrelated, to another person) unless you download the software and run it yourself.
