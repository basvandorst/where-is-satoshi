A quick check of the site shows one mirror in Canada, the rest in
Europe. An Asian, Australian or Latin American mirror might be a good
idea. Volunteers?

Beyond doubt it is important to keep FreeS/WAN free, specifically to
continue development in ways that keep it clear of US regulations. I
think that means not taking US contributions to the code. Various Americans have made important contributions by testing, reporting
bugs, joining design discussions and so on, just not code.
To me, the interesting question is what can we do to get FreeS/WAN
more widely distributed, without giving up that freedom.
FreeS/WAN is already included in several Linux distributions not produced
in the US. SuSE, Mandrake, Conectiva, ...
For a list, see:
However, RedHat does not include it. The issue doesn't seem to be just that
they don't ship crypto. Checking the RPMs on RedHat 7.2, I find GnuPG, OpenSSH, OpenSSL, CIPE, ... but not FreeS/WAN.
So should we just suggest that everyone buy distributions that do include
Or is there something we should be doing to get RedHat, and Debian, and
other US-based distributions to include it?

Worth discussing at least.
Why would you use racoon? FreeS/WAN's Pluto is available, under GPL,
already does OE, and works with 2.6 kernel IPsec (though I'm not
certain if patches are needed for that). Wouldn't it be a better
starting point?
