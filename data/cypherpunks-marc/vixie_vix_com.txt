Nothing to see.  Move along.
I think of civil disobedience as "some respect for the laws" since folks like
Randy whose conscience would not permit them to obey certain laws knew that
they would likely go to jail and did what they did anyway.
Redefining what an ISP is, in order to evade the FBI's intent, lacks respect.

Warning: dangerously irrelevant and completely off-topic for the NANOG list.
You've got me all wrong.  I support the police in my state (country).
Right.  When my kids and I line up for exercises at the local school most
mornings, you'll find me, hat in one hand and the other over my heart,
facing the flag, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and meaning every word
of it except maybe the part about God which I consider to be ambiguous.
And when paying taxes I am particularly glad that the cost of my family's
security comes at merely a cost measurable as a fraction of my income.
YMMV of course.  If you don't like the deal you're being offered you should
find a better one.
Somewhere along with the power to vote particular politicians in or out
must come some respect for the laws those people create, even the ones we
don't think are perfect.
The FBI has a hellish job on their hands right now.  Actually it's been a
hellish job for a long time but it seems like only recently we're all aware
of how hellish it is.  I don't think that redefining what an ISP is in order
to blunt the obvious intent of Omnivore (or whatever) is a useful exercise
of democratic power.

Not picking on anyone in particular but just plucking an example at ~random:
It's possible that the feds are going about this in the wrong way.  Rather
than seeking ways to expose that wrongness if any, we ought to be putting
our effort into figuring out what they're trying to do and then making a
recommendation (or several) as to how to actually get it done.
Put your shoulder to this wheel, folks.  Or find someplace else to live.
(There's a four year sunset provision in the law they're passing tonight.)
