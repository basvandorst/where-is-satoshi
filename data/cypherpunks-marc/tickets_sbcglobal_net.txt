Dear sir or madam,
I was browsing through the results from a search engine when I came across your site.  It has a lot of good, relevant information and I was hoping that we could exchange links.  Doing so would not only help our regular visitors find other useful pages, but it would also make our sites rank higher in search engines like Google, AOL, MSN, and Yahoo.  Exchanging links would be free and beneficial for both of our sites.
My web page is over 4 years old and receives more than 2,000 visitors a day.  I try to offer the best information available on any topic I think my visitors would appreciate, but concentrate mostly on NFL enthusiast related information and services.  The site has sections for every NFL team, including the Atlanta Falcons.
If youd like to exchange links for our mutual benefit, please respond to this email.  Id be happy to discuss it with you.
