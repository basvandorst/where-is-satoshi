Yet you trust companies in this country who will engage in warrantless
wiretapping for a fee?

We aren't talking about the net a source of amusement. It is an
essential means for news, information, communication and political
speech. Consider what some people use Tor for. As it is, access in the
US is controlled by a few powerful telecoms, and if one of them
arbitrarily decides to preclude Tor or other anonymity programs, it will
have wide effects.
I would not use Comcast, wouldn't trust them given their history (e.g.,
BitTorrent). They're under-handed, lying and basically corrupt. To the
OP, consider changing services.
