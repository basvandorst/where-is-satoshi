A. Kong:
TorBirdy works fine with Gmail and there should be no issues, except in
rare cases where certain exit nodes cause Gmail to lock an account (and
therefore POP/IMAP access) until the user logs in through the web
interface and enters a CAPTCHA.
Please let us know the issue/ error message.

Please open a ticket describing your issue with the error message(s)
[0], so that we can diagnose this better. I think this seems like a
configuration issue, otherwise many users are using Gmail with TorBirdy
quite nicely!

Akagi Kong:
Yes we are aware of this issue. But once your account is locked, you
_have to_ log in via the web interface (and possibly change your
password) to fix this, so even if we do start a new circuit, it won't
help much.
Suggestions on how to fix this are welcome.
Which version of TorBirdy are you using?
We fixed this proxy issue in the latest release (0.0.13) [0], so try
using that.
