Given "These attacks have, and future attacks would, threaten the stability of the EveryDNS.net infrastructure, which enables access to almost 500,000 other websites." I'd say they had DOS issues with their nameservers. They can't be expected to let their other domains go down in efforts to protect a single domain.
I'm guessing they weathered the problem somewhat, as they actually gave 24h notice. However, excessive loads and constant monitoring and protective measures on a free service would definitely be something a company would want to stop.

*cough* 10G burstable with 1-2G commit. Still cheaper than anything else
I have or can get, and more likely to handle those large DDOS cases,
where you can just reroute the effected network through the 10G and
mitigate with whatever hardware you have.
True, but they often will dedicate some time and effort during an attack to make things work. There are many in-house custom solutions you can use, and we've seen public blacklists use many of them over the years. If you want the extra support during the crisis, you pay the 3rd party for their product to get it.

That may well be true. I'm an eyeball network and I can usually point at a user pissing someone off on IRC/Forums for DOS instigating. I probably deal with 1 large scale attack per year at most, though most likely my attacks are from smaller botnet owners.

I think the difference here is scale. packet-flooding attacks often do
fill links; if the links drop to 155mb/s or below. I've seen some gig+ DOS, but that is less common. The DOS I posted a flow capture link for wasn't that large, but enough to flood out the little DS3 going to the small town where the target DSL customers was.

You mean silly things like:
Warning, it is an 87160 line flow capture.

For IPs that don't matter, automated /32 blackholes are usually supported by most providers. For critical infrastructure, I've not had a problem with the security/abuse/noc departments working with me to resolve the issue.
The first step to DOS mitigation is being able to shut down the attack vector. If they hit an IP, shut it down, let the 50 other distributed systems take care of it.
It's all a matter of perspective, and it has to be handled on a case by case basis. I had a dialup modem bank IP get DOS's due to a customer off it. Well, the modem bank itself doesn't need to talk to the outside world (outside of traceroutes), so a quick blackhole of it stopped the DDOS (which was a small 300mb/s).
I've talked with several providers who will gladly redirect a subset of IP's through their high end filters, so in event of DOS, I can drop that servers, and get clean traffic back to my network.

I call BS. Windows has it's problems, but it is the most common exploited as it holds the largest market share. Many Windows infections I've seen occur not due to the OS, but due to lack of patching of applications on the OS. The system does as much as it can.
I've seen plenty of webmail/php/cgi hacks to not blame M$ for having market share.

Yeah, that's the problem. The Internet isn't the Internet. The data needs of public Internet have reached a level that it is actually cheaper to consider the networks we use to transport that data as our primary networks, and run everything else over it as bonus recovery revenue (and MPLS became really popular).
Most LECs are at least considering, if they haven't implemented, SIP/MGCP from DLC/ONT to local or region soft switches. In addition, long distance is increasingly running over pseudowire or SIP trunks.
Cell networks are definitely pushing hard to drop the old T1 circuits and cranking up 300mb+ circuits, which often causes the carriers of those circuits to backhaul the other cell companies who still require T1 via pseudowire. They aren't being picky either. I about died laughing watching a small LEC setup some feeds for some cell towers. The circuits cross 4 different networks with at least 3 different types of transport configurations (gpon through a calix E7, which is pure L2 ethernet, Lucent DMX ethernet over sonet, and a high end Alacatel IP/MPLS network which I'm sure carries Internet traffic as well).

Eh, We'd all rub our eyes, see the light creeping under the door, and actually go and see what's going on outside. :)
Except the HAM operators. They don't need the Internet to stay inside.

The A-team doesn't get caught and detailed. The purpose of the other teams is to detect easy targets, handle easy jobs, and create lots of noise for the A-team to hide in. Hacking has always had a lot in common with magic. Misdirection is a useful tool.
