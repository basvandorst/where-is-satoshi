Are you talking about Craig Wright's "private demonstrations" to Gavin
Andresen etc?

Tbf there are no (spendable) accounts which are known to be Satoshi for
There's the genesis block reward (not spendable due to a quirk in the
protocol), the address Satoshi used to send the first transaction to Hal
Finney (was this really Satoshi? We don't know for sure) and there are a
bunch of blocks that we strongly suspect were mined by Satoshi due to their
characteristics (mainly the incrementing nonce value).
Something signed with the genesis block reward address's private key would
be best proof... But still not perfect, since we don't really even know if
Satoshi was the same person over time, or if the same person operated all
the Satoshi email/forum accounts.
I don't believe this new pretender really is Satoshi  though (or,
hypothetically, any of the people who spoke as "Satoshi") because the
writing style is way off. Satoshi was never a mystic. Satoshi never spoke
in grand narratives either, just engineering pragmatism.

Satoshi actually never, ever signed anything cryptographically.
We don't even know for sure if whitepaper Satoshi, genesis block Satoshi,
email address(es, there were two) Satoshi, and BitcoinTalk Satoshi were the
same person.

I managed the extract that file successfully.
I uploaded the extract to GitHub if you wanna just git clone it instead:

Hi, send me a password in the same way. I'll get the FTP set up (though it
will likely be monday before I can).
Once I've done that, I'll post the details to the list, absent the password
you chose.

This is fantastic. Thank you very much. I was expecting to have to gather
this stuff piecemeal.

I've written a blog post about this with further details if anyone is
The primary reason I'm sending this email is to appeal to those of you who
have been active on the list since before July 2013 (when the switch to GNU
Mailman occurred) and to those of you who know now-inactive subscribers who
may also have this information.
There is a total black hole in terms of available archived threads from
early 1999 to mid 2013. I've contacted the guy who ran the al-qaeda.net
node and dug around in the way back machine trying to locate these
archives. No luck so far.
I'm worried this information will be lost permanently if a concerted effort
isn't made to preserve it now, while *some* of it is perhaps still
preserved on people's hard drives. I have no doubt that some (maybe most)
of the threads from the early 2000s may already be lost permanently.
Please get in touch if you think you can help out at all.

Sorry, I only just saw this, messages addressed to me get filtered to a
label if they're also addressed to the mailing list. I should see if I can
change my filter to make an exception for this in my filter rule.
I've replied properly in another thread.

The count was performed by me programmatically. That count represents all
the emails associated with that email address that are present in the
venona raw archives.

Cheers for the response.
If any of you find anything new, if you emailed me directly, I'd be really
grateful (i.e. not to the list in case I miss it due to my filter).

can i confirm that this is the Venona archive merged with the 2000-2016
archive from this post:
i.e. that we don't have a new, overlapping archive of the 90s period? I'm
assuming venona is still the only game in town for the 90s period.

I'm just a guy with a website. Believe me, it saddens me that so much is
lost, that's why I originally started trying to piece it all together, but
my leads ran cold, and if you go look at the commit logs for crypto
anarchy.wiki you'll see how little time I've had to work on it lately.
In terms of whether this is deliberate forgery or just lost data, I have no
way of finding out because I don't have other copies of the archive to
compare with. That's the only way to do it. And even then I can only detect
tampering, not innocent loss of data. I was under ten years old during this
period so I'm flying blind in terms of what it should look like.
I'm not a player in this drama, I'm just a guy who is mirroring what's
available so that isn't lost too.
I simply don't have the time to help you at the moment. I have too many
other commitments. I haven't even found time to merge the 1999-onwards
If you find a lead on any of it, let me know. As far as I can tell, Ryan
Lackey is the only one who can help you. This archive originates on Venona.
That I'm pretty sure about. If he won't respond to you, I don't know what
can be done. I really hope someone else finds an archive of this era,
because it's the most important era for sure.
But other than that, please bear in mind that I'm on your side. We both
have the same goal: a complete, accurate archive. I've done what I can so
far. I won't have time to work on this actively in the near future.

It's not that I don't care, I just don't know what I can do about it. This
appears to be the only copy of the archive available.
If anyone else has a more complete archive, send it to me and I'll merge
