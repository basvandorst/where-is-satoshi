Same here :)
To the extent that I understand, coderman seems to be proposing the
layer-3 approach from Kiraly et al. (2008) with multi-homed endpoints
and various traffic control mechanisms. That does seem interesting.
Perhaps someone could comment about Tor's current development plans
(or point me to documents)? Maybe I should just look ;)
This is the issue that's been nagging me. The utility of Tor (or
coderman's vision, or even VPNs) is limited when access can be
detected and blocked. Could something like Tor operate through
covert channels (1,2)? Although only ~0.1% of total bandwidth would be
usable, that might be enough with widespread streaming HD video.
