It was time...  What are we going to do tonight? I asked.  Hi, I said to all the animals.  Suddenly, he disappeared.
He wanted to know more.  I'm evil.  I'm evil.  I'll tell you what happened next.   I can never describe the walk back to my truck.  (I'd seen something really weird. :)  He extended his hand by way of introduction.  But under the circumstances, I'd do it again.I didn't have to say: can we change the meeting from 6 to 11?  My kids have a music recital and I dont want to miss it for the world.  It was cold and sweet.  What is the answer?  There were many examples of animals all around. Sounds good to me, I said.
