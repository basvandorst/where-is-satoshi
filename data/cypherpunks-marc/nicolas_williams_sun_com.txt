Note that this is not all that bad because many apps can do
authentication at the application layer, and if you add channel binding
then you can leave session crypto to IPsec while avoiding MITMs (they
get flushed by channel binding).
This is the premise of BTNS + connection latching.  W/o channel binding
it's better than nothing, though not much.  W/ channel binding it should
be much easier to deploy (beyond software updates) than plain IPsec with
similar security guarantees.

Indeed.  But it's as quiet as the old list :/
Seriously, the work of the BTNS WG is, IMO, crucial to the use of IPsec
as an end-to-end solution (as opposed to as a VPN solution, for which
IPsec is already pretty darned good).  If you care, then please
participate, or even better, implement.
That anyone is working on IPETEE indicates that end-to-end IPsec
solutions are desired.  The in-band nature of the IPETEE key exchange
indicates, to me, a dislike of IKE, or perhaps unawareness of BTNS WG
(man, the WG's name doesn't reflect very well what it does), or perhaps
a misunderstanding of IPsec.

I did miss it.  Thanks for the link.  I don't think in-band key exchange
is desirable here, but, you never know what will triumph in the
Connection latching, which is the BTNS WG equivalent of 'IPETEE', but
much simpler, is in the IESG's hands now.

How do identities help?  It's supposed to be anonymous cash, right?  And
say you identify a double spender after the fact, then what?  Perhaps
you're looking at a disposable ID.  Or perhaps you can't chase them
Double spend detection needs to be real-time or near real-time.
