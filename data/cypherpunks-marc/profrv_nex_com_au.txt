famous line,
          "Shoot them down like partridges."
...it shocked the intelligent & honest minds of Europe
& America into a critical examination of Bolshevik theories &
practices. It exploded the Bolshevik myth of the Communist
State being the "Workers' & Peasants' Government."
        Alexander Berkman, The Kronstadt Rebellion (Berlin:
            Der Syndikalist, 1922), pp. 41-42.
      Poet Kenneth Rexroth (From the Paris
      Commune to the Kronstadt Rebellion), was one
      of those few Americans who, for example, saw
      through Bolshevik pretenses as early as 1921,
      when Trotsky & Lenin crushed the libertarian
      revolt of the Kronstadt soviet.
     While clearly opposing all forms of
     Communism he did not, like so many others of
     his generation, react into supporting Western
     capitalism or becoming a "Cold War Warrior".
     The Kronstadt Revolt was a topic at meetings
     he helped organize with the San Francisco
     Anarchist Circle in the 1940s.
                     I am far better aware of

                     Warmonger. But it wont get you
                     Anywhere to tell me I should
                     Welcome the beast who devours me
                     Just because a bigger lion
                     Is eating somebody else on
                     The other side of the arena.
1937 -- England: 1,000 rally against war, Hyde Park, London.
1937 -- England: With novelist Ethel Mannin, Emma Goldman
speaks  in Bristol on the Revolution in Spain.
1939 -- John Fahey (1939-2001), eccentric folk guitarist
heralded as a unique alchemist of American roots music & a
powerful influence on his peers, lives.
          I was about thirteen & I saw
          some other guys, older than me,
          they were meeting girls in the
          park in the summer by taking
          guitars out & playing them... I
          didnt meet any girls that way
          until about 10 years later. On the
          other hand I did learn how to
          play the guitar.
In 1957, he heard a Blind Willie Johnson song that
mesmerized him & he began combing the south for
old blues recordings that would shape his musical
mindset. His own foray into recording would
become an instant rarity -- famously, only 95 copies
were made of his first album, "Blind Joe Death," in
1941 -- Happy birthday Alice Brock. Who is Alice Brock?
You know the song "Alice's
Restaurant" by Arlo Guthrie? Oh, that Alice!

                                  1958 -- England: Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
(CND) founded in London.
1959 -- The playwright most known for his verse tragedy,
Maxwell Anderson dies in  Stamford, Connecticut. His
tragedy Winterset (1935), a poetic drama inspired by the
Sacco & Vanzetti anarchist case is his most famous, but
Anderson also wrote musicals, such as Knickerbocker
Holiday (1938) & Lost in the Stars (1949).
1970 -- Jefferson Airplane is fined $1,000 for singing
the "F word" in an Oklahoma City concert.

Somewhere in this SIT classic is a documented description of the body of the king (circa Louis 16) Its quite detailed,the kings person is sacred,no one is to disturb the royal presence and so on.At the end Raoul declares that France now has X million Louis 16's!
In other words our personal space is worthy of respect,equal respect as the highest in the land.This is why I have a slight problem with the idea of a caste of 'protected persons'.Giving one class of people special powers and/or privilege
in a  democracy is dangerous.I would argue that it sets undemocratic forces in motion.In the context of the amerikkkan empire it looks a lot like decadence.Decadence in the sense of putrefaction and corruption.
What happened to one unfortunate who approached to close to the king is described in the Tome,"Europe"
What is happening to an unfortunate individual in alleged possession of the "burning bush" note seems the modern equivalent.
This is why I sign as 'killthepresident' sometimes.I exercise my civil and human right to free speech and my profound disapproval of a grossly undemocratic decadent SITuation.Death to all elites and alpha males.

Interviews with a shrink are rare when your on the disability support,I had one about every 20 years...till recently.
I had one a couple of weeks ago where my Dr agreed to write to the Victorian police about a notebook computer seized by them.I had explained to my Dr that the police taking eight months to even interview me,(still not charge me)was stressful and he seemed to agree.
Today my case worker called by to tell me another interview had been arranged for tomorrow.(fri.)As this is extremely unusual I inquired as to the reason.He informs me that a Federal policeman,one David Hall had been in touch with them in regard to alleged internet E-journalism by me.
David Hall and another fed along with an "observer" and a US SS agent,rick Walkinshaw accompanied the 5 Victorian plod that raided me last june and stole my notepad.

It was meant to build confidence, but 30 managers of the KFC fast food restaurant were left nursing sore feet after a firewalk did not go as planned.
Twenty people were taken to Hunter Valley hospitals, seven with deep burns to their feet and 13 with less serious injuries, after the bonding exercise went wrong. Ten others were treated by the 11 ambulance crews called to scene just after 2pm.
Among those taken to hospital was KFC's Australian chief, Roger Eaton..
The accident took place on the last day of a motivational conference for 180 NSW KFC bosses at the Horizons golf resort at Salamander Bay, Port The firewalking exercise, which is undertaken by many companies, was one of the last of the program, and was supposed to build confidence in the managers. It was voluntary.
Angus Armstrong, a legal spokesman for Tricon Restaurant Australia, which runs the KFC franchise in Australia, said last night that the firm regarded the safety of its staff above all, and was at a loss to explain what went Both Tricon and WorkCover have begun investigations into the incident.
Mr Armstrong said an independent company conducted the firewalking exercise and KFC had used it twice before without incident.
He said the seven people taken to John Hunter Hospital, among them Mr Eaton, were initially feared to have serious burns, but their burns had been found not to be so severe.
"We have been told that they will be released overnight. We are very pleased to hear that they are not as severe," he said.
Mr Armstrong said it was "totally unacceptable" that anyone should get hurt, adding that Tricon Restaurants "will be reviewing the types of exercises" it conducts at future conferences.
Horizons' marketing manager, Lisa Taylor, declined yesterday to name the company which organised the fire-walking activity.
She said the resort hosted various corporate groups for motivational seminars but Horizon had nothing to do with the programs.
"[It was] a private company taking part in a motivational team-building exercise run by a professional third party," she said.FROM

The future of computer security
"Invisible Means Invulnerable" Introducing PHANTOM TOTAL SECURITY:
A Breakthrough Computer Security Technology Bound To Become A Standard
Gianus Technologies, Inc., a New York company, has officially unveiled
Phantom Total Security (PTS), a breakthrough computer security software
expected to greatly impact the way computer security is implemented by
both corporate and private users. Phantom TS makes ultimate data protection
affordable and available to all.
Its concept is simple, its power is great: "invisible means invulnerable."
Phantom Total Security (PTS) is a state-of-the-art NON-ENCRYPTION computer
security software capable of protecting ANY type of computer data by making
it completely invisible to hackers, unauthorized users and even viruses.
Phantom TS splits a computer hard disk into two parts, then makes
one part disappear with the simple click of an icon. Everything
contained in the disappearing portion vanishes with it.
Stealth technology for PCs: invisible means invulnerable.
Any type of data on a PC can be protected through invisibility.
Protection extends to any type of information, documents, files, e-mail,
e-commerce, Internet records, audio, video, pictures and software.
PTS offers unprecedented versatility and scope.
The invisible fraction of the disk cannot be attacked by
unauthorized users, hackers, or viruses.
Hackers or unauthorized users cannot steal what they cannot see.
Viruses such as Melissa, ILoveYou or SirCam, cannot destroy
or send out files they cannot detect.
No other security software on the market can make an entire operating
system invisible. Other security software base protection on barriers
such as firewalls, passwords, or encryption - the data itself is always
visible and thus subject to attack. Typically, encryption only protects
one type of data (i.e. text but not video); and corporate firewalls are
ALWAYS vulnerable to insiders, usually responsible for most of the
computer related damage to corporations.
"Single-click" ease of use makes Phantom TS the ideal solution for all
private and business computer users who are familiar with PCs, but
find existing security tools such as firewalls or encryption too difficult
to use. Documents are easily transferred between the "public" and the
"invisible" zone by clicking and dragging from one area of the disk
to the other.
Phantom TS makes ultimate security and privacy available to the
millions of private computer users that currently find other security
systems to be either too difficult to use, or expensive.
PTS allows corporations to protect individual PCs or laptops on their
networks that, even if protected by firewalls, can always be accessed
by unauthorized "insiders" or disgruntled employees often responsible
for substantial damage to large firms.
Lost or stolen corporate laptops will no longer jeopardize the
information they contain.
Currently, Peer-To-Peer (P2P) applications are particularly vulnerable
as remote users are automatically allowed access through firewalls
into corporate networks or private PCs where confidential areas
could be easily accessed.
Phantom TS is ideal for users of Peer-To-Peer technology such as music
sharing programs (i.e. Napster), shared workspaces and instant messaging
software. PTS allows safe file sharing as people connecting
to a user's PC would only see the part of the drive containing
non-confidential files.
Phantom TS requires minimum memory usage, runs Windows 9x/NT/Me/XP,
Unix, Linux.
Phantom TS is currently available pre-installed on Hard-Disks of choice
through selected system integrators and VARs. Furthermore, high level
negotiation are under way with several PC manufacturers for large-scale
deployment as an add-on option on their laptops and PCs.
Pricing to the end user starts at US$ 190, eliminating the gap between
expensive security tools only available to corporations and low-level
security solutions normally used by individuals.

Ben-Menashe always at arms length
By Natalie O'Brien, David Nason and Eric Ellis
February 27, 2002
IN the shadowy world of international arms dealing, there is no more mysterious figure than former Mossad spy Ari Ben-Menashe.
   Advertisement
The spy turned arms dealer and now self-confessed double agent has achieved notoriety for his reported involvement in global scandals from the mysterious death of press baron Robert Maxwell, to the curious case of Mordecai Vanunu, the Israeli now serving life for leaking details of Israel's nuclear program, and, most recently, his role in exposing an alleged plot to assassinate Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.
During the past 15 years, there's barely been an arms scandal in which Ben-Menashe hasn't featured. He was even on the fringes of controversy surrounding the death of Princess Di in 1997.
The 50-something Iranian-born man, who has in some quarters been labelled a liar and a fraud, also reportedly had a meeting with John Howard, when he was Liberal leader in the early 1990s, to discuss claims that Australia was involved in the Iran-Contra deal with shipments passing through the West Australian port of Fremantle.
Ben-Menashe alleged that the Labor Party under Bob Hawke had received $8.5 million as a reward for allowing arms shipments to pass through Australia on the way to Iran.
He told WA Inc Royal Commission investigators about his allegations and the Australian Federal Police were asked to investigate.
However, they took no action because of a lack of evidence.
Ben-Menashe wrote a book, much of it penned in Sydney where he lived in a luxurious Darling Point apartment, while unsuccessfully seeking political The book Profits of War is a thrilling read for conspiracy theorists. Ben-Menashe called it his insurance policy against Mossad assassins who were after him.
Ben-Menashe claims he was a senior Mossad operative. Mossad says he was a lowly-ranked systems analyst. The book detailed many fantastic revelations, most notably that George Bush Sr was the point man who helped orchestrate, via Israel, the so-called October Surprise.
This was the deal made with Iran to delay the release of the 54 Americans held hostage at their embassy in Tehran to coincide with Ronald Reagan's 1981 inauguration.
Conspiracy theorists have described it as a covert coup that toppled the Carter presidency and there has subsequently been plausible evidence that links Republicans to some sort of plot. But the revelation that Bush Sr was involved is Ben-Menashe's alone. The father of the current US President called the charges "bare-faced lies".
And 10 years later, through two Democratic terms and despite many phone calls to their own deep-throat contacts, no one has been able to substantiate Ben-Menashe's claims.
Iran and Robert Maxwell are two of Ben-Menashe's abiding passions. He once claimed Maxwell intended to use profits made from arms sales to Iran to buy Melbourne's The Age newspaper during the struggling Warwick Fairfax era.
It's true that Maxwell was pursuing The Age, but it is more likely he wanted to fund it with the pensions he stole from employees of his Mirror newspaper in Britain, as was revealed after his death.
Ben-Menashe himself faced charges in the US in 1990 for selling military equipment to Iran. Naturally, he claimed the charges were brought by Washington to discredit him.
But he seems to be quite adept at doing that himself. Dickens and Madson, the Montreal political-risk company he runs with an American, Alexander Legault, have admitted to being paid to lobby on behalf of Robert Mugabe's The firm of Dickens and Madson is well-known in African political circles but exactly which countries they have worked for, when and exactly what capacity remains, typically, a riddle that Ben-Menashe is unwilling to solve.

@_subject: South Korea."...use of police against illegal strikes" 
South Korea labor unrest spreads
Tens of thousands of auto and heavy industry workers joined a strike by others in the rail and power industry, spreading labor unrest intended to halt South Korea's privatization program.
Ignoring government warnings, workers at South Korea' s biggest car company, Hyundai Motor Co., and other firms, downed tools in support of a state sector union campaign against the government sell-off.
The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) said 130,000 members took part in protest rallies in 22 cities across the country as part of a four-hour stoppage.
The Korea Employers Federation said 50,000 KCTU members took part and joined calls by business groups for tough action against the unions.
The South Korean government has declared the two-day-old strike illegal and ordered the arrest of 36 union leaders. Dozens of union activists have taken refuge at Myongdong Cathedral in Seoul or gone into hiding.
Kim Jae-Gil, head of the 25,000-member Korean Railway Workers' Union, and 70 other union leaders have been in hiding since Sunday.
Some 8,000 state workers are blockaded by riot police in two Seoul university campuses with hundreds of unionists with steel pipes on guard ahead of planned rallies. Police helicopters dropped leaflets on the campuses urging the unionists to go back to work.
While the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) held talks with the government, the rival KCTU warned it would call out more workers if the government rejected demands to stop privatization, cut working hours and increase pay.
The strike forced the cancellation of an estimated 60 percent of rail services, but the government has mobilized non-union workers to keep power stations open.
Extra buses and planes have been brought into service, but commuters have had to fight their way onto the rare trains heading into Seoul. Roads into the capital and other major cities have been choked with cars.
As public anger grows newspapers urged the government to take action.
Five employers associations issued a joint statement urging "firm action including the use of police against illegal strikes". The employers said the strike was a union challenge to test the government ahead of the football World Cup finals this year and two key elections.
School authorities at the two Seoul universities where striking workers are camped asked police to drive the unionists out of the campuses.
But President Kim Dae-Jung called for patience in handling the unrest.
"We need utmost patience in dialogue with unions, although illegal and violent acts must be sternly dealt with," Kim told a cabinet meeting.
The government said 8,700 workers, or 29 percent of 30,000 unionists at railway and power services, had joined the strike while unions put the figure at 16,000 workers, including 5,400 at power firms.

Finland, Muutoksen kevat  English summary
The most urgent environmental question in Finland at this moment is the decision about future energy strategies. Against the main current development of energy production, the Finnish industrialist lobby has applied for the construction of the fifth nuclear reactor in Finland. The last time such a discussion was going on here was ten years ago, and then the application was dropped. I guess nobody told them that No Means No. Situation is a lot different this time, however. An effectively working network of NGOs has started a combined campaign against the nuclear reactor, drawing a surprising amount of people on the streets to protest.
The last bigger demonstration was held at the Finnish parliament in mid-February, and according to reliable estimates it drew 1000 participants, a big figure in Finland. Previous mass protests have raised similar amounts of people. (As a comparison, the largest animal rights demos of mid 90's rallied about 400-500 people at most.)

Finland, Muutoksen kevat  English summary The most urgent environmental question in Finland at this moment is the
decision about future energy strategies. Against the main current
development of energy production, the Finnish industrialist lobby has
applied for the construction of the fifth nuclear reactor in Finland. The
last time such a discussion was going on here was ten years ago, and then
the application was dropped. I guess nobody told them that No Means No.
Situation is a lot different this time, however. An effectively working
network of NGOs has started a combined campaign against the nuclear
reactor, drawing a surprising amount of people on the streets to protest.
The last bigger demonstration was held at the Finnish parliament in
mid-February, and according to reliable estimates it drew 1000
participants, a big figure in Finland. Previous mass protests have raised
similar amounts of people. (As a comparison, the largest animal rights
demos of mid 90's rallied about 400-500 people at most.) The final
decision should be made this spring, and with it the future framework of
energy production will be drawn. Decisions on renewable forms of energy
are thus hanging in the air with the nuclear card. It is no surprise that
the situation has (literally) electrified the whole diverse political
field from mainstream realpolitik to the multitude of grassroots actors.
 From the viewpoint of the new political movements this is not just about
energy politics, however. Every intensive stage in such struggles
functions also as a rallying ground - a window of opportunity during
which new people engage themselves in grassroots politics, learn a lot,
both intellectually and practically, meet new people and start seeing
connections between issues that had seemed apart from each other. Like in
this case, one can see the connections of the nuclear issue to the
questions on economic and production growth (and the assumed
inevitability of them), to the forest issues via renewable fuels, to the
decisions between centralised or localised technology, environmental
safety etc. In many ways, the protests at Praque, Gothenburg and Genova
were such rallying points for a lot of people around here. Political movements need such struggles to keep up their momentum, and to
be able to shed the burden of rutinisation and "activist
carriers" - an intensive campaign is a wake-up call. The question is
what those 1000 people are going to do after this? Will they continue
political action or not? And most importantly: if the application for the
reactor goes through, will there be people who are willing to keep up the
struggle? The refugee and immigrant issue is another thing that came to the fore

Penalty Imposed for Illegal Export of Encryption Software The Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) has imposed a $95,000 civil penalty on Neopoint, Inc., of San Diego, California, to settle allegations that the company exported encryption software to South Korea in violation of U.S. export control laws. BXA charged that, on ten occasions between March 1998 and June 1999, Neopoint exported 128-bit encryption software to two firms in South Korea without the required export licenses. In all but one of these shipments, BXA alleged that Neopoint knew that an export license was required. Neopoint cooperated fully with BXA's investigation of the charges. "This case demonstrates that the U.S. Government can and will enforce its export controls on encryption products," said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Michael J. Garcia. BXA administers and enforces export controls on dual-use items and technology for reasons of national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, and short supply. Criminal penalties and administrative sanctions can be imposed for violations of the Export Administration Regulations. Assistant Secretary Garcia commended Special Agent Lou VanZant, from BXA's Los Angeles Field Office, who investigated this case.

Feyerabend was probably the first philosopher of science who really stated that science as it is practised by scientists themselves is NOT an enterprise which can be strictly constructed or even fully described in any conventional methodical way such as the philosophies of positivism and even rationality or idealism for that matter propose. As is true for any human enterprise, no matter how strongly this is denied by the popular science press, it is, as Feyerabend puts it, an anarchic enterprise, this does not mean random chaos or a process with no order rather he refers to the fact that scientists just as authors of great literature or poets, pursue their subject via many paths rather than the strict methodologies which are supposed to define science, in fact these methodologies fail to be `...capable of accounting for such a maze of interactions'. Einstein is noted as saying that `The external conditions which are set for the scientist by the facts of experience do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted, in the construction of his conceptual world, by the adherence to an epistemological system'. Feyerabend goes on to say that `The attempt...to discover the secrets of nature and of man, entails, therefore, the rejection of all universal standards and of all rigid "Orgone box for sale,suitable for Tesla experiment or hydroponics."kill the

"Imagine for a moment that as ordinary citizens were watching the evening news, they see an act by a government employee or officeholder that they feel violates their rights, abuses the public's trust, or misuses the powers that they feel should be limited. A person whose actions are so abusive or improper that the citizenry shouldn't have to tolerate it. What if they could go to their computers, type in the miscreant's name, and select a dollar amount: The amount they, themselves, would be willing to pay to anyone who "predicts" that officeholder's death. That donation would be sent, encrypted and anonymously, to a central registry organization, and be totaled, with the total amount available within seconds to any interested individual. If only 0.1% of the population, or one person in a thousand, was willing to pay $1 to see some government slimeball dead, that would be, in effect, a $250,000 bounty on his head."Saint Jim of Lompoc.

I have long suspected that any Brixton policeman must be an anarchist to survive. Now I know for sure. The commander of the Lambeth Metropolitan Police Division has admitted it.
Londoners will know Commander Brian Paddick. He is a metropolitan celebrity. He has pioneered tolerance of recreational drug use, from realism as much as from conviction. Openly gay, his patronage of the Urban75 agitprop website has generated a burst of chatline threads, most of them adulatory and unique in police communication. Mr Paddick is no Dixon of Dock Green.
But an anarchist? Can a policeman seriously proffer an absence of law as a basis for social order? His signature, "Brian: the Commander", is explicit. "The concept of Anarchism has always appealed to me,"...MORE

@_subject: New List," how to get the boss class to fight itself" 
This is a new unmoderated discussion list for activists and working people who are interesting in talking about labor, class, and work in the 21st century. As many of us know from daily experience, the nature of capitalism has dramatically changed from the last time a mass labor movement existed to challenge it. We have also seen the tremendous gains that the anti-capitalist movements have made in challenging and discrediting globalization and other new capitalist schemes. Despite the rhetoric about an alliance between Teamsters and Turtles, the techniques and methods of the new direct action movements have been slow to translate into the world of the workplace. Possible topics for discussion on this list: * working with and/or subverting traditional unions * the changing nature of capitalism * building solidarity networks * anti-sexist and anti-racist organizing within our struggle * new methods of organizing * workplace sabotage and subversion * using new forms of direct action in the workplace * creative methods of promoting class war * how to get the boss class to fight itself This list is for people who want to think outside of the box and throw everything on the table. This is not strictly an anarchist list--a multiplicity of views is encouraged. This list is not moderated, but you have to be a member to post to it. To subscribe: "...ironically, perhaps, the best organized dissenters in the world today are anarchists, who are busily undermining capitalism while the rest of the left is still trying to form committees." -- Jeremy Hardy, The Guardian (UK)

@_subject: Italian Indymedia update.Boycott spaggetti! 
THE ITALIAN JOB "In my opinion these raids were meant to intimidate some of the only independent media in the country. Now that Berlusconi has given more money to RAI, the Italian equivalent of the BBC, he has direct control or influence over 90% of Italian print and radio media, state owned or otherwise." - Indymedia spokesperson. On Wednesday morning, the Carabinieri (Italian paramilitary police) raided three social centres that were partly being used as offices for Indymedia. Two attorneys from Genoa gave the order for the nation-wide operation in which police seized computers, archives, and equipment as part of an ongoing enquiry investigating the events of last summers anti G8 protest in Genoa. The raid was meant to confiscate footage and info on the brutal police raid of two buildings during the protests (see SchNEWS 314/315). These were being used for accommodation, medical, media and legal services by protestors and the raids received international condemnation. Amnesty and the United Nations have each ordered independent enquiries into police conduct. One of the social centres raided was the Cobas Trade Union centre, which with over 10,000 members is the biggest of its kind in Italy. During the raids police confiscated over 160 hours of original video footage of the protests including film of the murder of Carlo Gulliani by police and the school raid. Two days ago Itallian Defence minister Skajola admitted that he did in fact give the order of 'shoot to kill' if any sizeable number of people moved into the red zone during the protests. A spokesperson from Indymedia told SchNEWS, "It's not likely that they will use the stuff they've nicked from Indymedia to properly investigate and try the police for murder and excessive violence. We reckon they'll just use it to identify and arrest more protestors...they already have loads of cctv footage of the protests, why else would they need ours too?" Indymedia was established in Seattle to cover the protests against the World Trade Organisation, and the idea has now spread across the world. In the Berlusconi controlled media world of Italy, Indymedia is one of the few independants - during the G8 demonstrations they were getting over one million hits a day. A demonstration will take place at the Italian embassy in London on Saturday. There will also be a demo in Rome on March, 16th.  Check out  for updates.

@_subject: Pakistan peasants are revolting. 
AVIN' A PEASANT TIME During the 1970's a number of peasant struggles started in Pakistan, with the most successful and militant land-grab taking place in Hashtnangar, an area close to the Pakistan-Afghan border. Organised by the Mazdoor Kissan Party (MKP), the peasants were able to liberate the area from feudal land-owners, who had always brutally oppressed the poor with the full backing of the state. Since those days, Hashtnagar remains a liberated area despite several attempts by the state to evict the peasants, with nearly 300 people losing their lives in 30 years of conflict. Taking advantage of the "War-Against-Terrorism" hysteria, the Pakistani government is once again trying to take-over the lands of Hashtnagar. They also aim to retake Okkara, Khanewal, Sargodha and Pak-pattan in other parts of the country in order to reverse gains made by the peasant movement in Pakistan over the past 10 years.. On 22nd January, 3,500 police armed with guns, tear-gas shells, armoured vehicles and jeeps attacked the village. Tractors were used to destroy peasant crops. MKP party activists and students surrounded the armoured vehicles to stop them firing into the crowd. Police attacked another village several kilometers away in the hope that they would have an easier time of it since the men of the village weren't around. The peasant women attacked the convoy and again the police had to retreat. The same night police arrested a peasant leader called Gulab Gul. In retaliation peasants attacked a police convoy, capturing some police officers, before going on to raid the police station where Gul was being held. Peasants then threatened to burn down the police station if their leader was not released! The entire area was surrounded by police arresting people who hadn't even participate in the fighting. 16 arrests were made in total, 8 of which were of people so old they couldn't even walk properly without support. The situations is very tense and may erupt into full scale armed conflict at any time.

@_subject: Plenty of room at the hotel Kalifornia. 
We received word from Rob 'Ruckus' Middaugh, Anarchist Political Prisoner in the United States informing us that additional federal charges are going to placed against him. These charges are in addition to the previous charges relating from the Long Beach attacks by the police during a May Day march in 2001, where he was arrested and convicted to 3 years for assualt on a police officer. Apparently the FBI had an arrest warrent issued against Rob for an incident in Sacramento. He did not mention what that action was but what we do know is that the charges are the following: Forcibly assaulting a police officer (fedral charge), wearing a mask with intent to commit a crime (state charge), and weapons related charge (state charge). With these new charges, Middaugh could be facing 25 years to life due to what is known as the 3-strikes law in the state of California. Under this law, certain crimes are considered strikable offenses. When three or more of these crimes are committed by an individual that person can/will be sent to prison for 25 years to life. All charges that Robert Middaugh has received have been during political action. The first strike was during the protest against the Democratic National Convention where he was accused of being the leader of the Black Block. The second strike was during the Long Beach incident where he and 100 other anarchist were arrested during an attack by police on May Day. These new charges could add his third strike. No news has been received as to when his trial will happen but we will keep everyone informed as soon as we here. We encourage everyone to write to Rob and let him know he is supported!!!!

SPAIN IN THE ARSE
"Terrorism is not only a group of commandos who act, but is a project
that tries to root itself in society, and to combat it, it is also
necessary to struggle against the social, economical, political and also
communication structures which support and nourish it" - Jaime Mayor
Oreha, Spanish Minister of Internal Affairs.
When Oreha spoke at the European Conference on Terrorism in Madrid in
January last year his government was already cracking down on Spanish
citizens' civil liberties; long before September 11th and the beginning
of an international 'war on terrorism'. In the past year alone, belonging
to the wrong political party, supporting prisoners, teaching the Basque
language, publishing books and records, editing a magazine, being in a
band, running a radio station, or simply being a journalist has become a
crime in Spain. There have been mass arrests with people taken to
isolation wards where they are often tortured then released a few days
later without charge. This targeting of Basque political activists has
now spread to anarchist and other radical movements, with raids and
arrests being part of a general clampdown.
        Euro nicked!
No surprises then to find that Spain is using its presidency of the
European Union to push forward radical proposals that would label
demonstrators at European summits 'terrorists'. The document, issued last
month to the European Working Party on Terrorism, states that they have
"noticed a gradual increase...in violence and criminal damage (at
anti-capitalist protests) orchestrated by radical extremist groups,
clearly terrorising society." The proposals go on to state that this 'new
breed' of terrorist menace are "organisations taking advantage of their
lawful status to aid and abet the achievement of terrorist groups' aims."
Post September 11th, the European Union agreed new legislation for
combating global terrorism, along with a European arrest warrant. The
Spanish proposals go further, asking for a more proactive EU wide
database to keep an eye on protestors. They reckon that this extension
"would provide a very helpful tool in preventing and, where appropriate,
prosecuting violent urban youthful radicalism, which is increasingly
being used as a cat's-paw by terrorist groups in order to achieve their
criminal aims."
But it's not just Spain that is widening the definition of terrorism; we
in the UK are 'fortunate' enough to be protected by some of the world's
toughest anti-terrorist legislation. Barrister Stephanie Harrison, from
the Campaign Against Criminalising Communities reckons that the Terrorist
Act 2000 (SchNEWS 268), alongside its even tougher little sister, the
Anti Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (see SchNews 331), are not
only criminalising dissent amongst the locals, but are a direct attack on
the rights of vulnerable groups - mainly immigrant communities.
Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, Leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain
told SchNEWS that the situation within the British Muslim and Arabic
community is becoming unbearable. "We are the target of this legislation
- there is a witch hunt going on - a fishing expedition... Innocent people
are being harassed, families are being disturbed, children traumatised...
there is a climate of fear in our community". And it doesn't stop there,
as new legislation allows instant internment, providing the police with
powers to detain people indefinitely without trial. Often based on the
most circumstantial of evidence, Asians and Muslims the length and breath
of this fair and pleasant land are finding themselves being detained
under this new legislation. Dr Siddiqui's message is clear "The whole
Muslim community is frightened, intimidated and traumatised; as a result
the people are not getting involved in community activities, and people
are asking 'is it worth it?'"
In January Yasadigimiz Vatan, a Turkish language socialist weekly
magazine had its last two issues confiscated by police who said it was
"property for the use of terrorism." Vatan has been distributed in the UK
for the past two years so what has changed? According to one of its
workers "The Terrorism Act 2000, which is not being used to fight
terrorism but to fight democrats and prevent press freedom in this
Estella Schmidt from the Kurdish National Congress (KNK) told us that as
far as UK based Kurds are concerned it is more a case of harassment than
actual detention. Demonstrators are constantly being filmed, and follow
up calls from police to homes of Kurds is commonplace often late at night
and unannounced."These people are not from this country, and despite
protesting innocently, and making it quite clear that they are not
supporting terrorists, they are still harassed by police - it is similar
to the way the Irish have been treated in the past."
As the Spanish example shows, it's not long before the authoritarian
finger starts pointing at anyone who dares to disagree. Raif, a lawyer
from Coalition Against the Terror Acts, told SchNEWS "With so much police
activity against refugees and Muslims, many people are becoming
complacent. This new document confirms exactly what we've been warning of
for ages. All effective dissent will be treated the same: you are either
with them or you are a terrorist and outlaw."

"...The involvement of the American Central Intelligence Agency in the downfall of the Gough Whitlam Labor government in 1975 and CIA use of intelligence from the American Pine Gap spy facilities (in Australia) are a conveniently neglected part of Australian history.
"It is quite obvious that information was being leaked about ministers Rex O'Connor and Jim Cairns and some of it was being forged which is a standard CIA process." -- Former CIA Agent, Ralph McGehee.
"The Task Force 157 was a group set up by Henry Kissinger and it was set up in a quite strange way.

"For Anarchy to succeed, or simply advance toward its success,it must be conceived not only as a lighthouse that illuminates and attracts,but as something possible and attainable,not in centuries to come,but in a relatively short time,and without relying on miracles." Errico Malatesta.

"...I am disturbed by the conservative tone of "Bakunin", who seems all about, as Bob Black said once, "venerat[ing] their victimized forebears with a morbid devotion which occasions suspicion that the anarchists, like everybody else, think the only good anarchist is a dead one." NEFAC, as well, troubles me in this respect with their near rabid defense of all things anarchist and 19th century (except the individualists, of course). Well, in case neither they nor "Bakunin" noticed, things are quite different now and, well, those revolutions failed. I do not enjoy seeing the role of anarchist as conservative played out like this.
Our role, as anarchists, is to carefully examine our history, look at its flaws and evaluate it in the context of the current situation. Has strict and formalized organization led to social revolution? No. Are these types of organizations subject to the same critique of power that political parties and states are? Yes. If we want a revolution that has a chance to survive, perhaps it's best to look around society and see what kinds of informal organization is already there and encourage and support those. Our revolution today is not going to look like the Spanish Revolution of '36 (except, hopefully, in the anti-work character of the working class). Those organizations, if they were ever relevant (and history suggests that they were not), are dinosaurs now.
Our role is not to force the working class into organizing along the lines of some anarchists tired concepts of organization. American workers have rejected both revolutionary unionism and its reformist counterpart. Let's not herd them back in. The political repression by the CNT on dissenters among the rank and file alone ought to caution against that.
As a short aside, I also recommend David F. Noble's "Progress Without People: In Defense of Luddism". Despite its name, it is a great history of workers autonomous, anti-organizational struggles within unions. This is a history we ought to be paying careful attention to because it's still being made all around us. It's just a little harder to see for those who rely on the Leftist habit of only recognizing revolt when its caged within parties, unions or federations.

In a decision welcomed historic by gay civil rights groups, Massachusetts's Supreme Court made a change in the existing sodomy laws. They ruled that those who engage in "sodomy" (thanks to Gregster, we know that they really mean anal sex, but are just confused with their terminology) in "semipublic places" cannot be prosecuted as long as they try to keep it private.

BUSH PROPOSAL FOR IMMEDIATE "TERMINATION"
OF MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMER TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTERS IS STILL A THREAT
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Bush is about to
appoint extremist psychiatrist Sally Satel to the
advisory board of the USA Center for Mental Health
Services, according to several reliable sources.
Satel is an American Enterprise Institute
psychiatrist whose own web site, book, interviews
and speeches directly attack the very idea of
mental health consumers and psychiatric survivors
organizing for self-determination and their human rights.
INSIDE SALLY SATEL'S "FORTRESS OF MEDICINE."
What's Dr. Satel's plan, instead? She promotes the
involuntary psychiatric drugging of thousands of
more Americans, including Americans living out in
the community in their own homes. Satel also feels
we should be called "patients." And that we should be
kept out of what she calls her "fortress of medicine."
[Actual phrase on Satel's own web site home page.]
The reports of Satel's pending appointment comes
on the heels of Bush's recently-proposed budget
that calls for immediate 100 percent "termination" of
mental health consumer technical assistance (TA) centers.
News update: A hoped-for one-year reprieve on the
"termination" of TA center funding was quickly withdrawn
by the USA Office of Management and Budget on a
"technicality," according to a spokesperson for one
of the TA Centers. The Bush administration is still
proposing immediate 100 percent "termination."

Bloody hard to run a forum in Sweden - Lawyer speaks
By Mikael Pawlo
Posted: 28/03/2002 at 15:59 GMT
(Mikael Pawlo is Associate, Advokatfirman Lindahl, working with Internet
law issues for Aftonbladet Nya Medier.
In a recent ruling by the district court of Stockholm, the publisher of the
Swedish daily Aftonbladet was found guilty of hate speech and sentenced to
a conditional sentence and fines. An anonymous user in a moderated forum on
the Aftonbladet web site uttered the hate speech.
It has been debated whether the speech was removed from the forum quickly
enough or not, but that is an issue not dealt with in this case. According
to the court the crime was committed immediately upon publication.
The legal situation in Sweden regarding freedom of speech on the Internet
is ambiguous. According to the laws regulating freedom of speech, the
publisher has a strict accountability for everything published in his
paper. Only during extreme circumstances should the publisher escape
accountability. When it comes to the Internet, the publisher of a web forum
can be held accountable if he is a registered publisher and works
for a media company.
All serious media companies in Sweden have a registered publisher for their
Internet editions. In the popular debate, it is often argued that the
accountability of the publisher should be
different depending on whether moderation is made before or after the
If the moderation is made after publication, the publisher should -
according to this line of reasoning - never be held accountable for the
speech published in the Internet forums. The law of freedom of expression
does not deal with this particular issue, and while there are no precedents
it is hard to tell with certainty what the law is. However, for commercial
and ethical reasons, few serious publishers would run an
un-moderated forum. Without moderation, the forums for a major publication
like Aftonbladet would contain massive amount of hate speech.
Why is this a problem? Should not the publisher be accountable for the web
edition in the same fashion he is responsible for the printed edition? You
could argue that a responsible publisher should not publish irresponsible
content, like hate speech. However, such an approach will carry some
negative aspects. This will inevitably lead to a situation where the free
speech aspects of the Internet are not embraced.
A publisher can easily edit five pieces submitted to an editorial or
opinion section in a printed edition, but he can not possibly edit 5.000
pieces submitted to the same section online. At least not if he will be
held strictly accountable for everything published.
Hence, this will lead to a more restrictive policy
on what will be published on the Internet. The 5,000 pieces can not be
published, since they need thorough editing. The debate among peers will
die or move to other forums, not run by serious and established
publishers. From an economical viewpoint, media companies aiming at a
higher standard for their forums through moderation will not be able to run
open forums in the same fashion non-media companies may. This will
create asymmetries in the market place. It is a side issue, but the all
companies running forums on the Internet should compete on the same terms,
notwithstanding legal technicalities.
I do not think the district court ruling was wrong in legal terms. However,
I think we need to consider the legal realities of Internet publication.
Maybe the law needs to be changed in order to preserve freedom of speech on
the Internet.
To me it makes sense to make every user responsible for his or her speech
combined with notice and takedown legislation. This will ultimately lead
to a situation where Internet anonymity can not be preserved. However, the
publisher should only disclose the identity of a user in extreme cases of
hate speech and other legally defined harmful content. The publisher should
be held liable upon non-removal of hate speech upon notification.
Notice and takedown policies are very hard to deal with in practice. A
publisher facing a notice and takedown challenge will in most cases remove
the content in question in order to escape responsibility. However, a
serious publisher can distinguish between non-contentious notices and
unreasonable notices. If the media companies and their publishers are held
accountable for everything published in their web forums we will soon face
an Internet where the possibility of a widened debate has been seriously
damaged by law. Let us grasp the uniqueness of the Internet before it is
gone. The Internet is not a newspaper. .

Despite threats of violence, resistance both inside and out remains strong
On a day that was marked by threats of violence against detainees at the Woomera Detention Centre by ACM, the Woomera2002 campsite began setting up across the road from the Federal Police and ACM roadblock which leads to the Detention Centre. The Area Administrator for Woomera attempted to get protesters to move to a location several kilometres futher away. Protesters decided to hold their ground, bolstered by a group of children yelling 'Feedom', who were driven into the Detention Centre. After some discussions to address environmental concerns, the Australian Protective Services (APS - the Federal Police) decided that they would no longer negotiate with the protesters. Protesters were told that they had to move to the location designated by the Woomera Area Administrator. Protesters refused to move. The APS then moved in and dismantled the Indymedia and the First Aid tents, after which they retreated. As of 8pm Thursday evening, protesters decided to stand their ground and stay the night.
LATE BREAKING NEWS: Just after 11pm, the APS moved in again. They tried to make a number of arrests, but were unable to do so.

The Virtual People Smuggler [ - as
is the case with 'people smuggling' generally - arose out of the need and
desire to cross borders. In the first instance, to cross the borders of
various noborder events and protests themselves, to create a space which was
an adequate expression of the movements for the freedom of movement.
Confined neither by geopolitical limits nor the standard aesthetics of
protests, the Virtual People Smuggler pays tribute to the chatrooms, spoof
sites, weblogs, online gaming, independent media as virtual, vital and,
therefore, actual moments in the crossing of borders. In other words, as the
experience encountered by people as they log in to virtual communities which
are unrestrained by national borders, and also, thereby, as one of the forms
in which protests (especially noborder protests and events) can and do
Crossing the distinction between 'virtual' and 'actual' (which denies the
experience of virtual communities and communication as real, as both
effective and affective), as well as celebrating the desire for freedom of
movement (which results not only in clandestine travel arranged by
people-smugglers in order to cross geopolitical borders, but also gave rise
to the most successful salespitch for internet software), the Virtual People
Smuggler asks, "Where do you want to go today?"

Now it plans to establish itself as the hub of the potentially lucrative market in space tourism.
InterOrbital Systems, a Californian company, says it has reached agreement with the Tongan Government to use one of the 170 islands, Eua, to launch rockets taking tourists into orbit at a cost of $US2 million ($3.8 million) a head for week-long trips, beginning in 2005.
This week it announced its first customer: Wally Funk, a 62-year-old Texan woman who trained with the astronauts in the United States's Mercury program but was not sent into outer space. "When I was rejected by the Mercury program, I knew one day I'd be a paying passenger," she said. Her ticket buys 60 days of training in a "resort setting", followed by the holiday of a lifetime in InterOrbital's Neptune Orbital Spaceliner craft.
"It will be capable of placing two astronaut-pilots and four astronaut-tourists into ... orbit for a period of up to seven days," InterOrbital says.
The reusable rockets InterOrbital is developing can be launched at sea or from a land-based space port.
Frank Sietzen, president of the Space Transportation Association, which foresees an eventual space-tourism income of $US10-20 billion a year, said that a ticket income of $US8 million a flight was unlikely to pay for the required technology.
"The only viable space tourism at the moment is riding the Russian Soyuz, and the price for that is more than $US20 million." That was the amount paid by the first, and so far the only space tourist, the US millionaire Dennis Tito, last April.

@_subject: FOUND! A decent "group of lawyers." 
"I do not believe that police, acting in good faith, have been supported by courts and the juries."
One of Victoria's most senior police officers said a dramatic increase in civil litigation meant some police were increasingly uncomfortable performing operational duties because of fears of being sued.
Retired Deputy Commissioner Neil O'Loughlin (pictured right) said a group of lawyers had become parasites who saw the force as a "cash cow", and continually searched for new ways to sue police.
He said millions of dollars that should be spent on street policing was now being used to pay legal bills.
Since 1994, police have paid out $15 million in civil payments and $7 million in legal costs. There is now a backlog of 140 cases - the oldest relating to an arrest in 1985.
The police department has budgeted to pay a minimum of $10 million on pending actions. Increasingly police are settling cases rather than risking big payouts and large legal bills.
"I do not believe that police, acting in good faith, have been supported by courts and the juries," Mr O'Loughlin said. "We have made mistakes but we have still been found liable when our actions have not been negligent."
Mr O'Loughlin, who retired on Friday after 41 years' service, said some law firms had been touting for business, checking law lists for cases where people have been charged with assaulting police and then contacting them with the offer of a free legal consultation with the view of suing the force.
"We have had cases where people involved in unlawful demonstrations have damaged property and when police have moved in they have ended up being sued," he said.
He said in one case police were sued after a doctor filled out the wrong form in certifying a mentally ill patient. The writ blamed police after they did not take the man directly to the hospital.
"This sort of a thing is a nonsense. We are following the trends of the American system."
Mr O'Loughlin said that when police won a case they often could not recover their costs because the plaintiffs did not have the resources to pay. In one recent action, police won their case but were left with $80,000 costs because the plaintiff had no assets.
Mr O'Loughlin said some demonstrators went to protest meetings with a plan to confront police and then sue. "Many of those who sue are not looking for justice, only easy money," he said.
The chief executive of the Law Institute of Victoria, Ian Dunn, rejected Mr O'Loughlin's claims.
"The law has not changed, it is just in the past police have not used pressure-point tactics and would not strip search everyone in a nightclub," he said.
Police have been found liable in civil cases for using pressure holds against demonstrators at the Richmond Secondary College and for strip-searching patrons at the Tasty nightclub.
Mr Dunn said: "If police do not exceed their powers they are no more vulnerable than they have ever been."

@_subject: Trall, issue #22 - Organising against capitalism in the 21st 
opening address to the "anarchist
  odyssey" conference in christchurch,
  october 2001
  Capitalism is under challenge for the first time
  in decades. From PNG [Papua New Guinea]
  to Prague, Seattle to South Africa there is a
  growing movement against the instruments of
  capitalist globalisation - the World Economic
  Forum, and the Bretton Woods Institutions
  (the International Monetary Fund and World
  Bank which Leigh Cookson will talk about
  soon).
  anarchism is order capitalism is
  chaos
  Capitalism is the system of private ownership
  of the big things in life (or the means of
  production as they're more often called). It's
  taken us to a point where 3 people are
  wealthier than the poorest 48 countries. Call
  us crazy but we think a system where half the
  world's population annual income is equal to
  the wealth of world's 225 richest people is
  unjust and will continue to sow bitterness,
  hatred war and terrorism.
  While mainstream media talk of 'anarchy'
  erupting whenever warlords who are not 'our'
  warlords go on a chaotic rampage we repeat
  again and again anarchy is not chaos.
  Anarchy is order, capitalism is chaos.
  Anarchism is not about 'doing your own thing',
  it's not solely concerned with individuality
  although the creeping ideology of me-ism is
  gaining ground in our consumer culture.
  Anarchism is a movement, it is a praxis -
  which means theory into action. Anarchism is
  a strand of socialism with a history of over
  150 years.
  the struggle against forgetting
  A lot of people say "why bother with history,
  who cares what a bunch of dead white males
  with long beards did". While it's true that
  history, even radical history has been very
  eurocentric and male oriented we need to
  know our history - not His-story but Our-story.
  Not of the kings and queens but of the People.
  This knowledge is nourishing and sustaining.
  You are not alone. Things are not as bad as
  they may seem. Things that seem impossible
  are achievable. You are not the spaceman on
  the poster for this conference - alone,
  isolated, on another planet. You are part of a
  movement.
  Milan Kundera said "the struggle of people
  against power is the struggle of memory
  against forgetting". Or as King Kapisi says
  "Fix Amnesia".
  We are asked to forget that the CIA put $6
  billion dollars into training Muslim
  fundamentalists in Afghanistan. We are asked
  to forget that it was the Labour Party that
  privatised Air New Zealand in the first place.
  We are asked to forget the colonialism that
  has built the wealth of Western nations. We
  are asked to forget that the only terrorism this
  country has seen was done by the French
  State against Greenpeace. And we are asked
  to forget the people's struggles that have
  given us the hard won breathing space and
  relative freedoms we enjoy today. And mostly
  we obey by forgetting.
  Our first step in organising against capitalism
  in the 21st century is to reclaim the knowledge
  that past generations possessed and
  understand it ourselves. We should gain
  courage in the fact that people have struggled
  and won piece by piece.
  o 600 years ago we were owned by lords
  o 200 years ago the working class could not
  vote
  o just over 100 years ago women could not
  vote
  o in Australia just 30 years ago Aboriginal
  people could not vote
  o though economic apartheid still exists South
  Africa threw off racial apartheid only 10 years
  ago
  o 5 years ago East Timorese independence
  was considered a 'lost cause' and the Suharto
  regime in Indonesia seemed immovable
  o 4 years ago the IMF and World Bank could
  meet in safety without turning the host city into
  a police state
  I tell you this not to glorify the vote as the
  pinnacle of achievement but to realise that the
  thirst for freedom is unstoppable and it will
  always continue despite oppression. You may
  think I'm being a bit dramatic talking of
  oppression while in safe and relatively affluent
  Aotearoa but notice that the ozone hole is the
  most dangerous its ever been, we stand on
  the brink of a possible world war, and as 1951
  shows us democratic freedoms are paper thin
  in times of crisis.
  1951 for those too young to know was when it
  was made illegal, right here in Aotearoa, to
  talk in public in support of the wharfies union,
  or to give food to a wharfie or their family or
  even to discuss the law that made all these
  things illegal. The wharfies crime was to
  refuse to work more than 40 hours a week.
  That's why we need to learn and understand
  our history, our context. When we understand
  our context we can start to clarify our vision
  for the future, which is desperately needed
  work. Anarchists like Bookchin and Michael
  Albert are doing this with Social Ecology and
  Participatory Economics. But vision cannot be
  built without context.
  join the greens? nope...
  And to put things in context the anti-capitalist
  globalisation movement did not begin in
  Seattle and terrorism didn't start on
  September 11 2001. I want to talk about three
  September 11's that put anarchist politics into
  a context. People often say, OK there's
  problems with the system, why not correct
  them by creating or joining a political party.
  Many young people disillusioned with the
  system are joining the Greens. And yet even
  the Greens themselves will admit that while
  they are not part of the government they can
  make as many good sounding noises they
  want but the minute they are in the
  government it will be a different story as many
  disappointed Alliance supporters have found
  out.
  I suggest looking at the German Greens who
  started out fairly radical. Joschka Fischer was
  an anarchist 20 years ago and is now the
  Vice Chancellor and foreign minister of
  Germany. The German Greens have gone
  from espousing non-violence as a main
  principle to cheerleading the US bombing of
  Afghanistan. The US, Joschka Fischer
  explains, is the only country with a big enough
  stick to enforce peace in Europe. This is not
  just a matter of the German Greens lacking
  moral fortitude - it's a systematic problem that
  faces all parties.
  The NZ Labour Party started out calling for
  public ownership of the means of production
  and ended up overseeing the fastest and
  most wide ranging privatisation in the world
  (as Murray Horton will no doubt explain in
  tomorrow's workshop on who owns New
  Zealand). Labour are pushing for capitalist
  globalisation by stealth through free trade
  agreements like the Hong Kong Free Trade
  Agreement as Bill Rosenberg will explain in
  one of this afternoons workshops.
  september 11 the first
  But what if a party managed to stay true to its
  radical roots? That's where the first
  September 11 comes in. September 11 1973.
  Has anyone read any books by Isabelle
  Allende? Her uncle was Salvador Allende. In
  Chile Salvador Allende's National Alliance was
  a Marxist Party that had a programme of
  redistribution of power and resources to the
  poor. They were the first democratically
  elected Marxist Party in the world. But
  corporations didn't like that - in fact ITT put up
  $1 million to help overthrow Salvador Allende.
  The CIA didn't like it either. Henry Kissenger
  and President Nixon told the CIA it would be
  necessary to "make the Chilean economy
  scream". Kissenger said "I don't see why we
  need to stand around and watch a country go
  communist because of the irresponsibility of
  its own people".
  And so, on September 11 1973 in a CIA
  backed military coup the Salvador Allende
  government was toppled, the parliament
  bombed, thousands rounded up and taken to
  football stadiums and shot and General
  Pinochet came to power preaching the free
  market policies of his advisor US economist
  Milton Friedman, hero of Thatcher, Reagan
  and NZ Labour Party Rogernomics.
  Two years later the Whitlam govt. in Australia
  was toppled by less dramatic but still devious
  means. These days the power of global
  capital is so great they probably won't have to
  use such naked aggression to get rid of
  people that threaten their power.
  But the lesson of September 11 1973 is clear
  - if a government could truly change things
  they would be removed - by force if necessary
  - so we see the real struggle is not to gain
  power but redistribute it, decentralise it,
  democratise it.
  september 11 the second
  Which leads to
  the second
  September 11,
  S11 2000
  where over
  10,000
  protesters successfully blockaded the Crown
  Casino in Melbourne where the 1000 richest
  corporations were meeting under the banner
  of the World Economic Forum. Despite brutal
  attacks by the police the blockade stayed solid
  and non-violent which was a key to its
  success.
  There were two main organising blocks at S11
  - the S11 Alliance and S11 AWOL (AWOL
  standing for Autonomous Web of Liberation).
  The S11 Alliance took it upon themselves to
  be THE organisers of the blockade and
  organised marshalls with the view that
  decisions during the 3 days would be made by
  majority vote at mass meetings. The two
  largest marxist groups in Australia - the DSP
  [Democratic Socialist Party, pro-Cuba
  Leninists] and the ISO [International Socialist
  Organisation, Trotskyists] were vying for
  control of many of the positions within S11
  Alliance.
  S11 AWOL participants, on the other hand,
  argued for protesters organising themselves
  in a self managed blockade through affinity
  groups facilitated by a spokescouncil to which
  each affinity group would send a delegate.
  The S11 AWOL groups organised most of the
  medical and legal teams. Their organisational
  methods reflected not only anarchist praxis,
  and the so-called 'Seattle' approach but of
  how the peace and environment movement in
  Australia has evolved its direct action
  strategies over the last 20 years.
  Tensions between centralised vs
  decentralised organising were minimised on
  September 11 because of the success of the
  blockade but grew that evening when on at
  least one picket marshalls were telling people
  to disband because other pickets were
  leaving. It was clear though, through the
  affinity networks, that this was not true. So a
  feeling grew that marshalls were not to be
  trusted and later when a marshall warned of
  an impending attack by riot police they were
  ignored and the picket unfortunately sustained
  the highest number of injuries of any picket
  over the period.
  Some argue that anarchists insistence on the
  right to autonomous action destroys unity and
  ignores collective action. But let's look at the
            reality of this - the anarchists
            merely acknowledge the fact
            that while our unity is a strength,
            people will not do what
            someone tells them to do if they
            don't see a good reason to do
            it.
            Both the DSP and the ISO
  wanted unity and democratic centralism but
  they both wanted their democratic centralism,
  to the point where on the victory march around
  Melbourne whey were continually fighting over
  the route of the rally and attempting to lead
  protesters in different directions. We all
  recognise the need for a strong movement
  against the corporate capitalist beast and
  recognise our need to work with others who
  do not share in all our visions for the future
  and our organisational methods. But this is
  why the movement is decentralised, diverse
  and flexible - organising in ways that are in
  harmony with anarchist principles. And that's
  why we are anarchists and not Trotskyists.
  september 11 the third
  Which leads to the third September 11, this
  years terrorist attacks on the US where 5000
  ordinary working people lost their lives. In the
  wake of that event seemingly everything has
  changed. So which way forward? The very
  real gains of the anti-capitalist globalisation
  movement are now in danger of being lost
  along with our civil liberties. Lets not also lose
  our nerve. Self censorship is an ugly thing to
  see. We need to do a few things:
  (1) We've got to see the context to this war -
  500 years of colonialism
  (2) We must condemn terrorism in all its
  forms - you can't blow up a social relationship
  and no amount of bombing will stop terrorism
  or end exploitation.
  (3) Link global justice with global peace - there
  will be no peace while injustice grows and the
  capitalist vision of free market madness will
  only increase hunger and exploitation. The
  demands of Dropping All Third World Debt
  and Abolishing the IMF and World Bank
  should be incorporated into any peace and
  justice movement.
  There is a plenary session tomorrow morning
  to further discuss planning for actions against
  the WTO and the war.
  Finally we need to build the new world in the
  shell of the old. In building this movement the
  internet has been crucial and in itself is a
  great metaphor. Created by the US military for
  nuclear warfare it now is the very
  decentralised and non-hierarchical network
  that we are using to help connect the so called
  first and third world struggles.
  While mainstream media have either covered
  this movement inaccurately or not at all an
  international decentralised non-hierarchical
  media network called IndyMedia has both
  covered and participated in the movement and
  spread to over 60 centres around the world.
  What better way to challenge the media than
  to become the media. In tomorrow's workshop
  on community media you'll hear how this
  network spans the globe using open source
  free software developed collaboratively and
  decentrally by anarchists.

BEIJING - Profound labor unrest shook two cities in northern China's "rust belt" Wednesday as unpaid and laid off workers protested, overturning a car and massing 10,000-strong to face off with military police.
In Liaoyang, an industrial center in northeastern Liaoning province, columns of military police protected the city government office - on Democracy Road - and broke up protests.
Witnesses, who estimated the crowd at 10,000, said there were no injuries, but city officials denied there were any protests at all.
"Nothing has happened. It's quiet outside," said a spokesman at the Liaoyang city office.
Hundreds of armed officers were reportedly blanketing the area and ringing the building around the clock.
In Daqing, a famed oil town in northern China's frigid Heilongjiang province, witnesses said workers - many of them laid off - demonstrated in front of the provincial branch of China National Petroleum Corp. when a traffic accident took place.
Protesters surged forward and overturned a gray Chinese-made Santana, one witness said. It was not clear who was inside the vehicle.
"I don't know what happened to the victims and the driver," said a traffic police officer reached by telephone. He did not give his name.
Thousands of shouting protesters gathered again Thursday in front of government offices to demand the release of four detained labor leaders, witnesses said.
Witnesses said three of the leaders were detained Wednesday while trying to negotiate with officials in Liaoyang, an industrial city in Liaoning province. The other, Yao Fuxin, was detained Sunday near his home, a labor rights group said.
One participant, a woman reached by cell phone while demonstrating, said the crowd was pushing at a large iron gate in front of Liaoyang city hall. She and other witnesses said no one has been injured.
Such demonstrations, which have been growing in the region since early this month, are unusual in China, where the government keeps a tight rein on protests and uses threats and force to discourage any anti-government However, the government has also acknowledged that workers, once revered as the "vanguard of the proletariat," are suffering from widespread closures of inefficient and outdated state firms.
"Owed salaries and severance payments are just part of the reason. The real problem is that the life of laid-off workers is too difficult," said Ma, a Liaoyang resident who works for a private factory but knows many of the protesters. He gave only his surname.
"People are angry because they feel the government used them and then threw them away," Ma said.
Protesters carried red banners and a portrait of Mao Zedong mounted on a small chariot. One banner said, "Laid-off workers of the Ferroalloy Factory protest against factory bankruptcy and demand payment of owed salaries," said the woman, who refused to give her name.
She said the number of protesters had increased by several thousand since Monday, with throngs crowding Democracy Road and the narrow streets nearby each morning. She said the protests have been peaceful so far, but "such a big crowd of protesters really shocked us."
Ma, the worker from the Jian An Machine Factory, said protests began with workers from Liaoyang Ferroalloy Factory but expanded this week to include laid off workers from other plants.
Farmers even joined in to protest not being paid by bankrupt factories that were built on their lands, said Ma. Protesters are angry at Liaoyang Ferroalloy Factory for refusing to pay workers severance pay of $500 a year. Ma said former workers feel they were cheated by factory managers in collusion with corrupt local officials.

UNTIL FREEDOM IS WON! UPDATE ON THE PELTIER CAMPAIGN FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE
INCLUDED IN THIS MESSAGE: Updates on the Motion to Reduce Leonard's Sentence, Progress Made Toward Obtaining New Evidence, Civil Rights Case, Government Reform Committee
Dear Friends,
We are writing today with both good and bad news on the case of Leonard Peltier. But before we begin we want to thank all of you who have been sponsoring LPDC speakers and organizing Peltier events in your communities. Raising awareness continues to be essential and supporters have organized several successful events. Let's keep the LPDC speakers bureau busy and word of Leonard's case flowing! We also want to let you know that there will be three important events on June 26 marking 27 years since the shoot-out occurred. They include gatherings in Oglala, South Dakota, San Francisco, California and Boston, Massachusetts. We encourage you to plan on attending one of these events or organizing something in your community. More details will be released soon.
BAD NEWS, BUT NOT SURPRISING We regret to announce that the motion to reduce Leonard's sentence was denied by the U.S. District Court of North Dakota. We expected this case to be a challenge because of the many procedural obstacles it involved combined with the political nature of the Peltier case, especially in this district. However, we had hoped for more fairness given that Judge Benson, who tried Leonard, is no longer hearing Judge Magnison denied the motion without a hearing based upon issues of timeliness. A motion to reduce sentence is supposed to be filed within a year following a conviction. However, we argued that filing at this late date was justified because of significant developments that occurred since trial, citing cases in which exceptions had been made due to extraordinary circumstances. The court said that the significant developments in question (government admission that it can't prove who shot agents/ballistics) had already been litigated. Judge Magnison refused to consider these issues despite the clearly different character of the case, which sought a review of sentence and not a new trial like before. Attorney Eric Seitz is appealing the decision to the Eighth Circuit.
NOW WHAT? We MUST obtain new evidence and demand a new trial for Leonard Peltier. We are confident that key evidence exists in the thousands of documents that are withheld by the FBI and fortunately, we are moving closer to obtaining them.
GOOD NEWS! Thanks to the persistent letters of supporters in Massachusetts, Representative Barney Frank wrote to the FBI insisting that the withheld documents be released given Clinton's Executive Order requiring the disclosure of documents after the passage of 25 years. The FBI Office of Public and Congressional Affairs responded by saying, "After receipt of your letter.the FBI consulted with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to request that the investigative records pertaining to Mr. Peltier that are 25 years or older be considered of significant historical interest subject to declassification review. NARA agreed and the process of declassification review has begun. Upon completion, the material will be accessioned to NARA and a declassified copy will be provided to your office. We anticipate completion of this project by the end of the year." Attorney Mike Kuzma, who is handling Leonard's FOIA requests, wrote to NARA to learn when the declassification would be completed. Mike also asked that he be provided copies of the documents. NARA responded, "We have been informed that the records are still in the physical and legal custody of the FBI. The FBI has completed its declassification review and is currently processing the records for transfer to NARA and their subsequent public release. The transfer is expected to occur in May of this year. Following the transfer, NARA may require additional time to prepare for the public release of the records." This is a very positive development for us and strengthens our chances for obtaining new information. Furthermore, the documents are now protected against destruction because of their historical classification. The battle is not over, as we expect the documents to be partly censored for reasons of "national security" like before. But, we plan to demand the full release and exposure of the documents in court.
It should also be noted that Mike Kuzma continues to pursue the documents through the Freedom of Information Act process. Requests have been submitted to FBI headquarters and numerous field offices across the country. With the exception of Portland, Oregon, all offices have reported that they possess records. We anticipate filing one or several suits to demand the release of these documents in the near future. Mike Kuzma is also working with law students involved in the Innocence Project of Osgoode Hall and the LPDC of Canada to obtain documents generated around the MORE GOOD NEWS! The civil rights complaint against the FBI has been drafted and the finishing touches are being added now. This case argues that the FBI violated Leonard's Constitutional Rights by lying to the Department of Justice, former President Clinton, the Parole Commission, and the public with the sole intention of denying Leonard fair clemency and parole reviews, thus costing him his long deserved freedom. We plan to do a major press blitz on the day the case is filed and we will need your participation. This is our chance to undo much of the disinformation disseminated by the FBI through the press in recent years. Please be prepared to forward the press release to your local media. We will let you know when we determine the exact date it will be filed. Please stay tuned.
NOTE: This case represents another opportunity to access the withheld FBI documents through discovery.
KEEP PUSHING CONGRESS FOR INVESTIGATIONS! Meanwhile, a window of opportunity continues to exist with the House Committee on Government Reform. As you know this committee is planning to investigate cases of FBI misconduct leading to wrongful convictions. We must press the Reform Committee to shine its spot light on Leonard's case. Please continue to write Representative Burton on a regular basis, and cc your letters to your representative. A recent phone call to Rep Burton's office indicates that he is collecting and taking notice of our letters. Please send us copies of any response letters you receive from officials so that we can track their LET US KNOW Let us know if you are organizing anything for Leonard whether it be for June 26 or any other date so that we can help by publicizing it. Do not hesitate to contact us to share your ideas and suggestions about building pressure and awareness for the freedom of Leonard Peltier!
Thank you.

Enron Succeeded in Aid Pursuit
Company Won $7 Billion in Pledges for Overseas Plans
By James V. Grimaldi
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, March 22, 2002; Page E01
Enron Corp.'s vast overseas energy investments were aided by promises of more than $7 billion in loans and insurance from the European, Asian and worldwide development banks, as well as key U.S. export-support agencies, according to a report to be released today.
It has previously been reported that the United States' two primary development banks provided more than $3 billion in backing for Enron projects. The report by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, said Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank agencies each agreed to provide about $750 million, and an array of other agencies overseas promised $2 billion in assistance to power projects from China to Nigeria in which Enron was a participant.
Compiled from media reports and agency annual reports, the study's totals include hundreds of millions of dollars in financing and insurance that were approved but never disbursed. The Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC), for example, did not disburse about $840 million of the $2.5 billion it promised in support of Enron projects.

March 21, Turkey: Two Are Left Dead In Clashes Between Kurds & Police
DIYARBAKIR: Thousands of Kurdish youths put up barricades and battled police in a southern Turkish city after authorities banned Kurds from celebrating their New Year. Two demonstrators were killed. Riot police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse crowds in the city of Mersin, where at least 40 police and 20 protesters were injured. At least 200 people were detained. Authorities banned celebrations of Nowruz _the Farsi-language word for "new year" - in Mersin and other southeast cities where they said the festivities would be "exploited by outlawed groups to cause provocations." Several thousand Kurds in Mersin hurled rocks and bricks at personnel carriers and authorities to protest the ban. Among the injured was small girl crushed by a huge metal garbage container accidentally knocked over by a personnel carrier. The girl appeared to be seriously injured and was rushed to hospital. A Kurdish man was killed by police in the clashes. Hours before the protests began, two policemen were killed in Mersin when an armored personnel carrier ran off a bridge while patrolling the streets. The clashes recalled those at Nowruz celebrations at the height of the 15-year-conflict between autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels and Turkish troops. Police regularly clashed then with Kurdish demonstrators who used the festival to assert demands for Kurdish rights. The conflict has left some 37,000 dead, though fighting has eased since the rebels declared a unilateral cease-fire in 1999. The ancient Persian festival - celebrated the first day of spring in countries including Afghanistan and Iran - is mainly a Kurdish event in Turkey. In Istanbul, where the festival was also banned, police used water cannons to disperse demonstrating Kurds. Police said more than 540 were detained. In Diyarbakir, the largest city in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast, hundreds of thousands of Kurds gathered in a field outside the city, arriving on foot or crammed in the back of trucks. The police presence was heavy and included tanks. However, no major troubles were reported. Turkey, which is seeking membership in the European Union, is under increasing pressure from human rights groups to grant cultural rights to Kurds. For more information on the Kurdish struggle for self-determination, we recommend that you read Noam Chomsky's excellent book American Interventionism.

British objections to the use of British-supplied weapons in Israel's latest military push against the Palestinians have focused new attention on the United States' reluctance to restrain Israel's use of the multi-billion-dollar, high-tech arms it sells to the Jewish state each year.
The US is embarrassed by the high profile given to some of its machinery in the occupied territories - particularly its F-16 fighter jets, in missile strikes against police stations and other public buildings, and its Apache attack helicopters, in Israel's controversial campaign to assassinate Palestinian militants.
But the Administration has refused to go public with its growing unease over the use of US weaponry, in what the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, now calls an "all-out conventional war" on Palestinian civilians.
But last week Britain revealed that in 2000 it had extracted a written assurance from Israel that no military equipment originating from Britain would be used in the occupied territories. The revelation was sparked when a British diplomat stationed in the Middle East recognised an Israeli armoured personnel carrier as a modified Centurion tank, which Britain had supplied to Israel up until 1970.
Now Britain is demanding an explanation from the Israelis. Last year an unnamed US State Department spokesman told The Independent in London that at some point Washington would have to make a call on whether the Israelis were in breach of a stipulation in the Arms Export Control Act that weapons sold could be used only for "legitimate self-defence" - but yesterday a department spokeswoman would not tell the Herald if the issue had advanced.
Israel is one of the biggest buyers of US arms, and much of the trade is financed with the $US2 billion a year it gets from Washington in military aid. Its arsenal includes dozens of US helicopters (AH 64As, AH 1Fs, AH 1Gs); hundreds of tanks (M-60s) and armoured personnel carriers; and the biggest fleet of American fighter aircraft outside the US (F-15s, F-16s, F-4s and A-4s).
A US-based lobby group, the Palestinian Monitor, says the US should act against Israel because of its "consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognised human rights" and, in particular, killings carried out by its airborne assassination squads.
However, the argument that the US was refusing to put pressure on Israel over its treatment of Palestinians was laughed at by one of the US's top authorities on the Israeli military, Anthony Cordesman, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
Told by the Herald about the assurance won from Israel by the British, he said: "Someone has to be joking. This kind of contract clause is a joke in the weapons trade. If you think you can tightly control weapons after you have sold them, then you're living in fantasy land ...
"People in this trade make a lot of promises for face-saving purposes. There are provisions in international law on not using weapons on civilians, but defining civilians in a low-level war like this one can be an academic exercise."
But on the ground, the Israeli choice of US weapons does make a difference. After the Israelis launched a US-built TOW missile in a helicopter attack on a Gaza police station last year, a staff member who survived confronted an American visitor. "This is what your country is doing," he said, holding up a part of the missile carrying the words "made in the USA".
He reportedly went on: "We hate the Israelis for this ... but we hate America more." FROM

The Waukesha Freeman's decision to kill a column by Mark Belling shows the difference between what you can say on talk radio and what you can get away with in print.
The WISN-AM (1130) talker's most recent weekly column dealt with the pedophile priest scandal rocking the Roman Catholic Church. He's dealt with the topic on the air, but his column was too much for The Freeman.
"We've given Mark Belling a broad editorial license, and we will continue to," Freeman publisher and editor Jeff Hovind says. "At the risk of being too analytical, I think Mark Belling is very angered at his church and sort of vented in his column in a very personal way."
The lead paragraph suggests the church take out ads in "porno magazines" reading, "If you like to molest little boys and wish to avoid the consequences, we're the place for you." He then lists a number for Archbishop Rembert Weakland "to apply."
Belling, a former altar boy, denies any assertion that he's anti-Catholic and doesn't understand Hovind's published explanation for not running the "They say that the column was too offensive to run, but in explaining why it was too offensive to run, they ran the whole offending paragraph," the talker says.
Belling admits that one of Hovind's criticisms was valid. He first had written, "anecdotal evidence indicates many priests (perhaps more than half) are gay." In the version of the column available on his Web site,  the parenthetical phrase is gone.
"That was not going to appear in the column," he says.
By the way, Hovind's formal explanation for not running Belling's column can be found at Belling's biggest objection is Hovind's public criticism of him. But he isn't crying censorship.
"They're a private company. They can run anything they want," he says. "I've always praised The Freeman for being willing to run voices that most newspapers wouldn't run. I have, until this week, been given virtually total freedom.
"This is more about the guy that's presently in charge than the Freeman. He appears to have hang-ups with the column."
However, Hovind says that the power of Belling's remarks are magnified on the printed page.
"When he read his column in the air, it obviously didn't have the same impact that it did in print," Hovind says. "On the page, the words aren't fleeting. The listeners aren't trying to hear his next point."
Both Belling and Hovind say the column will return to The Freeman next week.

MUERTE AL ESTADO Y VIVA LA ANARQUIA!!! The return of the Durutti Brigade
About 5.000 people participated in the red and black bloc in the
demonstration of 16th March, against the european summit. There were blac
bloc groups, libertarians, CNT, squatters, many anticapitalist and radical
activists, that marched together with red and black flags and anarchist
slogans. The direct action against symbols of the state and capital (two
police stations, dozens of banks, military palace and judicial palace,
offices of authoritative trade union), the confrontations with the police
who used rubber bullets, the attacks against their squads and vans,the
barricades and the presence of thousands of people refusing to run away and
keeping on shouting all together VIVA LA ANARQUIA, POLICIA ASESINA, in all
the difficult moments the police was charging, created a revolutionary
situation, an atmosphere of fiesta and revolt, of rage and revenge for the
repression in the 15th March anticapitalist demo and for all all the
repression, arrests and tortures of our comrades who faught all over the
world, from Seattle and Prague, to Gotemburg and Genoa. It was an extremly
inspiring experience to be among thousands of people marching together in
solidarity, despite the rubber bullets flying in the air and the
helicopters above our heads. During the riots, people from the bloc that
didn4t participa It is true that civil police made arrests inside the bloc,
and that was the purpose of them being there. Many civil police who were
recognized by demonstrators were beaten and chased away. There were also
confrontations with members of the "demonstration police" who stood in
front of banks and police and tried to prevent comrades violently. In
Barcelona it was shown once more that the struggle against global
dictatorship of state and capital is not retreating by repression, it is
not sold to the reformists and to social pacification in front of the
continuous crimes of global domination. The struggle continues, confronting
the forces of the state, uncontrolled from the manipulation of those who
believe in old and new models of authority, parliaments and NGO4s, stating
that the only limit is a world without states and borders, without
exploitation and oppression. We carry a new world in our hearts, and we
make it alive through our efforts to destroy the existing hierarchical and
repressive status. We make it alive the moments we fight back, the moments
we stand together against repression, the moments that we share the
struggle for freedom with all the damned and oppressed people, all the
comrades in revolt. From the streets of Genoa to Argentina, from the

Red Brigades return to Italy
By Natasha Bita
March 23, 2002
A STAR scratched into the peeling paintwork of a Bologna door signalled the resurgence of political terrorism in Italy this week.
The crude calling-card of the Red Brigades, the extreme-left terrorists who assassinated hundreds of politicians, judges, journalists and police officers in the 1970s and '80s, marks the spot where an Italian government adviser was gunned down outside his apartment on Tuesday.
A group calling itself the Red Brigades for the Construction of the Fighting Communists emailed a 26-page diatribe to police yesterday claiming responsibility for the execution of Marco Biagi, an economist who drew up divisive labour-market reforms being pushed by the conservative Berlusconi Ballistics experts concluded that Biagi  a close friend of European Commission president and former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi  was shot with the same pistol used to assassinate Massimo D'Antona, an adviser to Italy's former left-wing government, three years ago.
Newspapers harked back to the giorni di piombo, or "days of lead" when left and right-wing extremists waged war with kidnappings, assassinations and The Corriere della Sera newspaper announced "the return of terrorism" and published a photo gallery of the victims of "30 years of bloodshed", noting that 420 people had died and 1200 had been injured in terror attacks since Of the 360 fatal attacks, 280 were attributed to the extreme left, 27 to neo-fascists and 26 to international terrorists. The Red Brigades took responsibility for the 1978 kidnapping and murder of former prime minister Aldo Moro. In 1980 a bomb killed 85 at the Bologna train station, although the culprits were never found.
The Red Brigades, a Marxist-Leninist group that grew from the student protests of the 1960s, went underground after most of its leaders were arrested in France and Italy in the 1980s.
The group splintered into the Communist Combatant Party and the Union of Combatant Communists in 1984.
But 18 years later, chronic unemployment, disillusionment with mainstream politics and a backlash against globalisation are providing fodder for new terrorist groups, such as the "Black Bloc" anarchists who hijacked protests at the G8 meeting in Genoa last year.
Italy's secret service, in its six-monthly report to parliament last week, warned of terrorist attacks in response to government policies such as the proposal to make it easier for companies to sack workers.
The report warned potential targets were politicians, unionists or business figures "who are most committed to economic, social and labour reforms, especially those who play a crucial role as experts or consultants".
Biagi, who was shot dead as he arrived home on his bicycle, had complained to police about death threats and requested an armed escort.
Ironically, his bodyguards were removed after the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre because the Government wanted to put more secret service agents on the streets.
Italian politicians are the most heavily guarded in Europe, with 6000 bodyguards at a cost of $1 billion a year.
Biagi's widow, angry that the Government had refused her family's request for protection, spurned the offer of a state funeral in favour of a private family service in Bologna today.
Up to 80,000 people marched in Bologna on Wednesday to mourn Biagi's death and protest against terrorism.
Unions planning a rally of 1 million workers in Rome this weekend to oppose the Government's labour reforms said they would dedicate the march to anti-terrorism and democracy instead.
The Pope yesterday appealed for "a climate of understanding between the social factions in this dear Italian nation", but the assassination only fuelled the bickering among politicians, union and business leaders.
The leader of the right-wing Northern League, Umberto Bossi, declared that "the Left has lost its mind".
The peak industry lobby group Confindustria echoed his sentiments. "Every time this country has to make an important reform, the men who push ahead with the reforms are struck by terrorism and this is a price that we cannot continue to pay," said its president, Antonio D'Amato.
The Minister for Productive Works, Antonio Marzano, warned that "revenge for the murder of Marco Biagi by the Red Brigades is something which may He described the terrorists as "like bombs which are set off when you try to make reform, because they fear the new and want Italy to remain silenced".
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi insisted his Government would not back down on labour reforms because "we cannot let terrorism force our hand". But the unions refused to budge on the same grounds, insisting they would go ahead with a general strike next month.
Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi urged Italians to have faith in their democracy.
"The horror and anguish over the barbaric assassination of Marco Biagi cannot and must not weaken confidence in the force of democracy," he said.
"Italians are united against terrorism."

The Fair Go For David Website has been set up in response to concerns from a growing number of Australians and other citizens from around the world. David is David Hicks, alleged Taliban member.
In December 2001 David, an Australian, was captured in Afghanistan which was being bombed by the Americans during George W. Bush's war on terror.
Five concerned people, including one American, met in February, 2002, and decided to investigate exactly what they could about David's case. At that stage David had been sent to Cuba by the US forces.
One of the reasons these people met was because one had been informed by an acquaintance of the Hicks' family that ASIO (Australian Security and intelligence Organisation) and Commonwealth Police had, on several occasions, visited the family home. Representatives from these organisations had taken Terry Hicks' computer

Hicks being 'presumed guilty'
March 21, 2002
AUSTRALIAN-born Taliban fighter David Hicks was being presumed guilty and his rights ignored by the American and Australian governments, his lawyer Adelaide-based lawyer Stephen Kenny today said it was doubtful whether Hicks could ever receive a fair trial.
Mr Kenny said the American and Australian governments were ignoring requests for information about Hicks, 26, who has been detained at a US military compound at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
"It appears to us that the Australian government is showing very little interest in having him repatriated," Mr Kenny told reporters today.
"He has been in Guantanamo Bay in a cage for 68 days - how long does it take them to make up their mind?"
Mr Kenny said his repeated letters to the Australian government about Hicks had not been answered.
"The Australian government appears quite simply to be ignoring our requests ... it appears the attorney-general is ignoring my requests," he said.
Mr Kenny said even if Prime Minister John Howard wanted Hicks to face trial here, the fate of the Adelaide-born Taliban fighter would be decided by "It is my belief that John Howard is not well regarded or well listened to in Washington, it appears that on many issues he is simply ignored," he said.
"It's unlikely they will take much notice of John Howard."
Mr Kenny also criticised US President George W Bush for comments made about the Guantanamo Bay detainees.
Mr Bush was quoted yesterday by Reuters as saying: "Remember, the ones in Guantanamo Bay are killers. They don't share the same values we share."
Mr Kenny said the comments were most concerning because if Hicks faced a US military tribunal, Mr Bush could ultimately decide the Australian's fate.
"We are extremely concerned about the president having the final say because it makes the findings of the military tribunal essentially irrelevant," he said.
"Even if they (the tribunal) found David Hicks innocent, President Bush may impose his own final decision.
"And given that he has already made comments along the lines of `remember they are killers' suggests that he has prejudged the issue."
Mr Kenny said he had "serious concerns about his (Hicks') ability to get a fair trial, even in Australia, considering the comments that have been made by various government ministers".
Mr Kenny said America changed the status of its detention of Hicks from a military order to "pursuant to the president's authority as commander in chief and under the laws and usages of war".
"It is simply one more step along what appears to be a road of indefinite detention," he said.
"It is no crime to be a soldier and that's what he was - he was a soldier in the Taliban army and, as far as I understand, under Australian law that is no crime."

Sue Ellison, analyst tells Oracle users
By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco
Posted: 20/03/2002 at 23:39 GMT
Meta Group analyst Mark Shainman says Oracle users should take legal action to block the database giant from renegotiating some license fees.
Meta says customers who aggregate feeds to and from data warehouses on Oracle databases are now being asked to pay more. The issue arises, according to Meta, because batch jobs to the database are now being considered by Oracle as several, rather than one request. Oracle supports multiplexing, or pooling data through a proxy, from several sources into one request. Oracle now wants to regard this as many requests, rather than one request.
Shainman says this could result in a fivefold increase for some users. He says users should go to court to defend existing license arrangements.
Oracle says it's being entirely consistent, and characterizes the Meta bulletin as a "misunderstanding".
Readers with first hand experience of the new multiplexing license arrangement should get in touch. We'd like to hear from you. .

With the rapid catch-up of 'politics' to the tech explosion,there are expanding opportunities to align the technical with the social revolution.Are we not punks?
Even the ramping up of state repression,homeland security,neighborhood watch,witchhunts,etc can work in our favour.The arms race of spy vs security has taken on exponential features as other features online stabilize.The exponential increase of people online internationally,also continues.The State now tacitly accepts that 'the rats out of the bag,"and managing perceptions is the last best hope to stave off disaster,(for them and their crony capitalist friends.)That task is getting beyond them also as peoples media explodes exponentialy.

BLINDED BY THE RIGHT
The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative
By David Brock
Crown. 336 pp. $25.95
Say what you want about David Brock, but he sure knows his clothes. In his new memoir, Blinded by the Right, the now flagrantly repentant right-wing attack dog recalls that when he first worked at the Washington Times, his "impeccably tailored" boss, Arnaud de Borchgrave, complimented his "pale-blue spread-collar shirt" from Neiman-Marcus with these words: "Young man, who is your shirtmaker?" One Republican mover and shaker, Brock reveals, wore a "navy blue suit and Hermhs tie," while John Fund of the Wall Street Journal went around in "brown double-knit suits" and Matt Drudge "often was clad in an ill-fitting seersucker suit and straw fedora." More up Brock's line, obviously, were the ensembles favored by R. Emmett Tyrrell, his editor at the American Spectator, whose taste ran to "Savile Row suits and Turnbull & Asser shirts and ties." Comments Brock: "I found myself wanting the material comforts he had."
It didn't take long before he got them. His bestselling 1993 book, The Real Anita Hill, and his American Spectator Troopergate stories, which led to the Lewinsky scandals, made the young journalist not only a movement hero but also a rich man. (Friends called his D.C. townhouse "the house that Anita Hill built.") So valuable was he to his conservative allies that when threats of outing forced him to acknowledge his homosexuality, even the most abhorrent gay-bashers among them kept inviting him to parties. (Lucky His biggest triumph of all was the million-dollar advance he got for The Seduction of Hillary Rodham. Yet he couldn't bring himself to write the vicious slam his editors expected. He looked for dirt, he says, but found little. What's more, he liked the lady: "In finding Hillary Clinton's humanity, I was beginning to find my own." When the book appeared in 1996, the right turned on him. Party invitations dried up. The next year, he got a splashy Esquire article, "Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man," out of his fall from grace; later, the same magazine ran an "open letter" in which he apologized to Clinton for Troopergate. (Clinton accepted.)
Now, in Blinded by the Right, Brock goes whole hog, retracting pretty much the entire oeuvre on which he made his rep. He admits he knowingly printed lies. He apologizes to Anita Hill. And he claims that deep down he was, all along, not a conservative but a classical liberal.
Why, then, did he ever become a "right-wing hit man" -- and remain one even after the fall of Soviet communism, when the right turned its ire on gays? He offers many explanations. In attacking the left, he was only expressing his own gay self-hatred. He was courting his reactionary father's -- and colleagues' -- approval. ("The sad reality," he tells us, "is that I was trying to fill my unmet, private emotional needs through my professional life.") Also, his parents had raised him to be an unreflective camp follower -- and besides, he "didn't have the ability, or temperament, or patience" to write intellectual-type essays "for highbrow publications like Commentary." And then, of course, there were those Savile Row suits.
And oh, the parties! He still seems to cherish the memory of those fabulous movement soiries, about which he quotes himself being quoted in National Review: "Losers don't have good parties. Part of what energizes the Washington social scene is being in power."
Now, however, he's eager to pillory himself. The old David Brock, he asserts, was "a mad dog, an emotional monster," "a whore for the cash," "unbalanced," "a Jew in Hitler's army," "a witting cog in the Republican sleaze machine." "I didn't know," he acknowledges, "what good reporting was." He quotes the worst things critics said about him, and agrees with every word. In a strange way, it's both too much and, somehow, not enough.
He insists he's learned compassion. Yet alternating with these hyperbolic mea culpas are reams of familiar-sounding trash talk. Notorious for calling Anita Hill "a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty," Brock now serves up equally tacky putdowns of dozens of ex-friends, including "right-wing fag hags" Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Arianna Huffington. Berating himelf for having smeared liberals with ideologically irrelevant gossip, some of it secondhand and unconfirmed, he now does exactly the same thing to conservatives. (For good measure, he also disses one left-winger, Christopher Hitchens, whom he describes, none too charitably, as "misshapen, unkempt, and seemingly unshowered.") It's neither a pretty nor a dignified performance.
Brock says he's traded "party-line polemics" for "independent thinking." Yet at the same time he purports to have reclaimed his boyhood hero-worship of RFK (he refers, without a hint of irony, to "the brimming idealism of the Kennedy clan"). Can it be that he's put "all those Bobs -- Bork, Tyrrell, Dornan, Bartley, Barr" behind him only to embrace the legend of Bobby?
And if he has, is he sincere about it? "I lost my soul," he laments; now, he maintains, he's found his conscience. One thing's for sure: he's found a new -- and well-dressed -- social circle. Toward book's end, born-again Brock attends "the annual black-tie dinner" of a gay-rights lobbying group, where he basks in the glow of "a graceful poem by Maya Angelou, and a heartfelt speech by Vice President Al Gore." Remembering that exactly four years earlier he'd been at a Christian Coalition conference, he declares that he feels "happy, finally, to be in the right place, both morally and Yet given Brock's unsavory record, his continued below-the-belt attacks and his obvious talent for turning contrition into a career move, it's fair to ask: Where is he really, morally and emotionally? We know where he is geographically: He's still living in "the house that Anita Hill built." His professions of remorse may well be sincere; I'll believe them for sure the day he hands Ms. Hill the keys to the house. 

Microsoft 'killed Dell Linux' - States
By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco
Posted: 19/03/2002 at 09:33 GMT
Microsoft sharpshooter Joachim Kempin, who was convicted of illegally shooting antelope in Montana in 1998, has been turning his guns on a more familiar target: Microsoft's own OEM customers.
The States' remedy hearing opened in DC yesterday, and States attorney Steven Kuney produced a devastating memo from Kempin, then in charge of Microsoft's OEM business, written after Judge Jackson had ordered his break-up of the company. Kempin raises the possibility of threatening Dell and other PC builders which promote Linux.
"I'm thinking of hitting the OEMs harder than in the past with anti-Linux. ... they should do a delicate dance," Kempin wrote to Ballmer, in what is sure to be a memorable addition to the phrases ("knife the baby", "cut off the air supply") with which Microsoft enriched the English language in the first trial. Unlike those two, this is not contested.
The bullets aimed Spaghetti Western-style at the feet of the dancing OEMs translate to Microsoft withholding source code, according to the memo.
For these details we're indebted to eWeek's Darryl Taft, who unlike some his fellow reporters, appeared to stay for the afternoon session of the hearing. His account of the day's proceedings can be found here, and includes the delicious detail that late in the afternoon, Sun Microsystems was desperately trying to close the session, arguing that cross examination would reveal confidential information submitted under seal.
Reuters also mentions the Linux threat in passing, but compare and contrast with The New York Times, which doesn't. CNET and Wired simply carry the Reuters report.
Earlier memos described that it was "untenable" that a key Microsoft partner was promoting Linux. Kuney revealed that Dell disbanded its Linux business unit in early 2001. Dell quietly pulled Linux from its desktop PCs in the summer of 2001, IDG's Ashlee Vance discovered subsequently, six months after we heard Michael Dell declare his love of Linux on the desktop the previous winter.
Compaq was also mentioned in other memos, with Microsoft taking the line that OEMs should "meet demand but not help create demand" for Linux.
Kempin was Microsoft's chief OEM enforcer in the second half of the nineties, contributing a string of memorable memos to the 1998 Trial, and takes the credit for ensuring that the price of a Windows rose as the price of PCs were falling, during this period.
"The plaintiffs are not here to punish Microsoft - the plaintiffs' goals are to make Microsoft behave properly," argued a States' attorney. But how? Short of obliging the executives to wear antelope horns and race in front of an SUV under a hail of rifle fire, it's hard to see what language they understand. .

FROM Window v. Lindows - round one to underdog
By Drew Cullen
Posted: 19/03/2002 at 13:28 GMT
Lindows.com has won the first round in its legal trademark battle against A Seattle court last week denied Microsoft's motion to stop Lindows.com from using this name for its company and LindowsOS for its new operating system. Worse, for Microsoft, the company may have shot itself in the foot by launching the action in the first place.
In his ruling Judge John C. Coughenour said: "Microsoft has raised serious questions about the validity of its trademark [Windows]."
This may deter Microsoft from further action - any appeal and it could risk having Windows explicitly stripped as a trademark. We shall see.
In the meantime Lindows.com is victorious, and it looks increasingly like our initial assessment of its chances of success were wrong. .

SACRAMENTO: Authorities have recovered a fourth body believed dumped by the mob in a deep lake.
Two bodies were pulled on Sunday from beneath a bridge in New Melones Lake, a reservoir in the Sierra Nevada foothills. A third was found under a second bridge over the lake on Monday, and a fourth - apparently a woman - was pulled from the lake yesterday.
All four were recovered by a remotely operated submersible vehicle and brought to the surface by divers.
FBI spokesman Nick Rossi said more bodies could be submerged in the water more than 60 metres deep.
Rossi would not comment on the victims' cause of death. He said the investigation began in another FBI office, but gave no further details.
The FBI also is investigating whether the body of a man found floating in the lake on October 18 with his hands bound and a plastic bag over his head was a victim of an organised crime hit, Rossi said.
The victim was identified yesterday as Tim May, a Corralitos retiree. The cause of death was strangulation, according to a death certificate.Nic Rossi just called to say he has resigned and changed his name fearing an APster outbreak.

Sacked Chinese murder their bosses
 From Oliver August in Xiannin.
WORKERS in Chinas industrial heartland have started killing their bosses in protest at mass redundancies.
In three recent, gruesome cases, managers at neighbouring state-owned factories were murdered in disputes with their employees.
Sources say that labour-related killings have become widespread as reform programmes try to shift millions of workers into the private sector. Among the worst affected areas is Hubei province in central China, once the cradle of Maoist heavy industry but now weighed down with thousands of dead-end factories.
In Xianning, a town 100 miles south of the Yangtse River, unemployed workers play cards at a decrepit chemical fibre factory while discussing its impending bankruptcy. They seem to accept the murder of their boss by Xu Yudong, a sacked colleague, as an almost normal by-product of Government Many of Xiannings residents share the frustrations of Xu, a 28-year-old worker who was laid off last October. The manager of the fibre plant, Wang Shihua, offered him a redundancy package worth  after eight years of employment. Xu is said to have protested: The severance pay is too little. Its not even enough to start a small business. What am I going to do when I get old? The manager agreed to increase the package to  but Xu was still dissatisfied. When he began work at the plant in 1993, the Communist Party was promising lifetime employment. Now, the Communists wanted to throw him out with little hope of a new job.
Xu returned to Mr Wangs office on October 31 to negotiate again but this time he was armed with a fruit knife. Mr Wang rejected his renewed demands and an enraged Xu pulled out his knife and stabbed him in the lower abdomen. Mr Wang died in hospital the same day. Xu was sentenced to death three weeks later and executed in January.
In the street outside the factory, grimy children play a game called Kill the Boss in which they re-enact the managers death, pretending to stab and throttle each other.
A worker called Xiang said that people had become used to eating from the iron rice bowl, the Chinese expression for a state-allocated job, guaranteed for life. They dont know anything else, so when thats taken away all of a sudden, they dont know what to do with themselves, he said.
Mr Wangs murder is one of three at Hubeis state-owned enterprises in less than six months. In Huanggang, two hours drive north of Xianning, the 19-year-old son of a man laid off from Huanggang Aluminium Group killed the general manager who had sacked 10 per cent of the workforce.
Even the Xinhua state news agency, which usually plays down such incidents, reported that the son was enraged at his fathers redundancy and by the wealth of the general manager, an allusion to corrupt practices.
The agency also reported the killing of the deputy manager of a subsidiary of Xiangfan Xiangyang Resources as he was closing the insolvent company. He, too, was the victim of a sacked worker.
Beijing has admitted that unemployment is one of its biggest problems. Although the official total is seven million, the real figure may be more than 100 million.
How do you like them apples petrie? Justice is coming for you.

@_subject: Anarchist Q+A Would cities exist in an anarchist society? 
ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER Q. Would cities exist in an anarchist society? A. Some people believe that anarchism is such a simple philosophy, that anarchists are incapable of living in a highly complex post industrial society. The utopian vision of life in an anarchist world revolves around the creation of self-sufficient, self-rural villages. Unfortunately the reality of feeding and housing a population of over six billion people, makes a mockery of this utopian vision. Cities would continue to exist in an anarchist society, what would change would be the way these cities are organised and how they function. A greater deal of time and energy would go into making cities self-sufficient and sustainable. Energy sources would change from highly centralised sources to decentralised sources that are sustainable. At the end of the day, whoever controls energy production in a community controls that community. Relying on centralised energy production creates the conditions for the re-imposition of authoritarian controls over a community. Local government and local participation would play a much greater role in an anarchist city, each street would develop a mechanism by which people meet and make decisions about how they interact and live. Shopping centres would give way to distribution centres, possibly the range and variety of goods that are produced would decrease, because production revolves around the need to meet human need, not to create a profit for profits sake. Information and recreation centres would become the hub of city life. Information exchange about what work needs to be done, what rosters need to be organised, accommodation available and decisions to be reviewed, would be a critical feature of life in a city. People would become active participants because without their active participation, things would grind to a halt. The problem isn9t cities per say, the problem is how cities are organised, how they meet people9s needs and whether they can become sustainable entities. To deny that cities will play a role in a future anarchist society, is to deny the reality of human history.

IT9S NOT OVER TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS All those Western political commentators who stated that September the 11th marked the end of anti-globalisation protests have egg on their faces. On the weekend over 500,000 protestors demonstrated against the European Union meeting in Barcelona that has opened Europe9s borders to trans-national corporations. The anti-globalisation movement is not dead and buried, it9s alive and well and is regrouping across the world. The September the 11th attacks were conducted by people who are a mirror image of the United States government. They were conducted by a rigid, hierarchical religious movement that has more in common with George W. Bush9s government, than the anti-globalisation movement. The movement against the global expansion of trans-national interests is a movement that has nothing in common with religious fundamentalists who are trying to impose their view of the world on everybody within their sphere of influence. The anti-globalisation struggle, is a struggle that allows local communities to develop their own future. It9s a movement that wants to see the free movement of people, the breakdown of national borders and the regulation of trans-national corporations. The so called free trade lobby is a lobby that is willing to ride roughshod over local interests in the pursuit of global profits. Their responsibility lies primarily to their major shareholders, not to the people. Free trade is all about breaking down local and national boundaries to maximise trans-national corporate profits. It has nothing to do with the free exchange of goods. Free trade is a euphemism for corporate domination of local interests. That9s why the anti-globalisation movement is set to grow. Its strength lies in its ability to foster local autonomy over global control. That9s why Seattle, Washington, Melbourne, Geona, Prague and now Barcelona are not aberrations that will disappear from the political and social scene.

89 Charged in Online Child Porn Network
  Crime: The FBI, in its most aggressive crackdown yet, says 20-state ring swapped images through Yahoo.

89 Charged in Online Child Porn Network.
By P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and KAREN KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS
Marking the most aggressive and widespread government crackdown over online obscenity, federal investigators on Monday charged more than 89 people--including Little League coaches, eight clergy members, a school bus driver and at least one police officer--with belonging to a 20-state child pornography ring that met and swapped explicit images through Yahoo Inc.
The FBI said it had arrested 19 people in recent days, bringing the total to 40 in the last 14 months as part of its "Operation Candyman." At least 50 more arrests are expected this week.
The arrests come amid a stepped-up attack on child exploitation by the Department of Justice and state officials eager to crack down on Internet pornography. Beginning next month, a Pennsylvania law will hold Internet service providers criminally liable if the companies do not block any site that the state attorney general's office deems to offer child pornography.
'A New Marketplace . . . Has Emerged'
Authorities say their goal is to close off a growing maze of Internet back alleys they say have made children more susceptible than ever to sexual "It is clear that a new marketplace for child pornography has emerged in the dark corners of cyberspace," Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said at a news conference at FBI headquarters. "Hidden in the vastness of the Internet, innocent boys and girls have been targeted by offenders who view them as sexual objects. These offenders have tried to use technology and anonymity of the Internet to trade child pornography, and these individuals must be Civil libertarians and the high-tech industry worry that such a crackdown could be taken too far, and note that even the federal definition of "child pornography" is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Federal law makes it a crime to sell or possess "any visual depiction" that seems to show a sex act--simulated or real--involving an actor who appears to be a minor. Congress later expanded the definition to include even "computer-generated images," such as cartoons and video games, that portray minors in apparent sexual positions.
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor expressed skepticism during a hearing last year. She questioned whether the Oscar-winning film "Traffic" could fall under the law's broad definition of illegal pornography. One scene portrays the underage daughter of an official in the war on drugs apparently having sex with a drug dealer.
"The language is extremely open to interpretation," said attorney H. Louis Sirkin, who represents the Free Speech Coalition, a collection of adult-film makers that is challenging the federal statute in the Supreme Court. "Is it child pornography when there's no real child involved?"
The computer files targeted in "Operation Candyman" involved images that are "very explicit . . . hard-core sexual exploitation of our children," said Michael Heimbach of the FBI's Crimes Against Children unit. FBI officials declined to say if the material swapped and sought in three Yahoo discussion groups contained photos, videos, animation or any files with audio.
Like music fans with Napster, tens of millions of Internet users have transformed the club and community sections of Yahoo's "EGroup" networks into havens for swapping hard-core images.
"We applaud the efforts of the Department of Justice and the FBI in apprehending individuals who engage in the creation and online distribution of illegal content," said Yahoo spokeswoman Mary Osako.
Group Claimed About 4,600 U.S. Members
Yahoo officials have acknowledged that their members have created virtual red-light districts, just as others have built virtual communities focused on snowboarding and needlepoint.
One of the Yahoo groups depicted itself this way: "This group is for People who love kids. You can post any type of messages you like too or any type of pics and vids you like too." One of the groups was dubbed "Candyman," and the other two have not been identified because investigators still are tracing suspects through their e-mail addresses.
The "Candyman" group claimed more than 7,000 members, including about 4,600 in the United States, the FBI said. It's not clear if each of those members is a unique individual, or if there are cases of one person having multiple The FBI did not disclose a full list of the people charged in this case or if any of the suspects come from Southern California, which is considered the capital of the commercial adult-film industry.
Identifying, charging and arresting the thousands of people affected by Monday's action could take several months. The FBI hasn't decided whether to pursue the roughly 2,400 group members in other countries, the official Those charged so far include a foster parent, two Catholic priests, and medical, educational, military and law enforcement professionals, according to the FBI.
One of the suspects is Father Thomas A. Rydzewski, an associate pastor at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore. Arrested on Dec. 13, he was charged with possession of child pornography. Rydzewski told the FBI that he "has long had a curiosity" about child pornography and that he sometimes connected to Internet newsgroups that promote it.
In Las Vegas, the FBI arrested Beckham Baker, a 23-year-old teacher's aide at a day-care facility, Special Agent Gayle Jacobs said. Baker was arrested Feb. 7 on one count of possessing child pornography and one count of receiving it. He was arrested six weeks ago because he works with children and is considered more of a threat, though he is free on bail, Jacobs said.
The FBI said Monday that 27 of the people arrested in conjunction with "Operation Candyman" have admitted to molesting more than 36 children.
Since 1995, a Boston-based FBI task force dubbed "Innocent Images" has been focused on proliferation of child pornography and other harmful and exploitative material on the Internet. FBI investigators in Houston joined the task force and initiated the investigation into the Candyman Internet group early last year. The investigation quickly expanded to include two other Yahoo EGroups. It's not clear whether all 89 people charged Monday were members of the Candyman group.
States Follow Federal Government's Lead
Monday's news follows last year's "Operation Avalanche," in which about 100 people were arrested by the FBI in a two-year undercover sting. U.S. officials later forwarded the names of 9,000 Web subscribers to local authorities because of the users' "predilection" for child pornography.
"We will diligently shut down any and all Web sites, EGroups, bulletin boards and any other mediums that will foster the continued exploitation of our children," said FBI Director Robert Mueller.
Some states are following the federal cue. Pennsylvania's law requires hundreds of Internet service providers such as America Online and EarthLink to remove or disable access to child pornography within five days of being notified by the state attorney general.
Surprisingly, the ACLU's Pennsylvania chapter praised the bill, noting that an Internet user whose access is cut off could seek redress in court.
But technology executives countered that tracking such sites can be a herculean task on the anonymous, global network.
"This is technically impossible for us to do," said Sue Ashdown, director of the American Internet Service Provider Assn., an organization of small ISPs.
Officials with AOL said they have scheduled meetings with the Pennsylvania attorney general's office to discuss the law, said company spokesman Nicholas Graham.
Times staff writer Aaron Zitner in Washington and Associated Press contributed to this report.

Three Bills have been introduced into Federal Parliament that will amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 in such a way as to cause major political and social concern to all Australians. The Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, The Espionage and Related Offences Act 2002 and the suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002, have been introduced under the guise of combating terrorism. Each Bill has profound implications for individuals and organisations in this country. The Security Legislation Amendment Bill, defines a terrorist act "as a specified action or threat of action that is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause". Although "Lawful advocacy protest and dissent and industrial action are expressly excluded from the ambit of the definition", the rapidly shrinking common law space surrounding protest and industrial action, clearly draws legitimate political and workplace action within the definition of the terrorist act. The Bill does not draw a distinction between a threat of action and the action itself and condemns both categories of offenders to prison terms, ranging from 25 years, to life imprisonment. The proposed laws turns established legal principles on their heads "It Is therefore not necessary to prove fault in relation to the terrorist connection. If it exists, in fact the person is liable". The most dangerous aspect of this Bill, is the power that the Attorney General holds over any organisation that exists in this country. An organisation can be banned by the Attorney General "regardless of whether the organisation has been charged or convicted of an offence" and an organisation can be banned "regardless of whether the member has been charged or convicted of an offense". This proposed change gives the Federal Attorney General powers that a dictator would be proud of. The Espionage and Related Offences Act 2002, turns Australia9s six intelligence agencies from spying, into policing agencies. It gives them the power to detain, interrogate and imprison anybody they like, on almost a personal whim. The Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002, gives the State the power to strip individuals and organisations of their assets on the flimsiest of grounds. Those people who say that this legislation, would only be used in the most extreme cases, only has to look at how ASIO was asked to monitor the electronic communications in Laurie Brereton9s parliamentary office and the illegal monitoring of calls surrounding the Tampa fiasco, to realise that these laws will be used to curtail legitimate domestic political activity. The only good thing about these Bills, is that there is still a slim chance they can be blocked in the Senate. The Labor Party needs to be shamed into blocking the three bills in the Senate. If the Labor Party parliamentary caucus allows these bills to pass through the Senate, it needs to understand that the trickle of true believers that have deserted the party will turn into a hemorrhage that will destroy it as a political force in this country.

@_subject: We are everywhere...even Dusseldorf. 
This is a second paper written for a working group for a conference in Duesseldorf, Germany. Anti Globalisation, World Wide Class Struggle In the last two years (since Seattle) the left, in Europe as elsewhere, have been successful in a few noteworthy mobilisations, that would not have been thought possible before. The high point was surely forcing the closure of the IMF / WB Summit in Prague, where 11,000 cops didn't get there to stop us form attacking the summit. However at the end of the day, such successful actions are just symbolic attacks. The premature ending of such a summit hinders the daily functioning of Capitalism, however not the Capital valorisation process. A movement that really wants to place the capitalist system in question, has to leave the symbolic plane, and attack the capitalist relations in the everyday life of exploitation and need. It is clear that this can't be done on a big scale, with what is understood as the 'anti-globalisation movement'. Up till now, after the militant Anti-globalisation demos, we return obediently to our every everyday lives where we work and pay for everything. A movement can however begin to attack the foundations of the power, if it places precisely this everyday exploitation in question - i.e.: if we, as the working class, who reproduce this system daily, get into movement. Where we keep the machines running through our daily work, we could also bring them to a stand still. That has only got the prospect of long term success if such struggles take place on an international level, relating to each other. This perspective can often appears to us here in Germany to be very unrealistic, because with us the ruling class seems to be so firmly in the saddle as nowhere else. So it may not be noticed, that capitalism is in a global crisis, that compels the world working class to fight. In different corners of the world the struggle is breaking out, whereby the usual mechanisms spring into action, to channel, integrate and render harmless the protests. It is not only in other countries, but also here with us that struggles take place, and they have a certain tendency, to become more similar to each other. In order to show this, we want to introduce in this working group, examples of different class struggles world wide: For example in Argentina: The land know as the model land of Neo-liberalism and complies with the conditions of the IMF, with brutal austerity measures at the cost of the people. For years there have been uprisings and occupied factories in different parts of the country. A movement of the unemployed began to get organised and block the major roads with burning barricades. There was little focus - until the rage exploded on the 19 and 20 December in a common peoples uprising, which overturned the government. In the next two weeks, five presidents took the role and immediately resigned in fast succession. The old apparatus of parties and unions had nothing to say. The people organised themselves, in the streets, in workplaces, in groups in their city neighbourhoods. For example in Paris: At the end of October 2001 the longest strike in a fast food company began in the McDonalds branch in Paris, it ended after 115 days, with success: The sacked people, who were the trigger point for the strike, came back to work after a court judgement, on top of that they got the back-pay for when they were on strike and negotiations over wage increases for the 800 McDonalds branches in France are under way. The strike had wide support. There were demonstrations every Saturday in front of the McDonalds branches. Other fast-food outlets in France have also got to striking point, and employees have started to organise themselves across different companies. McDonalds will no longer be the exhausted symbol of the `American way of life`, but as exploiter and the sharp end of the precarianisation of the work relations. (See the leaflet that was distributed in German McDonalds on:  For example Brighton: After the privatisation of the bin men, the workers refused to implement the increased work standards. They were sacked and occupied the factory in June 2001. Together with supporters they prevented the trucks with scabs, from driving out through the picket lines. A successful action: the contract with the private firm was terminated, the sacked workers were taken on again, the wages for the time of the occupation were paid and the pre-privatisation work standards were re-introduced. (See report in Wildcat-Zirkular Nr 59/60, Summer 2001,  For example Cologne: in front of an office block, in November 2001 twenty Turkish men and women danced in the rain to the rhythm of drums and flutes. "An end to the exploitation" read the banners. The target of the demo was a call centre running an 'ethno-marketing' business: Turkish speaking workers selling telecom products to Turkish speaking customers. When the workers tried to set up a works council (similar to a union) the company reacted with dismissals. The remaining colleagues did not venture out onto the street too, but must have been pleased with the loud and strong demonstration. Support from the German side was unfortunately not forthcoming. For example. In the working group we want examine the question of how we can keep up with such struggles, what they have to do with us and how we can relate to them.

THE TX ABC MEETING: NOTES
MARCH 8th and 9th '02
Attending: Houston ABC, Dallas/Ft. Worth ABC, Austin ABC,and folks from San
Antonio that were interested in started an ABC. FYI: Some of the groups
were new to ABC work so this was also an educational event as well as a
goal to solidifying TX ABC's. And these are simply our notes, most, if not
all, agendas were discussed in much more depth.
The 8th: On Friday night we had all collective members show up the night
before for so that each person could get to know one another, for those who
already didn't. This worked out well; we discussed politics and general
movement issues such as goals and ideas. But, overall it was simply a
socializing event.
The 9th: First we started out at with small introductions, why we were in
attendance and what we hope to see come of this meeting.
- What is the ABC: general run down of what the ABC was formed for, and the
measures it took to fit the needs of the prisoners. Needing to find a median
between the origins of the ABC and what we're doing today.
- Political Prisoner: anyone imprisoned for a political act.
- Social Prisoner: person whose become politicized after incarceration.
- Drug War Prisoner: a victim of high sentence because of the unjust war on
- Fight Back Prisoner: term for prisoners who fight back against violence
and repression (including spousal abuse).
- Class War Prisoner: someone imprisoned for fighting poverty.
(all of the above- becoming cohesive with the Network)
- Collectives and Autonomy (specialties): Austin ABC- organizing, visits,
publication distribution, printing, contacts, communications and
correspondence. Houston ABC- correspondence, publishing newsletter and
publication distribution. San Antonio- corporate info, political sway, money
(churches), defense committee and outreach. Dallas/Ft. Worth- correspondence
and benefit shows.
- Monies: help for National Conference. Keeping money autonomous. Being able
to send monthly stipends to prisoners. Set up a program where different
collectives take care of a certain number of checks.
- Delegating Distribution: Chain Reaction and Captive Voices- have one
collective do copies, one to do the actual distribution and work on being
efficient and not wasting resources. Austin will work on getting collectives
with a 501C3 status (non-profit status) to help with postage, and go to
places to sell CR and CV.
- Closed Collective idea: because we need folks to be accountable for
someone else's life we chose not to make our collectives open, we need solid
individuals to put in one hundred percent, yet people still can engage
without being heavily involved. Basically if you have not been doing ABC, or
related Prison work for at least 6 months to a year, then you will not be
within the confines of our "closed collective", you fall into play with the
- Friends of the ABC: the Austin ABC made a proposal (which may or may not
be taken up by other ABC's) in which those not able to be fully involved
(also due to a closed collective) but want to help in anyway can be a friend
of the ABC. This will involve anything from sending in monthly donations to
helping us with flyering and copying.
- Building Solidarity & the Network Idea: Lorenzo Kamboa Ervin's Network
(where most of our Draft Proposal took excerpts from), the draft online, and
solidarity with non-authoritarian antics yet still being organized. Us
building a Network will be a good example for ABC's worldwide. Holding each
other accountable, suggestions of calling each other weekly to contact and
check in- a cohesive bond. Monthly TX ABC meetings and calling each other
after meetings to check up on discussed projects. Emergency money needs to
be taken care of- proposal (which we may re-update the Draft Proposal on).
- Different types of Support: first off, letting the prisoners make the
rules- we do what they ask of us (obviously if it's within our grasps and
non-detrimental to the collective).
- Financial: try to get collective support for funds before sending out
money monthly, don't send, or promise, what you don't already have or can
afford. Work on creating that program. And do not send money to those you
don't know, or that a fellow collective member, in your collective, other
collective members- here and abroad, don't know, know the person first.
- Visitation: most would opt for a visit before money. Try and set up a base
to where collective members can rotate monthly, and make efforts to visit
PP's (of all kinds).
- Literature: send to who ever asks, if need be, ask for stamps (optional,
some prisoners DO have stamps to spare and would like it to be used for your
collective purposes).
- Letter Writing: avoid lovey dovey stuff (ask ex-prisoners) and be very up
front about your personal feelings and the type of business/friendship that
you engage in (follow up with other folks on this). Pros to help folks talk
in a legal manner that could, or would, involve an attorney. Make letters
look very neat and legit, send one to the Ombudsman, procedures for
complaints and investigation. Scrolled and ripped paper does no good. Ask
the prisoner to write down exactly what the problem is, who, when and where,
and who to write specifically about this matter. When writing about the
problem be very specific, polite, professional, yet stand up.
- Visitation: Prisoners, at least in TX, only get to change their visitation
list every 6 months and are only allowed 10 people per visit list, so make
sure that you do visit 'em whenever able to. But make sure that no one else
will be visiting on that day, and call the unit to make sure that you are on
their visit list and call before arriving at the unit, make sure they can
have a visit and that the unit isn't on lockdown. Schedule a time and date
with the prisoner. No paper money, no offensive clothing, no shorts, no hats
(this at least goes for TX, may or may not for other states) and make sure
that your ID is correct with what is on their list.
- Rules and Regulations: don't go in-between count time. Beware of mailroom
scrutiny. Don't talk about stuff that you wouldn't say to a cop.
Publisher/Distribution, the whole don't try and send books that you didn't
publish (aside from photo copied pamphlets). No threats to security in
publications or letters. Writing the Directors Review Committee, PO 99, does
no good.
- Things to Avoid (administration): bad attitudes and watch what you say.
- Prisoners: don't send literature with guns on it or advocating violent
nature of any kind. Don't get too personal with someone you don't know that
well, not a charitable organization, we are part of a larger political idea.
- Collectives: communication breaks, no duplication of work, no flakes.
Avoid making decisions without telling other collective members what your
plans are. Obviously no sexist, racist, homophobic, and the like, literature
or attitudes. Confront when one person is doing too much work. Don't assign
work to someone without notifying him or her first. Give deadlines. Give NO
false hopes.
- Lists- Literature: tabling stuff, keep it positive.
- Prisoners: let each other know who is writing whom.
- Active Groups: keep in contact so that we get things easily accomplished.
- Letter to prisoners: the Austin ABC will be, in the next month, writing up
a sheet of what we want to do and our ideas of the National Conference- to
go to 300 or so prisoners.
- Newsletter: we, the Austin ABC, have proposed an idea of a bi-monthly
newsletter that will go out to as many folks as possible (via mail, e-mail,
here and abroad) of what every TX ABC chapter has been doing in the past two
moths. It'll simply be an informative, yet simple and easy to do, newsletter
that will keep everybody posted as to what we've done and what we have
planned to do.
- Web: we would like to have a web-site set up that will keep tabs on every
TX ABC, which will probably just be the newsletter online, and any and all
ABC related matters. Most likely it'll be the web-site, but this is tentatively speaking.
- National Conference:
- Schedule: Friday and Saturday will be open to everyone (ABC, ABC
affiliates and those inquiring into the Conference in general) filled with
workshops, speakers and a side room that'll be showing films all day for
those that want to roam back and forth. Sunday will be entirely exclusive
to those who either want to start an ABC or for those who are already doing
ABC work. It will involve a lot of the same logistics that is played out
through our TX meet, but on a much larger scale. The goal is solidifying
our collectives towards a Network.
- Registration: the registration will have an attachment stating that there
will be the following supplied: food, shelter, child care, etc. And that if
anyone wants to speak or show a movie to please notify us upon release of
the registration form, please do so in a timely manner so that we can plan.
- Ideas for Films: Corrections, by Ashley Hunt. ABC's of ABC, we'll be cut
& pasting together a film that will be on the basics of ABC work that we'll
obtain through other films, so if you have a film that has some good info
on this please send it to us.
- Workshops: visitation, letter writing, education, consensus based
collectives, literature, bio's, film room during workshops- and speakers
that will be separate from it.
- Shows: we most likely will not be having any shows during this event, due
to staying focused on the initial agenda at hand. If one were to happen it
may at the end of Sundays event.
- Fundraisers: application for grants, tabling events, contacting other
prisoner support groups and other anarchist groups ingeneral.
Conclusion: monthly TX ABC meetings until the Conference so that we can
continue to organize our efforts for it and to continue to build our
solidarity with our TX ABC comrades! We'll be keeping everyone posted.
(FYI: After a long day of meetings and discussions we attended, and tabled,
an Austin ABC benefit show in which 4 local, and surrounding area, bands
played a great show. We got out lots of literature and made some cash!)
*Austin ABC Mission Statement: The Austin Anarchist Black Cross is an
autonomous collective of former PP's and concerned individuals dedicated to
the support of anarchist prisoners locally and abroad. We place the needs
and safety of the prisoner first and foremost, and allow them to dictate
the nature and type of support they receive. We provide correspondence,
educational and financial resources, as well as legal advice and
visitation. We also network with other autonomous ABC groups and many other
prisoner support organizations. We expose the truth about politically
motivated incarceration, conditions, and the exploitation, slavery, and
corruption that goes on inside the prison system. We lend support to
social, political, class war, drug war, and fight back prisoners. We commit
ourselves to forcing the community to accept responsibility for the welfare
of those who have sacrificed their freedom in attempts to bring the
anarchist movement forward. Our collective uses consensus based decision
making process. By facilitating an equality-based alternative, we hope to
transform the role of the prisoner into something more than martyrdom. We
make sure they are capable to live safely and are able to continue to
organize inside. We hope to uphold the values, ideas and tactics of the
original ABC. We feel that the only real job for the revolutionary is
getting away with it.

  In Wired today...
The crowd of approximately 150, assembled in a hotel ballroom just south of Central Park, did hear some subscription success stories.
Sony Online's Scott McDaniel, reported that his company had 424,000 subscribers at $10 per month for its wildly addictive role-playing game, Wall Street Journal Online publisher Neil Budde boasted 625,000 subscribers for his site, at an annual fee of either $59 or $29 (depending on whether they had a subscription to the Journal's print edition).
Playboy.com has 114,000 people paying a monthly fee of anywhere from $10 to $69, according to Randy Nicolau, an executive there. That's to be expected from one of the top adult media brands, because a large part of what little money is being spent on paid Internet content is blown on porn -- $273 million in a total market of $1.4 billion, according to Jupiter.
But these upbeat examples didn't appear to buoy the mood in the conference's ballroom
Another ray of hope at the conference came from the example of RealNetworks, which has attracted about 500,000 people to pay $10 per month for the RealOne Super Pass service. For that fee, subscribers get access to content from ABCNews.com, CNN.com, major league baseball and other services.
Like a cable television company, RealNetworks passes a portion of those fees to its media partners. ISPs and other Internet infrastructure firms might be able follow the lead of RealNetworks, Jupiter's Card said.
The cable-like model "better work," replied ABCNews.com executive Bernard Gershon. "Otherwise, we're all screwed."

straddling the cock and by turning her back to the boy. She can control
how deep she sits on the cock, according to her taste; this way, she has no pain, only pleasure.
It is very pleasant to see your cock between the two buttocks of the
woman you are sodomizing. If you are a considerate lover, you put your
hands under her buttocks in order to support her weight, and then she
can concentrate on the pleasure alone. If you wish to change positions, you can do like you see in the pictures; lay the woman on her stomach, her legs joined together, and slide your cock between the buttocks which are nice and firm in this position, and into the anus.Luv you babe.

War by Assassination
John Filiss
The capacity for warfare is both the ultimate justification and great curse of the state. And the problem of both war and the state is, sadly, one of the deepest tragedies of the human condition.
The following is one possible solution to the problem.
War as it has been played out throughout so much of history and into the present day accepts a basic authoritarian assumption that quite possibly accounts for almost the entire horror of warfare. That assumption is that a nation's leadership, and by implication the individuals who are instrumental in enacting a state of war, should be immune from the fray. The idea that warfare should consist of a clashing of arms between soldiers and often the populations of the afflicted countries is accepted without question, when in truth the first front of warfare should be against the perpetrators of war themselves...its leaders, architects, and profiteers.

Mother points the finger as son fears death in a Chinese jail
  Hunger strike threat ... Li Wang says the Government has not done enough for her son, Wang Jianping, whom the Chinese accuse of spying. Photo: Pat By Craig Skehan, Foreign Affairs Correspondent
Li Wang is 75, but determined. Her son, an Australian citizen, is in a Beijing jail accused of spying, and she was ready to go on a hunger strike if the Federal Government did not do more to help free him.
Now, however, she has agreed to postpone her planned protest after the Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, pledged to press his visiting Chinese counterpart over the case of Wang Jianping when they meet in Canberra tomorrow.
Mr Downer promised Mr Wang's ailing mother, who now lives alone in Canberra, that he would pursue the case in talks with Tang Jiaxuan, the first Chinese foreign minister to visit Australia in a decade.
A solicitor for the family, Chanaka Bandarage, said yesterday: "Mr Downer has been pretty slack. We are glad that he has now agreed to talk directly to Mr Tang. But Mr Downer must work for Mr Wang's urgent release as well as consular access."
Mr Wang, 52, who is in poor health, has written to Mr Downer saying he fears dying in jail.
He was accused of passing state secrets to Australian diplomat Murray McLean in the early 1980s and was sentenced to 10 years' jail. He escaped in 1986 and the Australian Government allowed him to settle here.
Mr Wang was re-arrested during a business trip to China in 1995 and was sentenced to an additional term for the escape.
The Wang family insists he entered China as an Australian citizen and that the Australian Government should be pressing more forcefully for consular access, better prison conditions and his prompt release.
Amnesty International says long periods of solitary confinement and poor food have contributed to Mr Wang's poor health and has demanded that Mr Downer give a public account of his dealings with China.
"Amnesty has been concerned that for quite a while the human rights dialogue between Australia and China has been occurring too much behind closed doors," a spokesman, Damien Spry, said yesterday.

TJ Hart and Tony Tedeschi meet with a seductive sex therapist - played by sultry Kelsey Hart. The couple are seeking counseling in an attempt to rid Tony of his addiction to porno magazines. (Why anyone would want to purge themselves of this awesome addiction is a mystery to me. But if this out-of-the-ordinary plotline helps get us that much quicker to the intercourse, then who really cares.)
I don't know about Tony, but my addiction to still sex photos would be over pretty quick if horny little TJ stripped down to her panties in front of me - as she does here at the request of her therapist. It looks like doing away with the clothes is some good advice because soon Kelsey and TJ are engaged in a wet clit cunnilingus session. Although there's no multiple angle option to use during the oral sex, the two curvaceous (and pointy nippled) blondes more than compensate by eating each other out from both the front and rear. Tony, for his part, eventually enters the fray and shows off his slit licking prowess as well. Apparently, though, he's not cured because he continues to flip through a nudey mag while getting his dick sucked. He also keeps perusing the porno periodical as he furiously fucks the shit out of both ladies. This scene ends off in fine fashion with Tedeschi screwing Kelsey doggy style while TJ sucks on his balls and ass from behind. Tony then bones TJ up the butt before raining some cum on the asses of the excited girls. A very "addictive" scene! It's one of the many on this tape that I actually went back to and watched again.

More than 300,000 join final big march against EU summit Up to 300,000 people joined a final protest march against the EU economic summit in Barcelona, according to first estimates by organizers. Marching behind a banner that declared: "Against a Europe of capital -- another world is possible," the overwhelmingly young demonstrators headed from Placa de Catalunya to the harborfront. A heavy contingent of riot police deployed in the streets as helicopters hovered overhead amid fears of a repeat of the street violence that has marred top-level EU gatherings in the past.  Organizers estimated the marchers at 300,000 to 500,000 while police said at least 140,000 had massed in the streets. Shops along the two-kilometer (mile-long) route drew their shutters, though some department stores remained open, their doors guarded by police in heavy flak jackets. Overhead, two police helicopters hovered noisily. Organizers, cheered by a week full of largely trouble-free protest actions, had been hoping for at least 100,000 participants -- even with a big soccer match between Barcelona and Real Madrid elsewhere in the city. The same number turned out Thursday for a boisterous but peaceful march along much the same route, organized by the mainstream European Trade Union Confederation. On Friday, as the two-day summit of EU heads of state and government got underway at a heavily guarded convention center, 24 people were detained in skirmishes with baton-wielding police in various parts of the city. Police said they were all Spaniards, except for one Swede and one Slovene. "In terms of participation and reach of our message, the activities of the day by far exceeded our targets," said the Campaign Against the Europe of Capital, a coalition of 150-odd groups that has been coordinating protests.  Security was tight throughout the EU summit, with 8,500 police officers -- many bused in from other parts of Spain -- in the bustling Catalan capital to guard against the double threat of street riots and Basque terrorist attacks. Several hundred people also demonstrated Saturday in the streets of the French town of Perpignan, close to the Spanish border, and planned to join the protesters in Barcelona. But for a third straight day, Spanish police at the border with France turned back cars and buses with people whom they suspected were planning to join Saturday's march. A further protest was planned in Perpignan later Saturday if the Spanish authorities maintained the measures. Spain starting checking ID papers of everyone coming into the country after it suspended the Schengen agreement on free movement between most EU member states for the duration of the summit. "Some people think that they can do things that do not meet the approval of the vast majority of the population," said Spanish Interior Minister Mariano Rajoy. "Action had to be taken." The EU leaders met at a convention center on the suburban northwest side of the city, surrounded by police armored cars and chain-link fences. Most if not all were expected to have left the city before Saturday's late-day march. The last big anti-globalization protest in Barcelona, in June last year during a World Bank meeting, led to violent clashes on the streets and a political debate in Spain over police brutality at demonstrations. ******************************* Alternative Press Review -  Your Guide Beyond the Mainstream PO Box 4710 - Arlington, VA 22204 Infoshop.org -  News Kiosk -

From a letter Chris Boyce wrote in 1977.
...To my perceptions,the foundations of this country are a sham.It was designed by the few
for the few and so it will ever remain.Western culture is in decline now and the trend cant
be reversed.We are grasping along in a headless insanity that will continue to consume till
nothing is left.
Time and time again I watched the destruction of those things and places I love and I was
disgusted.I belive we are on the edge of a poisoned horrible darkness.Industrialism and
technology are dragging humanity toward universal collapse and will take most life forms
with it.
I used to sit on silver spur road and shudder at the enormity of the lights of Los angeles
at night.To me it was always an infected spectacle.I lived in it and breathed in it.It was not
the people I hated.It was what had been blindly created,and so I just turned my back on it.
I ran my dog through the fields and I flew my Hawkes and Falcons and did everything I could
to shake things at their roots.I just do not accept the direction of this society.I could
not sit still for what we are leading to.I didnt think so then and I dont now.
from a later letter...What a simple thing life is,you can almost hold it in your hand...
I'm not a complex man and my tenets are quite simple,I have always abhorred the national
patriots and can dismiss them because their days are numbered just as surely as were those
of the primordial leviathans.A century must sound to you like an age but it is actually a
mere moment in the history of man.Your great grandchildren will enjoy the birth of the
tranquil milleneum,the one world.The evolution of a global society devoid of competing
militarianism will be a greenhouse of worthful development.
If I am mad they are all the madder for the thousands of nuclear weapons they are prepared
to unleash upon each other.
I have made my life a study of aggression and the carnivores,and humanity is the most self
predatory species in existence.I am ashamed of the history of the nations and of my own
origins and someday so will all of united humanity.To belive otherwise is to bankrupt
pessimism.Not in your lifetime,nor mine,nor any living mans,but someday they will all under-
stand.The past will be judged as ignorant and grisly barbarity.That someday will be the dawn
of mankinds redemption and the new treason is the rejection of nationalistic society and its
exploitive and butchering adjuncts.These were my dreams,alone with my falcons,do you think
me deranged too?
Like Camus,my subconscious is plagued with lifes purposelessness and therein lies my inner
peace.I am neither conservative or socialistic.I cherish friendships with the back country,
wind and rain,the seasons and the spontaneous hazards of the wilds.
Ive always viewed myself as a spectator of the great human void rushing toward what it knows
not.I long ago excused myself from the mad dash,to find my own sanctuaries,So falconry and history
have always attracted me.

Covert bid to bug Labor
By Brendan Nicholson
Political Correspondent
March 17 2002
Australia's spy agency ASIO was asked if it could bug the parliamentary office of senior Labor MP Laurie Brereton by Defence Department investigators under pressure from the government to find the source of embarrassing leaks on East Timor.
The Sunday Age has learnt that the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Denis Richardson, confirmed in a confidential briefing to senior Labor figures last month that this extraordinary attempt to breach the privileged status of parliament occurred during the investigation into defence leaks, which began in 1999.
The government yesterday confirmed the briefing had taken place, and said it included Labor leader Simon Crean and Mr Brereton.
According to one source, Mr Richardson told the opposition that officers of the Australian Federal Police and the Special Investigation Unit of the Defence Department's Defence Security Branch asked his organisation whether its special powers could be used to put listening devices in Mr Brereton's Mr Richardson said ASIO refused the request on the grounds that it fell outside his organisation's brief, which was to investigate espionage.
Mr Brereton declined to reveal the specifics of any briefing, but confirmed to The Sunday Age his understanding that the AFP and Defence Security had both raised with ASIO the question of bugging his parliamentary office. He said he had been assured that ASIO had rejected the suggestion.
According to the source, Mr Richardson said at the briefing that the federal police and defence officers told ASIO they lacked the legal power to bug the office themselves.
Government sources confirmed that the bugging issue was raised with ASIO, but denied that any official request was involved. They said a junior officer attached to Defence asked an ASIO officer if Mr Brereton's office could be bugged.
The ASIO officer said it would not be legal to bug an MP's office in parliament as it was beyond the agency's powers, the government sources said.
The request to ASIO came from police and defence security officers under great political pressure to find the sources of leaks that had embarrassed Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Department.
The leaks made it clear that the Australian Government knew much more than it was letting on in 1999 about the extent of high-level Indonesian military involvement in plans for a bloodbath in East Timor. At the time, Mr Downer's public line was that the carnage was the work of low-level "rogue elements" in the Indonesian forces.
The government was also embarrassed because the leaks revealed to the United States that Australia had been withholding information from its key The investigations that followed are believed to have cost about $1 million. They tied up significant AFP and intelligence resources for well over a year, damaged the careers of some military officers and resulted in not a single criminal charge being laid.
One source said Mr Richardson contacted the opposition on February 20 after an article appeared in The Canberra Times about the alleged bugging request quoting an unnamed "whistleblower".
Mr Richardson sought to reassure the opposition that ASIO had not helped bug the office and arrived at Parliament House the following day to meet the Labor MPs.
He told them that the proposition that the office should be bugged had come from both AFP and defence security officers, the source said.
Mr Richardson told the opposition that ASIO refused the request. He said he had insisted that a record of the bugging episode should be drafted and placed on file. "The big question left unanswered by all this," said the source, "is whether someone else did the bugging."
Mr Richardson told The Sunday Age he could not comment in any way about the incident, including "on whether I even went to Mr Crean's office". "Under the ASIO Act the person in my job is required to consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition and when I do have contact with him that's not a matter for public discussion as far as I'm concerned," he said.
Approached by The Sunday Age on Friday, a federal police spokesman said: "We would categorically reject the claim that the AFP sought to have a listening device placed in Mr Brereton's office. It's not true."
A spokeswoman for Attorney-General Daryl Williams said that under the legislation covering ASIO's operations the director-general was required to consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition.
When the original newspaper claim was made a month ago, Mr Williams and the director-general took the view that Mr Crean should be given an accurate briefing rather than have the matter left hanging.
The spokeswoman said the issue was of concern because ASIO was required to consult with Mr Crean on security issues and the content of a briefing had become public.

* Zimbabwe now has it's own Indy Media Centre * Two presidents resigned on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean
rather than give the green light to a new Prevention of Terrorism Act. Mass
protests complained that the law was an infringement of human rights and an
attack on the country's sovereignty, because it allows the CIA to interfere
in national affairs. The law was eventually passed when the Chief Justice
became president.
Inside SchNEWS Ever wondered why anti-capitalist protesters always get over
the top sentences for minor offences? Well, the Legal Defence and
Monitoring Group (LDMG) have uncovered secret documents that tell judges to
come down hard on activists. These documents were being passed to Crown and
Youth Court judges after both May Day 2000 and May Day Monopoly 2001
festivities. The document titled "Mayhem" came to the attention of LDMG in
June 2001 at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court. The defence barrister Ed Rees
QC asked to look at the document, but the court refused this on the grounds
that it was secret! Sentencing in England and Wales is supposedly based on
individual circumstances and the seriousness of the offence, but clearly in
the case of anti-capitalists this is not the case. Glaring examples of over
the top prison terms are Roger Davis who got 3 months for threatening words
and behaviour, which results in a fine at worst; Karl Hodgkinson got 15
months for affray; and another person received a  fine for common
assault (the lowest form of assault). Paul Jones, spokesperson for LDMG
told SchNEWS "The police have spent millions of pounds preventing the May
Day actions from proceeding peacefully and in prosecuting people for minor
offences. Now we discover that the judiciary is instructed to send those
convicted to prison. Even the pretence of justice has been abandoned. We
demand an amnesty for all May Day protestors." LDMG 07949 061 333 e:

Last month in the Ecuadorian Amazon provinces of Sucumbios and Orellana thousands of striking construction workers and local residents protesting against the new oil pipeline were attacked by the country's armed forces. Three children were killed by asphyxiation from tear gas, close to forty people were arrested and over three hundred people were wounded after the military crackdown ordered by President Gustavo Noboa. Demonstrators occupied over 60 oil wells and 5 refineries-halting all construction on the pipeline bringing oil production to a near standstill and erected roadblocks. Nearby in the highland cloud forests of the Mindo, people continue to put their lives on the line by tree-sitting to block the pipeline's passage. The government declared a state of emergency for the provinces in defence of the oil multinationals, immediately suspending civil rights, and invoking the military to break up the demonstrations while the local radio stations were kept off the air. Meanwhile on Monday Indian tribal leaders from Ecuador began the lengthy and expensive process of taking Chevron-Texaco to the US courts. This groundbreaking environmental class-action lawsuit, the first filed by foreigners in a U.S. court, is being watched closely to see if federal courts find American corporations accountable to crimes abroad. "We simply want Chevron-Texaco to pay to clean up the damage it caused." The lawsuit asserts that Texaco installed defective drilling technology that led to the spillage of millions of gallons of toxic wastewater over a 20-year period. Rather than pump the poisonous water back into the ground - as is the industry standard, and as Chevron-Texaco does in the United States - they dumped it into hundreds of unlined pits. From the pits, the wastewater contaminated with oil and heavy metals slowly poisoning the rivers and wetlands of Ecuador. "To Chevron-Texaco, the clean-up costs represent a small fraction of its annual profits," said prosecuting lawyer Joseph Kohn, "To our clients in the Amazon, this is a matter of life or death." " Texaco and Occidental Petroleum have extracted more that $60 billion dollars worth of oil from these provinces in the last 30 years, yet 90% of the region's population lives in poverty. Despite the huge profits from oil the locals surprise, surprise have seen none of the loot and all of the pillaging has left them impoverished and sick with cancer.  * At the end of last month a court gave the go ahead for the families of Ken Saro-Wiwa to take Shell/Dutch Petroleum to court for participation in crimes against humanity, torture, summary execution, arbitrary detention, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Environmentalist activist and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and eight other Ogoni activists were hanged by the Nigerian military government in 1995. The 'Ogoni Nine' had opposed Shell's pollution and oil development in the Niger Delta. Saro-Wiwa told the military tribunal that sentenced him to death, "Shell is here on trial. The Company has, indeed, ducked this particular trial, but its day will surely come..." Judith Chomsky, Attorney for the prosecution commented , "Shell had direct involvement in human rights violations against the Ogoni people. Any company that profits from crimes against humanity should be brought to justice wherever they are." Lawsuits have also been filed against Exxon-Mobil by people from Indonesia's embattled Aceh province, Members of ethnic minorities in Myanmar (formerly Burma) against Unocal And Chevron-Texaco (again) by other Nigerian groups:

Spain,Report on Repression in Barcelona Friday, 15th March 2002
At 13.00 o'clock there was a demonstration planned the Liceo metro stop in Barcelona. Its slogan was "Capitalism can't be reformed, it must be destroyed. The rich also cry". The first thing the police did was identify demonstrators gathering at the start-point. Without the demonstration even having started, police attacked demonstrators and arrested someone (at least twenty photographers captured this moment). It's important no know that all demonstrators have done has been to shout. Never has there been any attack against police on their part. It's obvious that police's aim was not to control the demonstration but to directly avoid there being any demonstration at all. After this first charge there have been a few others, but not very strong. What police managed was to divide demonstrators, although they managed to get together again. For quite a while there have been several small charges, probably more to frighten people than to actually arrest anybody. However, every time demonstrators got back together. It's important to understand we're not talking about a battle between police and demonstrators. Rather than that, we're talking about demonstrators standing in front of police and drawing back when charges took place and then going back when police went back to where they had been. At one point, police got in their vans and apparently left. Demonstrators said good-bye shouting insulting and spitting at them. However, one or two vans stayed in front of the Liceo. Suddenly, the police in those vans attacked and that made demonstrators run up Las Ramblas a bit. But when they went up, they found that the vans that had left had parked all along Las Ramblas up to Plaza Cataluqa. So while demonstrators ran up because police was charging from below, more police was coming from the side. Some people went into side streets, where some ball shots were heard (in Spain police often uses guns that shoot something kind of like hard tennis balls to get rid of crowds). At the Plaza Cataluqa there were hardly any demonstrators left. What happened on the side streets we don't know. Many demonstrators had their own cameras and video-cameras. There were also many official journalists. Police didn't doubt to attack both. Once again, we see the real side of the EU that is being built. And we are not going to shut up. Police murderers.

An earlier report...from barcelona.indymedia.org Fighting, barricades, burnings and rubber bullets. Tension is rising at the "Mars Attacks" demonstration on the upper part of the Ramblas. At 2.30pm the police violently baton-charged 800 people (which included people wearing black with covered faces), with the intention of clearing the street of people, who thus poured into side streets. Many bars have closed, thus stopping people from taking refuge. Some groups of people tried to stage a sit-down protest, but the police charges became increasingly violent until, at 20.30 the entire upper part of the Ramblas was in a state of siege. Barricades in flames, arrests, rubber bullets and injured journalists. Many journalists have been able to photograph the events. The TV3 news programme has stated that "the demonstration on the Ramblas is proceeding without incident"! In the concentration at Liceu, about halfway down the Ramblas, the situation is normal and people continue to demonstrate.
The battle for barcelona chapter in "Durruti.the people armed,"by Abel Paz is good background for those interested.

Microsoft's Coziness with U.S. Justice Department
I was accused of sheer paranoia last fall when I suggested that the U.S. Justice Department's malodorous antitrust deal with Microsoft had the smell of something more sinister -- that the company and government had agreed to collaborate on law enforcement matters. (Here's Google's cached version of that column.)
Please note this Reuters story, in which Steve Ballmer explains how Microsoft is "working closely" with the Justice Department to fight cyber-crime -- but that any such dealings are, of course, confidential. No Now remember that Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself (CNN) from the Enron investigation because his Missouri Senate campaign (he lost the election to a dead man) got thousands in contributions from the corrupt energy-trading company. Ashcroft got thousands from Microsoft but didn't recuse himself (Sacramento Bee) in the antitrust case.
Keep this in mind, too: One of the provisions in this deal allows the government to order Microsoft not to disclose APIs and other technology, if the government decides such disclosure would be damaging. I've asked both the company and the department what this means, and I can't begin to comprehend Microsoft's doubletalk. The Justice Department basically refused to discuss it at all.

From March 12th to 18th is taking place a hunger strike in several spanish prisons. The prisoners are claiming: -The supression of FIES (1) regime and all the isolament units. -The end of penitentiary dispersal (2). -The release of all prisoners with incurable illness (like AIDS, Cancer, etc). -The release of all prsoners who have spent more than 20 years in prison (the maximum time according the law). This mobilization is included in a collective struggle inside the prisons, against the FIES units and for the dignity of the prisoners. This is a revolutionary struggle because it4s not only aimed to a mere reform, but ultimately its goal is the disappearance of the prisons, which involves a radical social change. It4s a self-organizated struggle, in which there aren4t leaders or representatives, neither inside the prisons nor outside, but only solidarity that grows between exploited people both from inside and outside the walls. A hunger strike is an important moment of the struggle, but the repression is constant, so our struggle should be also. /FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THE PRISONS AND THE SYSTEM WHICH HAS BUILT THEM/ (1) FIES [Ficheros de Internos de Especial Seguimiento - Inmates Files of Special Monitoring] units are very hard isolament units of the spanish prisons in which prisoners are subjected to a total control all day. Their mail and phone calls are monitored, they have few opportunities to stay with other prisoners, their belongings are always been inspected, and tortures are usual. The prisoners who are included in this Files are the rebel ones, those who doesn4t submit to the prison authority. (2) The penitentiary dispersal means that prisoners are sent to prisons far away of their homelands and their families and friends. This means mainly an additional punishment for the family or near people, who have to travel a lot of kilometers (in some cases, hundreds or thousands) in order to stay some minutes with their dear people in a visit.

'Democracy isn't always pretty'
2 anti-war protesters discuss cases before WVU's ACLU
Jim Bissett/The Dominion Post
John Tinker, of Missouri, (left) and Katie Sierra, of
Sissonville, talk about free speech Wednesday night at WVU
as guests of the university's ACLU chapter. Both were
suspended from their high schools for speaking out against
BY JIM BISSETT
The Dominion Post
Katie Sierra apologized to the audience of 40 or so people
who came to WVU Wednesday night to hear her talk about civil
liberties and freedom of speech.
"OK, let me start over," Sierra said to the crowd in a
lecture hall of the Business and Economics Building. "I get
a little nervous in front of people. I'm sorry."
Hardly the talk of a revolutionary, but Sierra, 15, became a
reluctant one last October when she wore a T-shirt scrawled
with an anti-war message to Sissonville High School.
It was a month after the terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington, and Sierra, who had also tried to start an
anarchist club at her school, turned her shirt into a
sarcastic indictment of the U.S. assault on Afghanistan in
the hunt for suspected Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.
The wording on her shirt: "When I saw the dead and dying
Afghani children on TV, I felt a newly recovered sense of
national security. God Bless America."
Her principal, Forrest Mann, said the shirt was offensive
and inappropriate. He suspended her for two weeks.
Sierra, speaking in Morgantown as a guest of the WVU chapter
of the American Civil Liberties Union, said she was upset
and scared -- but that she tried to stand her ground.
"I cried," she said, "but I did tell him, 'You can't do
this.' I mean, I knew my free-speech rights."
When she came to school two weeks later, she was roughed up
in a hallway, in full view of a security camera, she said,
by four students who shouted insults and shoved her into
The students went unpunished, but Sierra sued the Kanawha
County Board of Education for suspending her in the first
John Tinker, who traveled to WVU with her, knows exactly how
she feels.
Now a computer engineer who lives in Missouri, Tinker, too,
was 15 years old when he ran afoul of the administration of
his Des Moines, Iowa, high school in 1965 as the Vietnam War
was heating up.
He wore a black arm band to school in protest, and didn't
take it off until he took his case all the way to the
country's highest court. The Supreme Court ruled in his
favor in a decision that expanded student rights.
"It's all about democracy," Tinker said, "and democracy
isn't always pretty. Sometimes you need to get in someone's
face, so to speak, to start a dialogue."
Tinker, softspoken like Sierra, said the Sissonville case
comes down to a student being denied the right to learn and
speak her mind -- simply because her school didn't agree
with her.
"That's all she wanted to do," he said. "She wanted to study
a topic and her school said no. She was assaulted, and her
school's administrators didn't do anything."
Sierra, who has lived in Panama, New Mexico, Ohio and
Kentucky as she moved around the country with her father --
who was first in the military, then a civilian employee of
the military -- withdrew from Sissonville and is now being
home schooled.
Her appearance in Morgantown came one day after she and
Tinker were banned from speaking to an ACLU group at
Huntington High School.
"All I wanted to do was start a club," she said, shaking her
head. "I didn't think all this was going to happen."
Andrew Schneider, executive director of the West Virginia
ACLU, who introduced the pair, said Sierra better get used
to it.
"Civil liberty battles never stay won," he said.
The trio appeared at WVU just two weeks after a group of
students squared off against the university administration
over the issue of specially designated "free-speech zones"
that they say are consigning campus activists to outlying
areas away from the students they're trying to reach.
So what would have happened if Sierra had worn one of her
anti-war T-shirts to WVU last fall?
"Well, it was such a hot issue," ACLU campus president Mary
Bess said, "that she probably would have been asked to move
to the free speech zone."

@_subject: Anarchism in dark times 
Community attitudes to anarchists range from impractical utopians to
terrorist ogres who eat babies brains for breakfast.  Few if any positive
stereotypes exist within communities about anarchists and anarchist
objectives and strategies.  Working within such a milieu can sap the energy
of even the most dedicated activist.  The climate created by such negative
stereotypes, can and does wear away at the confidence we have in ourselves,
our ideas, our objectives and strategies.
In such a negative environment it9s important we don9t begin to become the
stereotypes other people have created for us and our movement.  Time and
time again, anarchists movements have taken on the characteristics that the
community has created for them, carrying out actions that reinforce those
negative stereotypes.  It9s important we don9t let other people define who
we are and what we stand for.  We are the only ones who can and should
define our ideas, goals, objectives and strategies.  Letting the State, the
corporate sector or community do this for us is a dead end one way journey
to oblivion.
At the end of the day confidence is everything, not a confidence based on
superiority, but a confidence based on knowledge, that we as individuals and
as members of a movement have something to offer those communities we live
and work in.  Anarchism is an inclusive ideology that ultimately relies on
mass participation.  It is the only ideology that honestly and genuinely
welcomes participation.  It9s strength lies in its ability to tap into the

@_subject: Anarchist Q+A.The nuclear family. 
ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER
Q  What role will the nuclear family play in an anarchist society?
A  Human beings are capable of an infinite variety of human relationships.
A cursory glance through the historical records combined with a journey
across current cultural and geographical boundaries, throws up a myriad
combination of possible human relationships.  Anarchist relationships are
ultimately based on choice.  Not a choice limited by necessity or curtailed
by cultural or gender issues but a choice that9s based on access to
resources and power.
What relationships occur in an anarchist society will develop over time.
Access to wealth will not determine the type of relationships which will
develop.  As everybody has access to the wealth created by community they
live in, access to resources can9t be used as a bargaining chip to determine
what type if relationships develop.  This doesn9t mean that emotional
factors don9t play a role in the type of relationships developed, what it
does mean is that emotional factors will take precedence over economic
Allowing a wide range of human relationships to exist within a community,
does not mean that problems that develop within human relationships wont
occur, they will still occur with the same monotonous regularity.  What will
happen is that individuals will have a greater range of emotional choices to
explore within an anarchist community.  Whether the nuclear family will
survive or even prosper, is a matter for conjecture.  What is important is
that structure are created which offer choice and protect the more
vulnerable members of the community.
As for human relationships are concerned. Predators will still exist in an
anarchist society.  What type of role they are able to play and the damage
they are able to cause will be minimized in an anarchist community, because
of the open nature of that community.  At the end of the day, we need to
understand that the majority of the sexual abuse that occurs in our society,
is perpetrated by people who are able to abuse the trust they enjoy and the
power they exercise, creating structures that limit the power people are
able to exercise will decrease the amount of abuse that people can get away

ACC call - All out for INS demo, Sat Mar 16
The New York City Anti-Capitalist Convergence is calling on all anarchists to join in the weekly rally at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Brooklyn, Saturday, March 16, 12 noon - 1pm, in solidarity with the Arab, South Asian, and Muslim immigrants being detained there. They are among the
hundreds of people who were unjustly rounded up and detained following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and have been held ever since in violation of their
civil and human rights.
We're calling on all anarchists to support the coalition working on behalf of the detainees and to highlight our opposition to state persecution of Muslims, people of color, and those who oppose US policy in the Middle East and Central Asia. The ACC pledges to respect the tactics and protocols
adopted by the coalition and offers its help in delivering a powerful message of defiance to state repression and denial of human rights during the so-called
"war on terrorism." Just as anarchists - many of them immigrants - took the brunt of state repression at Haymarket Square and in the Sacco-and-Vanzetti in years past, so do Muslim immigrants from the Middle East today.
Please join us at 11:30am on Saturday, a half hour before the scheduled start of the rally. The Metropolitan Detention Center is located at 29th Street and
3rd Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Take the N or R trains to the 25th Street and 4th Avenue stop.
The demonstration is sponsored by: Freedom Legal Defense and Education Project, Arab-American Family Support Center. Cosponsored by: American
Association of Jurists; Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund; Brooklyn Bridges, Brooklyn Heights Peace Action, Brooklyn Parents for Peace,
Coalition for the Human Rights of Immigrants, DRUM, Labor Against the War (NYCLAW), Pakistan League of America; Prospect Lefferts Voices for Peace and

Unparliamentary behaviour reported in the house
By Ian Munro
March 14 2002
The English have long demonstrated that sex and politics do mix, if not quite in the manner demonstrated last week in the Northern Territory The territory's honourable members, at least, were in recess late on Friday when a government staffer and his girlfriend are believed to have had sex in the parliamentary chamber.
Initially their coupling occurred in the Speaker's chair, but they also pushed aside the Despatch Box to make room on the chamber's central table according to claims made in Darwin yesterday.
The Clerk of the NT Parliament, Ian McNeill, yesterday examined security video footage and security access records to determine who had access to the chamber about 10.30pm on Friday in order to prepare a report to the Speaker Loraine Braham.
Ms Braham said that after confirming a former ministerial staff member had made an unauthorised entry to the chamber, she was considering asking the Director of Public Prosecutions if there was a case to answer
"I am investigating my powers as Speaker under the Powers and Privileges Act to prohibit the offenders from entering the parliamentary precinct again," she said.
The Opposition Whip first raised concerns about the claims that were aired on Darwin radio yesterday morning, Mr McNeill said.
It appeared the couple gained access to the chamber through an area occupied by the opposition. "(This) is one of those days you reckon you should have played golf," he said.
He said security cameras outside the chamber, and coded access cards would register who was in the surrounds of the chamber late on Friday.
"We have a few members to talk to," Mr McNeill said.FROM

Silence over a crime against humanity
International Editor Hamish McDonald reveals the critical evidence Australia's spy chiefs have kept hidden, as trials begin in Jakarta today over violence during East Timor's independence vote.
The evidence is contained in the most tightly held archive in Canberra: the electronic data base of the Defence Signals Direct-orate (DSD), the result of months intercepting secret communications between Indonesian officers involved in a shadowy campaign to thwart East Timorese hopes of independence in 1999.
Some details of this vast intelligence record have been revealed for the first time to the Herald by senior defence community sources in Canberra. They are dismayed at a huge crime against humanity, committed on Australia's doorstep and under the eyes of the United Nations, remaining The DSD intercepts map out the chain of command, from the local militias and covert Indonesian forces in East Timor up to one of the most feared military men in Jakarta, General Feisal Tanjung, whose involvement has so far escaped mention in human rights investigations.
The defence sources also say that some of this critical intelligence in the first half of 1999, pointing to high-level Indonesian involvement, was not included in intelligence exchanged with United States' agencies at a time when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was blaming the militia violence on "rogue elements" in the Indonesian army.
The tensions this caused between Canberra's Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) have been seen as contributing to the June 1999 suicide of the DIO liaison officer in Washington, Lieutenant-Colonel Merv Jenkins, after he was questioned by DFAT security officials about "Australian Eyes Only" material shared with American counterparts.
The intercepts, contained in files classified as "Secret Spoke" (meaning derived from intercepted clear-voice telephone calls) or "Top Secret Umbra" (derived from encrypted or scrambled voice communications), have not been shared with UN or other investigators.
But they include details of command and communications hierarchies that would provide vital evidence for international-standard war crimes tribunals, such as those prosecutions being mounted in The Hague against politicians and generals in the former Yugoslavia.
Instead of setting up such a tribunal for East Timor, the UN has stood back for 21/2 years to let Jakarta fulfil its promise to mount its own trials of those responsible for the 1999 massacres, abductions, coerced population movements and destruction.
In Jakarta, the first trial is due to begin today, with former East Timor governor Abilio Soares and former provincial police chief Brigadier-General Timbul Silaen accused of crimes against humanity involving widespread attacks on civilians.
Silaen is one of three generals among the 18 military personnel and civilian militia leaders accused of participation or responsibility in some of the more large-scale acts of murder in 1999. The other two are Major-General Adam Damiri, former head of the Udayana regional command, which included East Timor, and Brigadier-General Tono Suratman, who was East Timor military commander for much of 1999.
To the extent they face substantial punishment the three still seem to be in the pipeline for promotion within the army and police these generals and a number of colonels and junior officers appear to be the sacrifices to appease foreign and local concerns.
The senior generals who were more closely supervising the militia campaign on the ground in East Timor, and who reported directly to top military figures in Jakarta, have been left off the list of accused, although some were named as suspects in Indonesia's special human rights commission report in February 2000.
So far, it appears the Indonesian legal process, while concentrating on specific incidents of terror, has not attempted to lay overall blame for the militia campaign ahead of the August 30, 1999, vote, or for the systematic drive after the result was announced to deport the population and lay waste to the territory.
The Indonesian armed forces commander and defence minister at the time, General Wiranto, was forced to resign from his later cabinet post as co-ordinating political and security minister after the February 2000 report said he carried moral responsibility for the violence, given that Indonesia had guaranteed security for East Timor's referendum.
But now Wiranto also appears to be a fall guy, in terms of political, if not legal, responsibility. In all the inquiries so far, little attention has been given to the role of Feisal Tanjung, Wiranto's predecessor as armed forces commander then as political-security minister, whose pivotal role in instigating, planning and executing the militia campaign is brought into focus by the DSD intercepts.
Normally, the political-security position in the Indonesian cabinet has little executive responsibility or clout within the Indonesia military, compared with that of the commander. But the weighting of the two roles seems to have been reversed in 1999 because of the personalities and records of the officers involved.
Wiranto was a sociable some say weak political general who had risen to senior ranks through his positions in the entourage of former president Soeharto, who had been forced out of office by popular protest in May 1998. Throughout 1999 he kept an eye out for his prospects in Jakarta as political parties courted the powerful military following general elections in June.
TOUGH-minded Feisal Tanjung had spent much of his career in the feared Special Forces, known as Kopassus, or the paratroop units of the Strategic Reserve. He had associations with operations in East Timor from the earliest occupation days in 1975.
Tanjung appears to have operated a chain of command parallel to that wielded by General Wiranto, using officers with Kopassus and East Timor backgrounds, especially the two major-generals Zacky Anwar Makarim and Sjafrie Sjamsuddin assigned as "liaison officers" to the UN mission running the ballot in East Timor.
Most of these officers were, like Tanjung, associated with the "Green" or conspicuously Islamic faction active in the Indonesian forces in the last years of the Soeharto era. Wiranto and key aides like then lieutenant-general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono belonged to the "Red and White" or more secular nationalist faction (the name derived from Indonesia's national flag).
Because of his political ambitions, Wiranto may have been happy to distance himself from the dirty work involved in keeping East Timor within Indonesia. His colleagues may have been equally content to preserve his political acceptability in order to maintain the military's privileged position. This meant the crescendo of protests made to Wiranto by Canberra and other foreign capitals about the obvious military collusion with the militias went to the wrong address. Equally, Wiranto's promises of fair behaviour by the security forces carried little weight.
According to the Defence sources, the Indonesian embassy in Canberra was also out of the loop. DSD intercepted several queries by the then defence attache in Canberra, Brigadier-General Judi Magio Yusuf, to his Jakarta superiors asking for clarification of atrocities being reported from East Timor. He was routinely told these were foreign press fabrications and to ignore them.
Nine specific intercepts detailed by the Defence sources, plus accounts of other patterns of command and consultation at critical points in 1999, reveal some of the key officers and strategies in the covert campaign to retain East Timor.
On February 9 less than a fortnight after then president Habibie's announcement that the East Timorese would have an early choice between wider autonomy within Indonesia or independence DSD intercepted messages confirming that two Indonesian special forces units, codenamed Tribuana and Venus, had arrived in East Timor to join undercover operations.
The East Timor military command, abbreviated to Korem 164, had already been using armed local auxiliaries and militias since the latter months of 1998 to counter the popular unrest that had been growing since Soeharto's fall.
On February 14, DSD heard the Dili militia leader Eurico Guterres telephone the Tribuana unit about the condition of an injured member of the militia group, which was called Mahidi. Tribuana told Guterres: "We know that Brig-Gen Simbolon is concerned that one of his crew is injured."
This refers to then Brigadier-General Mahidin Simbolon, who was chief of staff in the Bali-based Udayana regional command, which included East Timor. A former East Timor commander, Simbolon was close to the Mahidi leader Cancio de Cavalho, whose coined name for the group (Mahidi, from the Indonesian words meaning "Live or Die for Integration") was a tribute to the Indonesian officer.
On May 5, Indonesia's commander in East Timor, then Colonel Tono Suratman, was intercepted phoning Guterres to ask where he was massing his militia group for a show of force in Dili, the territory's capital. Guterres reported 400 militias waiting outside a city hotel.
On June 1, DSD intercepted Colonel Suratman telling Guterres: "Don't deal with me directly. Contact me via Bambang [referring to Major Bambang Wisnumurti, the intelligence chief in Suratman's command]."
On August 8, DSD intercepted a message from military headquarters in Jakarta, allocating radio frequencies for use by pro-Indonesian groups. This was one of a series of frequency allocations that were intercepted routine signals but the kind that provide crucial pieces of evidence for war crimes prosecutors. The point of contact for the militia groups was another intelligence officer, a Lieutenant Masbuku, in Suratman's Korem 164 headquarters in Dili.
On August 9, a message stated that Director "A" in Jakarta's military intelligence agency BAIS, a Brigadier-General Arifuddin, had organised flags and other material for a demonstration against Unamet, the UN mission. Arifuddin said 5000 T-shirts had been prepared, and 10,000 ordered.
In intercepts in a file dated September 4, and classified "Top Secret Umbra", Major-General Zacky Anwar Makarim is making last minute calls to find out how the count of the votes from five days earlier is going (the result, a 78.5 per cent majority for independence, was later announced by the UN that morning).
Anwar spoke to a police officer named Andreas and asked how the count was going. The police officer said that with 50 per cent of the vote counted, only about 20 per cent seemed to be for the autonomy-within-Indonesia option. Anwar appeared incredulous, asking: "Are you sure? How can it be?" He pointed out that all across East Timor, households had been displaying the red and white Indonesian flag.
Anwar also spoke to Brigadier-General Glenny Kairupan, head of another special team appointed by General Feisal Tanjung, for pointers to the impending result, and to the East Timorese activist leading Jakarta's political campaign in the ballot, Basilio Araujo who said it was obvious the poll was fixed.
While speaking to Araujo, General Anwar also asked him to keep a close eye on Eurico Guterres. Anwar said Guterres had a relative who was a Catholic nun, and might easily be persuaded to jump to the independence side. "I'll take care of him if he goes over to the other side," Anwar said.
ONCE the ballot's result was announced on September 4, the Indonesian authorities on the ground moved quickly to adapt existing contingency plans for evacuation of pro-integration elements and Indonesian residents.
Across the central and western parts of East Timor, people were driven from their homes and shepherded to land or sea transport to West Timor or other parts of Indonesia. The aim, apparently, was to discredit the UN ballot as rigged, by suggesting that a majority of Timorese were voting with their feet in accordance with their true wishes, or to create conditions for partition of the territory. Over the grim two weeks this scheme was carried out, before the arrival of the Australian-led international force Interfet on September 20, DSD picked up numerous scrambled telephone conversations between General Tanjung in Jakarta and General Anwar in Timor discussing details, the Defence sources say.
In addition, DSD intercepted other discussions about the population transfer involving General Anwar and two ministers in the Habibie government, both with intelligence and special forces backgrounds. One was Lieutenant-General A.M.Hendropriyono, the minister for the former inter-island "transmigration" scheme, the other Lieutenant-General Yunus Yosfiah, the information minister.
On September 21, as Interfet was still landing troops in Dili and establishing an uneasy interregnum with Indonesian forces, DSD intercepted a phone call to the veteran pro-Indonesian political leader Francisco Xavier Lopez da Cruz, informing him that Kopassus had formed special hit-squads code-named "Kiper-9" to hunt down pro-independence elements and pro-Indonesian figures who changed sides.
A final intercept revealed by the sources, reported on October 5, details a message from the East Nusatenggara provincial police commander to the police chief in the provincial capital Kupang (in West Timor). The local police chief is reminded that some visitors from the US State Department are about to visit camps holding relocated East Timorese. He is to make sure the visitors get the impression the refugees are free of harassment.
The generals who figure in the command chain of this campaign aside from Damiri, Suratman and Silaen are all free of legal charge. Feisal Tanjung is active in party politics since losing ministerial office with the end of the Habibie presidency in October 1999, along with former information minister Yunus Yosfiah. Damiri's former chief of staff in the Udayana command, Mahidin Simbolon, has been promoted to his own command, in Papua, where local independence activists fear he could pursue a militia strategy against them, and where Kopassus soldiers are suspected of murdering the Papuan Council leader Theys Eluay.
Zacky Anwar Makarim remains in the army, attached to the TNI headquarters without specific assignment. Sjafrie Sjamsuddin, who is among army officers resisting legal summonses to testify on violence against students in early 1998 (when he was Jakarta garrison chief), has been appointed official TNI The former transmigration minister who helped organise the mass deportations in September 1999, General Hendropriyono, has had a revived career, being made head of the new National Intelligence Body created by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, whom he had cultivated in her opposition years against Soeharto.
Only the decades of impunity enjoyed by the Indonesian security forces make the country's leadership unabashed by the irony that Hendropriyono and Sjamsuddin are now the public faces of a TNI and intelligence service being asked to join the War against Terror.

Australia's bloody East Timor secret
Spy intercepts confirm Government knew of Jakarta's hand in massacres
By Hamish McDonald, International Editor
The Australian Government sat on explosive intelligence material which showed the direct involvement of senior Indonesian army generals in the violence which swept East Timor in 1999.
Defence sources in Canberra have given details of how Australian electronic eavesdroppers intercepted secret messages between the Indonesian officers who ran a campaign of fear to deter the East Timorese from voting for But virtually none of the collected evidence, which could be vital to finding the masterminds responsible for crimes against humanity, has been shared with United Nations investigators.
This is because of concerns that Indonesia would adopt countermeasures to foil future interception operations by the Defence Signals Directorate.
Transcripts of the DSD intercepts revealed to the Herald show a covert chain of command down from the then President B.J. Habibie's co-ordinating minister for politics and security, General Feisal Tanjung, to army generals and colonels on the ground in East Timor.
It provides evidence for the first time that Tanjung, a career special forces and paratroop officer, used a network of similar minded officers in a campaign to avert a vote for independence in the United Nations-supervised ballot on August 30, 1999.
When this failed to their enormous surprise, a DSD intercept shows the officers then organised the forced deportation of one third of East Timor's population and the destruction of infrastructure, with the assistance of two other ministers in Habibie's cabinet the former generals A.M. Hendropriyono and Mohammad Yunus Yosfiah.
Three Indonesian army and police generals who were in charge of security for East Timor in 1999 are among 18 suspects whose trials begin in Jakarta today over four militia rampages in Liquica, Dili and Suai. But the generals who planned and directed the militia operation appear likely to escape indictment.
The leak of highly classified intelligence material is the first time raw DSD intercepts relating to a contemporary event have been disclosed. It reflects deep disquiet in defence circles that Canberra at first downplayed the high-level Indonesian military involvement with the militias blaming it on "rogue elements" and since then has not used it to help war crimes Intercepts in February 1999 show Jakarta had sent detachments of special forces, code-named Tribuana and Venus, to begin black operations in East Timor, and that a commander based in Bali, Major-General Mahidin Simbolon, was referring to a militia group as "his crew".
As the militia campaign geared up with massacres of independence supporters in April, the DSD picked up conversations in which the East Timor army commander, Colonel Tono Suratman, is supervising the notorious militia leader Eurico Guterres.
Other messages include the allocation of radio frequencies by the Indonesian military command in Jakarta to militia groups, and a general in Jakarta's military intelligence agency organising T-shirts for demonstrations against the United Nations mission supervising the ballot.
The intercepts show the key officer running the militia in East Timor, Major-General Zacky Anwar Makarim, was ready to assassinate Guterres if he changed sides after the vote.
One intercept indicates that just after the arrival on September 20 of the international security force led by Australia's Major-General Peter Cosgrove, the covert campaign chiefs had sent in hit squads of special forces troops, code-named Kiper-9, to target independence leaders and turncoats from the pro-Indonesian cause.
The unfinished story of accountability in East Timor hangs over moves by the United States and Australia to improve contacts with Indonesian military and security agencies to pursue their campaign against terrorism.
The retired general Hendropriyono, who as transmigration minister in 1999 helped set up the camps into which East Timorese deportees were driven, was recently made head of Indonesia's National Intelligence Body.
On his visit to Jakarta last month, the Prime Minister, John Howard, accepted an Indonesian proposal to step up intelligence exchanges with this

Anarchists hijack police protest
(13th March 2002. Reports from u75 boards, Indymedia and Guardian)
Anarchists turn up at Police protest
IN what has to be one of the most surreal protests of the year, police officers from across Britain gathered around Parliament to protest at reforms to the police service proposed by the home secretary, David Blunkett.
Banned from actually demonstrating in uniform or with placards, hundreds of men with skintight haircuts loitered around Westminster seeking more money. One figure dressed as John Bull and covered in Union Jacks displayed a sign "New Labour, the boys in Blues are sick of you."
The police brass band complete with plastic 'bobbie' helmets drafted in for the day were drowned out when an assortment of Globalisation, environmental and social justice campaigners turned up with a Samba band. As the media descended upon the activists, signs were displayed with "Remember the Miners" slogans and others highlighting oppressive policing of protests.
Great humour was shown by the anti-capitalist protesters who handed out leaflets saying, "We demand a zero hour week for the police to give them fair times for reading, leisure activities with their friends or perhaps their partners, time for giving vent to their frustrations by making love, and to play football with the local kids and for chats with elderly passers-by, with who they could discuss the meaning of freedom."
Even the cops found it funny, with Constable Phil Bennett, of Thames Valley police, saying he found the leaflets "hilarious" and that they were going to publish it in their next magazine.
Shouts of "You've had your protest, now go home" were shouted at the throngs of officers as a humourous reminder of what is heard from police at each demonstration. One seething officer from East London told undercurrents that he wasn't "allowed to bring a banner but the anarchists could, and that it wasn't fair."
  The Home secretary attempts at creating a new type of civilian police force has angered many in the force. Some activists called for officers to strike on Mayday and others displayed a banner saying 'Anarchy is Attractive'. A reference to a Lambeth Police Commander who stated the anarchist way of life attracted him.
Meanwhile Mr Blair PM,is still insisting that the majority of police officers agreed with his government. Someone has to we guess.

@_subject: Bob Blacks abolition of work. 
"...the cyberpunks Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner, have drawn on "The Abolition of Work" in sketching zero-work lifestyles which variously turn on technology.  In Islands in the Net, Sterling extrapolates from several anti-work stances: the "avant-garde job enrichment" (as Steele would say) of the laid-back Rhizome multinational; the selective post-punk high-tech of Singapore's Anti-Labour Party; and the post-agricultural guerrilla nomadism of Tuareg insurgents in Africa.  He incorporates a few of my phrases verbatim.  Shiner in Slam recounts an individual anti-work odyssey expressly indebted to several Loompanics books, including "a major inspiration for this novel, The Abolition of Work by Bob Black."  If I am skeptical about liberation through high-tech it mainly because the techies aren't even exploring the possibility, and if they don't, who will?  They are all worked up over nanotechnology, the as-yet-nonexistent technology of molecular mechanical manipulation -- that SF cliche, the matter transformer

@_subject: Terrorist parasite quotes Bob Black on anarchism. 
"...My own conception of anarchism, which I think is also that of the classical anarchists, is that the feasibility of anarchism does not depend upon angelic assumptions about human nature. Critics of the anarchists always accuse them of idealizing ordinary people, but thats not true. Anarchists have no use for notions of original sin, but usually they dont posit that people are much smarter or better than they actually are. Anarchists have produced plenty of saints and heroes, but anarchy does not require saints and heroes, although it welcomes them. The most plausible and reasonable of anarchists, such as Proudhon and Kropotkin, properly pointed to the very substantial extent to which even society as we experience it, as experienced by people as they now are, is anarchistic. Authority is always parasitic upon anarchy. Authority cannot do without anarchy, but anarchy can do without authority (if you dont think so, call yourself anything you like  except anarchist)..."FROM

Basa Andere
Rufus C. Camphausen
(Basque, "forest-woman") In Basque legend Basa Andere is said to be a beautiful woman, "perfectly shaped" for love and covered all over with soft, golden hair like a cat's. This Basque "wild lady" can usually be met near a sunlit stream in a forest, where she awaits the wanderer while combing the hair of her soft belly with a golden comb.  She will smile lovingly at the man, lie back with open legs, and offer him first a view of the beautiful moist flower between her thighs, and then entrance into her warm and fragrant body.  It is said that the pleasure of making love to a Basa Andere is so intense that a man will die from it at the height of his orgasm.  The dead are found with their backs arched in the agony of unimaginable pleasure.

Backbench rebellion on new ASIO law FROM By Michelle Grattan
Serious backbench concerns have delayed introduction of controversial legislation increasing the powers of the Australian Security Intelligence Coalition MPs have attacked proposals to hold people incommunicado for 48 hours without legal representation.
The backbench attorney general and justice committee met the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, on Monday.
Those worried about the provisions included committee chairman, Christopher Pyne, Senator Marise Payne, Petro Georgiou, Senator George Brandis, Sophie Panopoulos, and Bruce Baird.
No agreement was reached. Mr Williams said he would look at the issues further. He will meet the backbenchers again this morning.
A radical provision, contained in the terrorism legislation introduced to Parliament last night, that allows the attorney-general to ban an organisation likely to endanger security and make links with it illegal, also came under fire.
The backbench critics of the ASIO bill said its provisions were a serious diminution of rights.
Mr Williams replied that terrorism raised serious issues which required serious responses.
He said what the ASIO legislation was trying to do was to stop mass murderers.
But Mr Georgiou said the danger was that innocent people would be dragged in and they would have no legal representation.
Senator Brandis said the anti-terrorist measure allowing the banning of organisations reminded him of the unsuccessful attempt to ban the Communist Party in the 1950s.
Mr Williams reiterated to reporters that the ASIO legislation would still contain the provision to detain people for 48 hours.

The International Workingman's Association to which I assume you are referring (IWMA) was not constituted until the last half of the 19th century, and even then it was a blend of nationalist organizations (Garibaldi), Marxists (uh, Marx & Engels), social democrats, various radical republicans, and the anarchists under the leadership of your nom de Anarchism has a long history before this, and not merely thinkers with an anarchist streak. Godwin wrote "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", "Caleb Williams" and his other works in the last decades of the 18th century. The Enrages were fucking shit up on the streets of Paris in the last decade of the 18th century. Shelley wrote "The Masque of Anarchy" and other similar poems in the early 19th century. Proudhon wrote his theoretical works and coined the term "anarchist" decades before the International was founded. The International represents the first significant mass-based, self-consciously anarchist organization. But it hardly "conceived" anarchism, nor did anarchism die with the defeat of its grandchildren in the Spanish Civil War. It is alive and well and evolving along multiple trajectories - primitivist, insurrectionary, communist, green, syndicalist, individualist, and countless other approaches, all of which tackle pieces of the totality and organize to destroy it.

@_subject: Barcelona summit 
British protesters flock to summit
Police armed with tear gas as thousands prepare to descend on Barcelona
Paul Harris and Burhan Wazir Sunday March 10, 2002 The Observer
Thousands of British protesters have drawn up plans to descend upon a European summit in Spain this week amid fears of a repeat of riots in Genoa last year that saw one protester killed by police.
Tens of thousands of anti-globalisation activists are travelling to Barcelona for the meeting of European Union heads of state and government. The summit, on 15-16 March, will be the first such meeting since the summit in Genoa, which saw the worst rioting in western Europe for decades.
British protesters, ranging from hardcore anarchists to environmentalists, are travelling to the city. London-based Global Resistance is organising transport from Madrid to Barcelona. 'We expect a big turnout. We need to show people how powerful we can be,' said organiser Guy Taylor.
Police surveillance on suspected British troublemakers has been stepped up. Special Branch detectives have been monitoring the movements of known activists, using intelligence gathered in Genoa and during last year's May Day protests, which brought London's West End to a halt and caused several hundred thousand pounds of damage.
Spanish police are determined to prevent any breakdown in law and order and have focused on anarchist groups. Since Genoa, anarchist protests have been labelled potentially terrorist activities in the EU, according to security reports seen by The Observer.
One report, studying terrorist trends in Europe over the past 12 months, concluded: 'The possibility of a resurrection of the left-wing and anarchist terror groups is existent.' That raises the possibility that anarchist demonstrators arrested in Barcelona could be charged with terrorism, not public order, offences.
Security measures to protect the summit and the European leaders who will be in Barcelona are to be as strict as those in Genoa. More than 8,500 police will be on the city's streets, including 3,000 officers drafted in from other parts of Spain. Riot police will be armed with tear gas and plastic bullets as well as pistols with live ammunition.
Ambulance teams have been set up to deal with expected casualties and mobile 'police intervention units' will act as a mobile police force moving quickly to any area of the city if rioting breaks out. Police have been carrying out random identity checks in city squares chosen for demonstrations and have raided several squats.
A security zone is to be set up around the conference centre around the Avenida Diagonal and the Catalonia Palace of Congresses, where the summit is being held. Similar zones will be set up around the two main hotels used by delegations at the summit, the Juan Carlos and Princess Sofia.
University campuses will also be closed down and private cars banned from the zone from midday on Thursday to midday on Saturday. 'The situation is high risk. We know that and we prepared for it,' said a senior EU source.
The Observer has learnt that at least 1,000 protesters from 'Black Bloc' groups will be attending the protests. Made up mainly of extremist anarchists from Germany and eastern Europe, they will try to breach the security zone and enter the summit buildings. Unlike the vast majority of peaceful protesters, Black Bloc activists use violence to achieve their ends. Similar plans took place in Genoa but were stopped by the Italian police in pitched battles that trashed large areas of the city centre.
'It is inevitable that the Black Bloc will arrive in Barcelona to show their strength. Genoa descended into a free-for-all with heavy violence. And the Black Bloc has taken all the credit for that. Barcelona proves irresistible,' said Richard Green, a protester from Bristol who will travel to Barcelona.
Another British demonstrator, Andy Wallace, 31, is taking a coach to Barcelona this weekend. He expects violence from the Spanish authorities: 'I think protesters in Barcelona next weekend will expect the worst.'
Spanish officials have applied to the EU for permission to refuse entry to anyone suspected of coming to Barcelona to participate in unrest. Similar tactics were tried before Genoa, but failed to prevent large numbers of protesters entering Italy.
However, the clampdown has been condemned by human rights groups and protesters' organisations. In Barcelona, residents' groups have criticised the high-profile police presence and accused the city authorities of adopting a siege mentality. 'There is an alarmist climate being created by the police. It is one thing guaranteeing safety and another turning the city into a bunker, preventing to a large extent the freedom of movement of its citizens,' said a spokesman for the Federation of Neighbourhood Associations of Barcelona.
Spanish police have liaised with their Italian counterparts to try to avoid a repeat of the Genoa violence. They have prepared special fast-track court procedures which could see people sentenced within 12 to 72 hours of being picked up by the police.
Although European leaders, including Tony Blair, initially praised the hardline taken by police in Genoa, a picture later emerged of brutality and beatings. One Italian protester, 23-year-old Carlos Giuliani, was shot and One protester who will not be in Barcelona this week is Norman Blair, 38, the Briton who is taking legal action against the Italian government after being kidnapped and tortured by police in Genoa.

PNG mutiny spreads
March 12 2002(anniversary of the great sepoy mutiny)
A mutiny by disgruntled members of the Papua New Guinean defence force has spread to a second regional army barracks.
Troops at Igam Barracks in Lae declared support for the mutiny that began at the Moem Barracks in Wewak on the weekend, according to a report on the website of PNG's The National newspaper.
In Wewak about 50 soldiers burned down two buildings and stormed the Moem Barracks armoury in protest at government plans to downsize the military through retrenchments.
"We are not happy with the retrenchment package," a soldier speaking on behalf of the Igam barracks troops told The National.
"The retrenchment exercise was not our own decision. We have made our frustrations known through the chain of command, however, we have not received any answer.
"We will consider other options if our attempts to get a favourable answer to our demands are unsuccessful."
The soldiers are anxious over outstanding housing and hardship allowances and long service entitlements and believe they should be properly compensated in order to make a successful return to civilian life.
Lae is about 250km north of the capital Port Moresby, which remains calm with no signs of the dissent spreading to the military's headquarters.
Senior officers from the PNG defence force are expected to meet later today with the 50 or so troops who mutinied at Wewak barracks in the country's Defence Force commander Brigadier Peter Ilau described the situation at Wewak Barracks as quiet but tense and doubted the dissent would spread.
"I want to warn the soldiers that the actions taken by them thus far are completely unlawful, illegal and punishable with severe consequences," he told the National.
Ilau said the Moem incident was the result of failure by the unit commander and officers to regularly keep the soldiers informed about the government's retrenchment exercise.
"The other major units, commanding units and their officers have taken ownership of the exercise and they have made it their business to be part of it and this is what was lacking at Moem Barracks," he said.
Ilau said Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta had personally given him his full support to handle the situation despite the rebellious Moem soldiers' call for the commander to stand down.
Provincial police commander Leo Kabilo said soldiers remained inside Moem barracks and had not ventured out since the weekend.

@_subject: $4,320pounds reward for death of Bush. 
Make that 4,320 pounds,10 shillings.
We must hunt down and destroy all who support terrorism, including GW Bush! by Mark Thomas, New Statesman 11:04am Mon Mar 11 '02 (Modified on 5:08pm Mon Mar 11 '02)
A writer from the UK's New Statesman makes his "own contribution to the war on terrorism" by promising his "earnings to anyone who'll kill Bush" for his support of Colombiam terrorism.
A basic rule of life is: never cross a picket line, unless it is the police who are on strike. Then you have to, as a point of principle. Nor should it stop there. Why not volunteer to do a spot of patrolling, randomly photograph the striking officers and in general be sarcastic to them, along the lines of: "This your brazier is it, sir?" and "Got a receipt for it, have you?"
The police won't strike, obviously, but they have planned a demonstration in Whitehall, which all activists and trade unionists should attend. Not out of solidarity, but just to see the look of confusion on the cops' faces as they try to fight back the urge to baton-charge themselves and arrest their own ringleaders. If only the event could be stewarded by ex-miners and print workers . . .
In truth, the police demo will be full of journalists, bemused onlookers and unimaginative placards. Reality doesn't have the sense of justice and symmetry it should have. Reality is dull and often implemented with rapidly moving blunt instruments. Or company cheques made out to "The Republican Party of America".
For those on the receiving end of America's blunt instruments, the words "never cross a picket line" are not spoken glibly. A month ago, I wrote of the death threats received by trade unionists in Cali, Colombia, who, in a stand against corruption and privatisation, occupied the headquarters of the utility company Emcali. They knew there would be a price to pay for standing up to globalisation, and that the right-wing paramilitaries would exact it.
With sickening predictability, the murders have started.
On 11 February, Julio Galeano, a father of three and a member of the "Save Emcali" strike committee, was killed as he left his home. The assassin put a 9mm handgun under his lower left jaw and shot him. As his wife, Viviana, ran for her life, Julio was shot three more times in the face. He was murdered by the paramilitary United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC).
Last week, I met a group of Julio's friends, who told me about the rise of AUC activity and recruitment drives in the Siloe area, where Julio lived. The "paras" meet on the local football pitch to recruit unemployed young men. The starting pay is  a month, a good wage, but the biggest incentive to join the death squads is that, in the neighbouring area of Aqua Blanca, 150 young people have been murdered since August last year because they refused to join the AUC.
The AUC's leader, Carlos Castano, has said that the forces are 70 per cent funded by the cocaine trade. The US Drug Enforcement Agency named him as being involved in money-laundering and the trans-shipment of cocaine. Castano even boasted on his website ( [ that he had kidnapped and killed Aury Sara Marrugo, a regional president of the oil workers' union. Yet Castano has not even been questioned about this by the Colombians, nor targeted by the forces of the US war on drugs.
Castano's anti-democratic views and activities are not the only things he shares with President Bush. "We have always proclaimed that we are the defenders of business freedom and of the national and international industrial sectors," said Bush in 2000. That doesn't sound too surprising, does it? You wouldn't expect Bush to say any-thing else. But I have to admit, I lied. Bush didn't say those words. They are the words of Carlos Castano. The self-confessed murderer, drug-dealer and death-squad leader stands shoulder to shoulder with Bush on his trade liberalisation agenda.
Sometimes it is hard to tell which one is the murderer with the business agenda and which one is the businessman with the murderous agenda.
Bush has already overseen $2bn in military aid to Colombian brigades with links to the AUC, who share equipment, information and membership with the "paras". Now he plans to give $98m to the Colombian armed forces to protect Occidental Petroleum's Cano Limon oil pipeline. Once again, this money will go to those involved in the worst human rights abuses in the region. Once again, the money will help arm the murderers of trade unionists, human rights activists and peasants.
President Andres Pastrana's ending of talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and invasion of the FARC-held demilitarised zone (roughly the size of Switzerland) can only lead to further human rights abuses. As the FARC guerrillas move out of the area, so the "paras" will move in, and the peasants will start to pay the price that Julio paid.
Given that Osama Bin Laden has a price on his head and is wanted dead or alive for organising acts of terrorism, it seems only fair to offer a bounty to anyone who can kill George Bush. After all, he is helping to bankroll the AUC. So my contribution to the war against terrorism is to offer  my total earnings so far for writing in the New Statesman, to anyone who can bag Bush. You don't have to bring me his head or snack on his heart. Nothing weird, just kill him and send me your bank details c/o the New Statesman.
Having said that, if some would-be assassin wants to give me the option, I'd like him taken out with a lethal papier-mache weapon crafted from flour, water, dictionaries and Enron share certificates. However, these are the finer points of President Bush's demise.
I would obviously settle for him accidentally stabbing himself to death with the pin from his enamel US flag badge.

The International Day Against Police Brutality, March 15, 2002:
Inventory of local and international participation
Here is an inventory of activities, which are being organized here, and abroad in the context of the sixth International Day Against Police Brutality. One thing to emphasize: the participation in Quebec and in Canada has never been so large and diverse, which is very encouraging.
Please note that this list is very incomplete since we are waiting for more groups and details concerning certain activities and other information. An up-date of the inventory of participation in the International Day Against Police Brutality will be available as soon as possible. Also note that all the activities mentioned below are planned to take place during the day of March 15 2002, unless otherwise specified.
QUEBEC AND CANADA
In Montreal the International Day Against Police Brutality has given rise to more interest than ever. The Collective Opposed to Police Brutality is organizing a demonstration, which its starting point is Berri Square, at 5:00p.m. For more information on COBP and the International Day Against Police Brutality, take a look at the collective's web site at Different activists from different organizations will participate by giving speeches, such as an activist from Kabataang (which means "youth" in the Filipino language) from a group coming from the Filipino community from Ctte-des-Neiges neighbourhood. The Association pour la Solidariti Syndicale Itudiante-ASSI (Student Association of Solidarity and Syndicalism) will also takes part of the support for International Day Against Police Brutality and a speech will be made by one of its members. (To know more about the ASSI, visit their web site at: Also the hip-hop group Genocyde and the rapper Patrick Joseph will be performing to the participants at the demonstration. Dozens of people will be coming via bus from Drummondville to participate in COBP's demonstration
At the same time as COBP's demo, MAJ - Mouvement Action Justice (Justice Action Movement) will be holding a torch march which will go to the police station Centre-Opirationnel Sud - C-O Sud (South Operational Centre) to denounce the suspicious death of Michael Kibbe, in February 2001, at the exterior of C-O Sud.
Other activities that have taken place in Montreal earlier this month. On March 2, activists from the CLAC - Convergence des Luttes Anticapitalistes (Anti-Capitalist Convergence) and COBP organized a day of workshops against repression under the theme "Operation Solidarity" at the Comiti Social Centre-Sud. On March 9, the Montreal section of RASH (Red and Anarchists Skinheads) organized a benefit night for COBP at Cafi Chaos with Les Esclaves Salariis (ex-Provos), The Last Rocker and Class Assassins.
In Quebec City the local section of NEFAC (North Eastern Federation of Anarcho-Communists) are organizing a show with Protestars, les Ditraquis and Stiphane Robitaille, to take place at the Ichourie. In Sherbrooke a demonstration is being organized. In the region of Trois-Rivihres, at the Cap-au-Cafi, a show was also organized in support of the International Day Against Police Brutality, last March 9. At the College of Outaouais, there will be a presentation of films about police brutality.
In English Canada, activities are planned in four cities. In Calgary, Alberta, a demonstration against police brutality and harassment is organized by the Calgary Coalition for Social Justice in solidarity with and endorsed by the Alberta Coalition Against Poverty and the Latin American Community Association (LACA). The march will end in front of the Calgary Police Headquarters.
Moreover, we would like to add information available on the web site of LACA, which displeased so much the Calgary police that they threatened to sue them for slander, in particularly concerning the dossier on the case of Juan Melendez, savagely brutalized by the police on August 17, 2000. You can check it out at: In Winnipeg, Manitoba, a popular celebration will be organized, to celebrate the vast diversity of community resources and networks that exist that provide and support sectors of the population that pay the enormous price of realities in the capitalist economy. This event will include free food and animation, putting the accent on what we do instead of limiting ourselves to only to opposing police brutality.
In Toronto, Ontario the Freyheyt Collective from the NEFAC will be distributing leaflets in the working class neighbourhood of Parkdale. The Collective will hand out information on rights in situations of arrest as well as information on the International Day Against Police Brutality from an anarchist perspective on the police.
Finally, in Vancouver, British Columbia, an event on the theme of police harassment and brutality will take place at Black Star Cafe next March 18. Also the BC Latin American Congress will hold a discussion about a case of police violence against two Latino Youngsters in front of their mother. The complainants will attend the meeting. It will be held at 4184 Brant St.
In the United States, two anarchist federations are officially supporting March 15, 2002. The first of these is the Anarchist Black Cross (ABC) Federation, which works in support of prisoners, and which has reprinted the call for an International Day against Police Brutality in English and Spanish on the home page of its web site (
Secondly, there is the North American Federation of Anarcho-Communists (NEFAC), which includes in its ranks member groups and sympathizers in Quebec ( In Boston, NEFACs Sabate Anarchist Collective will be presenting a lecture and discussion evening at the Lucy Parsons Center featuring a former organizer of Boston Copwatch and an activist associated with the Criminal Justice Program.

In Brazil, there will be an event to discuss police brutality, which will include debates and a photo exhibit.
In New Zealand, a Maori benefit concert for Steven Wallace was held at the University of Victoria in Wellington on March 7th. Steven Wallace was shot four times and killed by constable Abbot on April 30th 2000, the police preventing bystanders from coming to his aid as he was bleeding to death on the sidewalk. The internal police investigation cleared the murdering cop of any wrongdoing and a private complaint filed by Steven's father was rejected by the court on February 22nd 2002.

"...Q: Many market-libertarians either ignore or whitewash the horrors of the Industrial Revolution. That's rather amusing, as the circumstances surrounding industrialization in England, where many thousands of people were driven off the land their families had lived on for centuries, would hardly seem to fulfill anyone's ideals of freedom. From across the political spectrum, what types of apologias or evasions have you encountered for the horrors of industrialism?
A: I know of no serious technology critics among market-libertarians. Even those who advocate Jeffersonian small-farmer ownership.

Malaysia's digital ID slow to take off
Pauline Jasudason in Kuala Lumpur
MARCH 11, 2002
THE Malaysian Government touts its new smart ID card with a litany of boastful slogans, like "highly secure", "single card, multiple solutions" and "incredible transformation".
But the vast majority of Malaysia's 23 million people are unaware of the new card  dubbed MyKad  or don't know how it functions.
Take, for example, driving license data stored in the card's microchip. The card is supposed to obviate the need for drivers to carry separate license and identification documents.
Someone needs to tell the cops. Local media have reported policemen fining motorists who whip out a MyKad instead of driver's license, because the officers don't have a scanner to read the card.
"This is still the two-year pilot stage," acknowledges Mohamad Ariffin Ismail, director of the Multipurpose Card Project. "We want to help Malaysians leap into the IT age. This card will be the tool."
About 1.2 million MyKads have been issued since the card's September launch. Eventually, they will replace the regular IDs required for all Malaysians once they reach age 12.
The Government expects MyKad to completely replace current IDs in five years.
A 32-kilobyte microchip embedded in the MyKad holds the name, address, ID number, digital thumb print and photograph of the owner, as well as driving licence data and passport information.
Officials say it will eventually contain medical information, facilitate e-cash transactions and enable users to conduct secure internet transactions.
The card contains open data  like the details on regular IDs  and restricted data that cannot be accessed without thumbprint verification.
Mr Mohamad takes pride in this south-east Asian nation being the first to introduce a multipurpose smart card. He downplays debate in the West that such a card can turn into Big Brother in your pocket.
"There must be a trade-off somewhere, you know, between freedom, and freedom to allow all these guys moving around with bombs," Mr Mohamad said, alluding to terrorist fears. "You want freedom. But, you also want security."

REVOLT IN SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, CHIAPAS, MIXICO ON EVENING OF 7TH MARCH 2002
Large crowds repel police, set police vehicles on fire, and loot supermarket and big shops. A carnival atmosphere prevails as crowds control the streets for over 3 hours. Later police enter area, fire tear gas and make a reported 50 arrests The conflict occurred in the area around the public market, a poor area where many indigenous people live and work, and followed a police operation against sellers of pirated merchandise. On the morning of 8 March police with riot gear cordon off an area around the public market.
This is an incomplete report written a few hours after the events from eye witness reports, and info in the local press and radio. More info hopefully to follow. Feel free to circulate but please remove e mail address.
A major revolt with thousands on the streets engulfed the area around the public market in San Cristobal de Las Casas on the evening of 7 March. Large crowds broke into at least 3 big stores, including a supermarket and department store. In a festive atmosphere men, women and children joyfully carted off large amounts of food, drink, clothes and furniture over a period of over 2 hours. Onlookers, including women with babies, elderly people and children watched with interest, and some shouted advice to the looters about the best route to take to avoid the police.
Two police vehicles were set on fire and burnt in the middle of the street. The crowd repulsed an attempt by the police to enter the area, hurling missiles. A shop was set alight and the fire was still burning at midnight.  From before 7pm till after 10pm thousands were on the streets, and the police seemed to have little or no presence an no control over the situation.
The conflict reportedly started at 6pm after a police operation to arrest sellers of pirated CDs etc.. Local newspaper La Foja reports that a police attempt to enter the area around this time was repulsed by the crowd throwing missiles.
By 7pm a police vehicle was ablaze in the street by the public market, hundreds, if not thousands were in the streets and police were not to be seen. Around 8pm missiles were seen being hurled, and slightly later a line of riot police were formed across the road behind Santo Domingo church.
Around 8pm the crowd began to break into large shops by the market, breaking plate glass windows and tearing off iron grilles on the entrances. Tela de Mexico, Alamanecenes Grandes, and then the supermarket which is opposite the last named, on a side street by the market, were all sacked. Around the same time another fire was burning in the street by the market, reportedly a second police car ablaze.
Large crowds of men, women and children carried off bags and boxes of food and groceries, sacks of rice or beans, bottles of wine and spirits, mattresses, sofas and much more. Eye witnesses reported a joyful and excited atmosphere. There were few vehicles in the area, but taxis and cars that strayed into the area were allowed to pass unhindered.
Around 10.15pm a large fire was seen burning near the market, reportedly a shop. Around 10.- 10.30pm police, some armed and some with riot shields and helmets, entered the area, charged the crowd and made arrests. According to local radio 50 men, women and children were arrested. La Foca paper reports the use of ?an excessive use of force? by the police when making arrests. Police fired tear gas on more than one occasion, and tear gas swept down nearby streets, causing discomfort to inhabitants of houses. Fire fighters entered the area to combat the fires.
By 11.30 pm police appeared to have regained control of the situation, though there were still crowds in the street, the shop continued to burn and there were remnants of a fire in the street. Local radio reports 6 police received hospital treatment. It is not known how many civilians were injured by the police violence.
Reports in the media that some of the crowd applauded the entry of the police into the area were not confirmed by eye witnesses who reported instead mass participation in looting, and many onlookers observing without any worries. The reactions observed to the arrival of the police were either resistance or flight.
At 9am the next morning, 8 March, an area around the public market was cordoned off by police with riot gear who were preventing entry by the public.
More news may follow, and there may be reports on Indymedia Chiapas (this report is not however from Indymedia Chiapas or any organization)
Note San Cristobal de Las Casas in Chiapas, southern Mexico has a population of over 130,000, many of whom live in poverty, many lack basic services such as electricity, piped water and drainage in their houses. A large proportion of the population are indigenous people, the majority Tzotziles, and suffer racist discrimination.

@_subject: Low intensity warfare. 
Even with the US military machine focused on the Middle East, we
can't afford to forget about the US government's imperialist war in
Colombia. Bush's latest military budget contains $98 million to
specifically support Colombian soldiers protecting the
Cano-Limon pipeline in Colombia that rebels rendered inoperative
throughout most of 2001. More profits for his oil buddies!
Plan Colombia is a good example of the practice of Low Intensity
Warfare and is important for clarifying our understanding of U.S.
foreign policy in conflicted areas around the world. The U.S.
government, in the service of an international capitalist system,
seeks to send one message to the entire world, best exemplified in
the acronym TINA: "There Is No Alternative".
No alternative, that is, to the current trend of investors and
corporations to dominate the entire planet. They do this under the
guise of a neo-liberal philosophy of "free trade", designed to bring
about the integration and globalization of the world's economy. We
are witnessing the end of an historical epoch dominated by the
power of Nation States and replacing it with the international
Corporate State.
Low Intensity Warfare has a history dating back at least to the Boer
Wars in South Africa, but the U.S. did much to perfect this warfare
in the jungles of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam
War. Low Intensity Warfare is a response to guerilla warfare, which
many third world people used in attempts to overthrow colonial
domination by foreign forces.
To be successful, national liberation guerilla fighters first had to win
the hearts and minds of the local people. This is because
insurgency movements, rely on the ability to strike out at the enemy
and then quickly vanish back into the general population.
To gain the confidence of the locals, the insurgents would be active
in local politics and support programs and institutions that would
provide services in areas like health and education or organizing
labor unions. Many guerilla fighters would also work very hard to
educated their neighbors, which spread literacy throughout the third
world. In guerilla warfare the combatants are often described as fish
and the indigenous population are the water in a stream, the fish are
always able to blend in with their natural environment.
Low Intensity Warfare seeks to dry up the stream.
Counter-insurgency often consists of the U.S. and other first world
governments supplying large quantities of arms, training and money
to the military forces of countries like Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala and now Colombia, under the cover of defending the
government and "democracy" from rebel forces. These
governments and military forces are only looking after the interests
of the very small sector of the population who control the wealth and
The US likes to maintain dictatorial governments who might be
brutal to their people but supply US companies with cheap labor and
other favors. If the guerrillas release themselves from this colonial
arrangement, the American corporations could lose huge profits.
Low Intensity Warfare defends the interests of the ruling classes
and capitalist institutions of these countries.
Counter insurgents do not seek to actually combat the armed
insurgents; their war targets the bases of support in the civilian
population. Thus, in the Nicaraguan conflict, the Contra army rarely
engaged the Sandinista army. Their targets were the collective
farms, the rural school system, the medical clinics, the mayors and
politicians, doctors, nurses, teachers, social workers, labor union
organizers or any village or group of people whom the military
intelligence suspected of supporting the Sandinistas.
Frequently this kind of warfare leads to massacres of large
numbers of civilians to terrorize them and prevent them from
supporting the guerrillas. Low Intensity Warfare includes torture and
murder of infants and children in front of their parents, decapitation,
mutilation, burning alive, mass rape of women and children, etc.
Many of the more well-known and brutal slaughters in places like
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala were carried out by military
forces trained in the United States in the arts of torture, murder and
During the Nicaraguan conflict the CIA was caught mining a harbor.
The captured U.S. agents carried some manuals written for the
Contra army and its civilian death squads by the U.S. military.
These manuals instructed the U.S. supported terrorists on how to
select, target, and assassinate perceived supporters of the
Sandinista government.
Reports of slaughters and massacres of civilian populations by
military forces supplied, trained and supported with U.S. taxpayers'
money has embarrassed the U.S. military and government. A
convenient way to avoid this kind of embarrassment is to hire
mercenaries to carry out Low Intensity Warfare. U.S. taxpayers'
money is spent to arm and finance death squads and foreign militias
who oppose their ruling government which also is uncooperative
with the U.S. government. This allows for the appearance that the
U.S. military is not directly involved in civilian massacres.
It is important to remember that Low Intensity Warfare is not really
aimed at a military victory against its opponents. While the rebel
forces fighting in Columbia may not fit the profile of a Liberation
Army they do pose an alternative to the consolidation of the power
and wealth of the worlds power elite under the programs of
neoliberalism and Globalization. What the Low Intensity Warfare of
Plan Colombia seeks is to bring the civilian and indigenous
populations to their knees and force them to accept capitalism's
final solution, globalization of the world economy and the
dictatorship of the corporate state.
This capitalist dictatorship will be shrouded in what amounts to a
military "democracy". This form of democracy is like the U.S., where
the rich and powerful control the political parties and superstructure
with their wealth and power. This control guarantees the outcome
elections and insures that their interests will dominate the
government agenda.
In the client states, however, the military and the death squads are
always not far in the background in the event some real alternative
might come to power either through elections or by other means.
Even the U.S. uses these tactics with government programs like
COINTELPRO, which results in military actions against students,
infiltration and subversion of groups like the Black Panthers and
assassination of their leaders.
In Chile the U.S. sponsored the overthrow of the freely elected
government of Salvador Allende. Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, referred to this military coup and the massacres that
accompanied the ascension to power of the Pinochet dictatorship
as "the re-establishment of democracy in Chile."
The message behind the Plan Colombia and Low Intensity Warfare
to the Colombian people is "There Is NO Alternative," TINA. No
alternative to the poverty, no alternative to military democracy, no
alternative to death squads, no alternative but submission to the
needs of global capitalism; the World Bank, the IMF and the World
Trade Organization. You must serve these interests and the
interests of the Corporate State, allow them to steal your countries
natural resources, destroy its environment, do their bidding and
work as good wage slaves for less than subsistence wages. You will
submit to the destruction of your culture, and allow yourself to be
indoctrinated by the mass media into being a mindless consumer,
happy to be forever entertained, passive and submissive, keeping
your mouth shut and voting when told to. You will forget any notions
you may have about the state having any responsibility for the
welfare of those it governs. You will do all this or you and your
family, will never live a day of your lives free of fear and in peace.
THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO PLAN COLOMBIA!
Or perhaps there is, but that depends on what the world's exploited
and impoverished people, its wage slaves, students, you and I, and
others decide to do to resist TINA, the culture of the Spectacle and
the capitalist state.

...in 1986, Nicaragua took the US to the International Court of Justice to sue for damages. The court ruled the US action illegal, describing it as terrorist and awarding $16 billion in compensation to be paid by the US to Nicaragua. Predictably, not a cent was ever seen by Nicaragua. The US completely ignored the ruling, saying the court didnt have jurisdiction on the matter. On November 12, 1978, the Sandinista government then introduced a resolution in the UN General Assembly stating the Need for US compliance with the ruling by the International Court of Justice concerning military and paramilitary activities against Nicaragua. The resolution was adopted 94 votes to 2, the US and Israel against. Ronald Reagan, when asked about the resolution against his policies in Nicaragua, calmly replied, It didnt interrupt my breakfast. This money would have been enough to completely lift Nicaragua out of debt and poverty. Even today, the $16 billion could pay-off Nicaraguas debt three times over. Unfazed, the Sandinistas persisted and introduced another resolution in the General Assembly, attempting and succeeding in shaming the US internationally.

@_subject: Who is Chompsky 
When the lunar right is mainstream I guess some think Chomp is rad,lets look a little closer.(Thanks zerzen)
(START)Noam Chomsky is probably the most well-known American anarchist, somewhat curious given the fact that he is a liberal-leftist politically, and downright reactionary in his academic specialty, linguistic theory. Chomsky is also, by all accounts, a generous, sincere, tireless activist -- which does not, unfortunately, ensure his thinking has liberatory value.
Reading through his many books and interviews, one looks in vain for the anarchist, or for any thorough critique. When asked point-blank, "Are governments inherently bad?" his reply (28 January 1988) is no. He is critical of government policies, not government itself, motivated by his "duty as a citizen." The constant refrain in his work is a plea for democracy: "real democracy," "real participation," "active involvement," and the like.
His goal is for "a significant degree of democratization," not the replacement of political rule by a condition of no rule called anarchy. Hardly surprising, then, that his personal practice consists of reformist, issues-oriented efforts like symbolic tax resistance and ACLU membership. Instead of a critique of capital, its forms, dynamics, etc., Chomsky calls (1992) for "social control over investment. That's a social revolution." What a ridiculous assertion.
His focus, almost exclusively, has been on U.S. foreign policy, a narrowness that would exert a conservative influence even for a radical thinker. If urging increased involvement in politics goes against the potentially subversive tide toward less and less involvement, Chomsky's emphasis on statecraft itself gravitates toward acceptance of states. And completely ignoring key areas (such as nature and women, to mention only two), makes him less relevant still.
In terms of inter-government relations, the specifics are likewise disappointing. A principle interest here is the Middle East, and we see anything but an anarchist or anti-authoritarian analysis. He has consistently argued (in books like The Fateful Triangle, 1983) for a two-state solution to the Palestinian question. A characteristic formulation: "Israel within its internationally recognized borders would be accorded the rights of any state in the international system, no more, no less." Such positions fit right into the electoral racket and all it legitimizes. Along these lines, he singled out (Voices of Dissent, 1992) the centrist Salvadoran politician Ruben Zamora when asked who he most Chomsky has long complained that the present system and its lap- dog media have done their best, despite his many books in print, to marginalize and suppress his perspective. More than a little ironic, then, that he has done his best to contribute to the much greater marginalization of the anarchist perspective. He has figured in countless ads and testimonials for the likes of The Nation, In These Times, and Z Magazine, but has never mentioned Anarchy, Fifth Estate, or other anti-authoritarian publications. Uncritically championing the liberal-left media while totally ignoring our own media can hardly be an accident or and oversight. In fact, I exchanged a couple of letters with him in 1982 over this very point (copies available from me). He gave a rather pro-left, non-sequitur response and has gone right on keeping his public back turned against any anarchist point of view.
Chomsky's newest book of interviews, Class Warfare, is promoted in the liberal-left media as "accessible new thinking on the Republican Revolution." It supposedly provides the answers to such questions as "Why, as a supporter of anarchist ideals, he is in favor of strengthening the federal government." The real answer, painfully obvious, is that he is not an anarchist at all.

FROM War by Assassination
John Filiss
The capacity for warfare is both the ultimate justification and great curse
of the state. And the problem of both war and the state is, sadly, one of
the deepest tragedies of the human condition.
The following is one possible solution to the problem.
War as it has been played out throughout so much of history and into the
present day accepts a basic authoritarian assumption that quite possibly
accounts for almost the entire horror of warfare. That assumption is that a
nation's leadership, and by implication the individuals who are
instrumental in enacting a state of war, should be immune from the fray.
The idea that warfare should consist of a clashing of arms between soldiers
and often the populations of the afflicted countries is accepted without
question, when in truth the first front of warfare should be against the
perpetrators of war themselves...its leaders, architects, and profiteers.
If Nation A declares war on Nation B, then the most astute response on the
part of the population of Nation B is to target the leadership of Nation A,
given their initiative in creating a state of war. Not only is this the
most direct and least tragic solution, it is hard to imagine a better
deterrent to war than the knowledge that those who perpetrate it will be
targeted in proportion to their culpability.
The rub in the above example is that while the above actions on the part of
Nation B may be the wisest for the general population, they are not
necessarily the best solution for the heads of state of Nation B, since
Nation A will likely retaliate by trying to target the Nation B leadership
as well. Thus a certain "king's agreement" of mutual protection, one where
the leadership is not directly targeted, has reigned through so much of
history. Exceptions in the modern world are mostly confined to the
conclusions of full-scale wars, where one country is largely at the mercy
of the other and hence not deemed a threat in its ability to respond in
kind 1; or in cases where a nation's government is already inculcated in
activities that could be perceived as evoking an assassination threat
against a nation's head of state, hence abrogating the king's agreement.
It is important to note, I think, that I am using the term "king's
agreement" to describe not so much a conscious awareness of the mechanism
described, but a feature of conditioning by authority that applies to all
of us in accepting the status quo of war.
What is fascinating is that, while we more or less accept the true nature
of war, it is not the image that is usually sold to us in the West as
justification. What both the government and the media commonly do is focus
upon particular personalities, usually the active or titular head of the
opposing nation, as malefactor and cause for the current aggression. There
is often a backdrop of a hostile governing elite, e.g., Taliban, Politburo,
etc., that is painted in to complete the picture, but animosity towards
entire populations is a relatively minor theme, at least in the West. 2
The media and government don't focus on leadership personalities primarily
as an exercise in deception, but in response to what is ultimately a
humanitarian impulse, even for themselves. Few people really want to focus
on mass slaughter of the enemy population as the goal of warfare...rather,
they want a limited number of specific culprits who can be blamed for the
animosity. Unfortunately, even the best-intentioned modes of contemporary
warfare fail to show the same extreme prejudice in choice of targets. I
think we can do better. A system of war by assassination effectively rips
the facade off of war in that you are actually fighting the perceived
enemy, and not those under the enemy's rule.
One of the most important features of war by assassination is its
portability to the needs of stateless and even cashless societies. The
issue of war by hostile states has been perhaps the hardest conundrum for
primitive societies, as well as proposed anarchist societies. 3 While not
necessarily a panacea for all the problems these societies might face on
this front, it is far more credible an approach in facing off against the
state than using conventional warfare, and much more appealing than
guerilla warfare. A more decentralized society may even have a slight
advantage in implementing this against a state, as the latter is relatively
more dependent on a particular leadership.
What might a system of war by assassination look like?
7       For most nations, it would involve some kind of bounty system,
usually involving the payout of very large sums of money (although still
small relative to the costs of traditional modes of warfare). The sums of
money would have to be substantive to warrant the effort...they should in
fact be representative of the value of that individual's death to the
paying nation. Moreover, there should be ransoms of varying amounts placed
on multiple key individuals within the target government or terrorist
organization. Not only can this potentially cut a broad swathe through the
target's leadership, which will often be necessary anyway, but it
considerably increases the likelihood that any private mercenary efforts
can recoup capital investments and, naturally, be well rewarded for the
considerable risk of their undertaking.
7       In cashless societies, the reward may involve goods like land, or
such intangibles as being a national hero and the gratitude of the peoples
rescued from the horrors of invasion. While this may sound ineffectual in
comparison with the cash bounty system described above, cashless societies
are generally far smaller in population and land area than are societies
utilizing some form of cash. Hence, they tend to be much less valuable to
an aggressor nation. 7     4 This reduced value can balance out their
reduced capacity to generate a thorough and effective response. And of
course, idealism and the desire to effectively protect ones homeland for
invasion are other relevant factors.
7       The existence of special forces to implement assassination policies
as needed. These forces can be either governmental or private or both.
Private mercenary groups that would implement specific assassination
policies can be funded as necessary by speculators.
7       A guarantee of safe haven for individuals who implement
assassination policies. This can involve disappearance via identity changes
similar to those performed by the United State's Witness Protection
Program, and relocation to parts of the country or the world that would
afford them minimum risk of exposure.
7       In the event of death while successfully implementing assassination
policies, allowance should be made for the bounty to be paid to the
assassin's family or designated beneficiaries.
It is not the author's intent to emphasize a particular approach to warfare
as an adjunct to conventional warfare or warfare by any other means, but to
elucidate a method that effectively targets the individuals concerned with
creating war, thus giving them a powerful incentive to avoid war, including
war assassination, altogether. In upping the ante by making the act of war
more personal for those involved in its initiation and maintenance, it
makes the use of diplomacy and a more considered foreign policy far more
appealing to a country's leadership. At its best, the acceptance of war by
assassination is a powerful check on the growth and depredations of
governments. At its worst, it is a sometimes useful tool to avoiding the
needless deaths of innocents, i.e., "collateral damage," when nations clash.
1. And even these instances usually involve some form of trial, e.g., those
at Nuremburg following WWII.
2. It is, however, much more common in wars with a religious or ethnic
basis, i.e., where the differences between cultures can't be credibly
ascribed to a particular leadership. Conflicts of this nature may be more
resistant to resolution by an assassination approach, but the open adoption
of this method as a valid means of warfare does gives the leadership a
powerful incentive to forestall the breakout of hostilities.
3. To give but one example, in The Machinery of Freedom, anarcho-capitalist
David Friedman titles the relevant chapter "National Defense: The Hard
Problem" to denote the very real difficulties the issue of war poses for an
anarchist society, and writes "I would not try to abolish that last vestige
of government" should his proposals for defending an anarchist society
against a hostile state be inadequate.
4. However, this safeguard can be overridden if any particularly valuable
resource is found on the land of a primitive society that does not wish to
capitalize on it, or in any small society occupying an area that attains a
crucial strategic importance to much greater powers.

@_subject: Declan to be fingerprinted? 
The Honorable Richard M. Daley
121 N. LaSalle St.
Chicago, IL 60602
March 4, 2002
Dear Mr. Daley:
It is with great concern that the Chicago Headline Club, the local professional chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, learned of the Chicago Police Department's decision to change regulations governing press credentials.
The department plans to enforce a city code provision (Chapter 4-328 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago) that has been on the books for decades but never has been enforced. Had the Headline Club known of the code's existence, we would have asked for a review immediately. We do so now.
After conducting research and consulting with our attorney, Jon A. Duncan, the Headline Club has a series of concerns:
1) In other jurisdictions, most recently Omaha, Neb., in November 2001, police dropped plans to fingerprint reporters for background checks. The department decided that doing so amounted to "licensing of the news media," according to the Reporters' Committee for the Freedom of the Press. Background checks are not mentioned in the Chicago ordinance, but Police News Affairs personnel have told Headline Club officials that such checks would be "likely," with the possibility that credentials could be denied. We question the constitutionality of such undertakings.
2) Fingerprinting and possible background checks constitute a possible invasion of privacy.
3) We are neither employees nor contractors of the government, but act independently to report and critique the government for the public's benefit. The regulations could have a chilling effect on our work.
4) The ordinance is clearly dated. It makes no mention of television, cable or online journalism. It instead allows for "news-reel" photographers, a breed extinct for at least 40 years.
5) The ordinance makes no provision for part-time or freelance journalists.
While the Headline Club supports the idea of accrediting the media, we question the City of Chicago's right to determine who is a journalist.
We support the broadest possible access for those who are employed full or We urge you to table the Police Department's plans until this ordinance is revised. We believe that the Superintendent of Police lacks the legal authority to unilaterally establish rules and procedures for the issuance of media credentials. We ask you to appoint a five-member "advisory committee on news credentials" as outlined by Section 040. The ordinance states that this committee shall consist of three media representatives, one each from radio, newspapers and press associations (We believe television and online news organizations should be included as well). The ordinance also states that rules and procedures regarding press credentials must be proposed by the committee -- of which the Superintendent is only one member. The committee should review the ordinance and determine how it can be enforced in ways acceptable both to journalism organizations and to the Chicago Police Department.
We urge you to act quickly because current press credentials are due to expire in March. We would appreciate the chance to sit down with you, or your designated representatives, at your earliest convenience to discuss our concerns.

Ersteller: anarchy Regarding the monthly anarchist newspaper "DIADROMI ELEFTHERIAS" ("ROUTE FOR FREEDOM"). It s usual in every new publication to have an editorial explaining the reasons of that effort. The questions are many! WHY ANOTHER ANARCHIST NEWSPAPER? WHY NOW? HOW? WHICH ARE THE ASPIRATIONS? The answers are also many and multi-form! Answers which, sometimes, start from an "underground" -others call it "inner"- feeling for apology or with an obvious intention for a "political" thesis while, in other times, include extensive analysis trying to give explanations. Now, we, the circle of editors, could just say that that s the way we like it and we don t have to give any explanations to anybody! Simple and easy answer!! It also includes a characteristic bully tone -which we fancy a lot- and some might like and others might not. Anyway, without feeling that a new publication puts those who participate in it in a -constant or temporary- state of "bewildered" or "mechanic" explanations, we believe however that some things must be said. First of all, during this period of time, it is a fact that thereisn t a single anarchist newspaper to be distributed in all the Greek territory. This has as a result to make more difficult the contact with anarchist views and practice and to have insufficient information about the social "action" of all companions, and in general of people who act or want to take initiatives in other areas. The "DIADROMI ELEFTHERIAS" makes the attempt to contribute to that direction, baring in mind the (positive and negative) experience from similar publications during the 80 s and the 90 s. An attempt like that is part of a "wider" but also "narrower" route. Some carry with us and share the experience of publishing by groups or individuals. This experience we wish to combine all together with the enthusiasm and the will of all companions united with a large dose of "companionship". We don t start from scratch and we don t pretend to learn everything now. However, we do have a lot to learn as well as to contribute -as much as we can- to the expansion of anarchist views and practice. The participation of groups and individuals in the circle of editors of the "DIADROMI ELEFTHERIAS" doesn t mean that the groups will be abolished or merged into it nor that the individuals will vanish inside a wider collectivity. In this circle of editors we don t function by majority but by the mutually acceptable concepts and views and of course by the anarchist consent. Our target is to contribute to the creation of other anarchist groups which will take action in every place within the Greek territory. We wish the continuation of other publications by anarchist collectivities and their expansion. We don t antagonize publications which already exist and we will not transform the "DIADROMI ELEFTHERIAS" into a battlefield between groups and individuals. In the contrary we will mainly try to make known and enhance the views and practice which we consider that may contribute essentially to the social and individual liberation from the bonds of whatever form of power. The contribution of each one of us separately and all together in the information, analysis and making known of the social facts and conditions through the pages of the "DIADROMI ELEFTHERIAS" doesn t intend to make it into an organ of "expression" of a certain ideology. Such intentions and cumulative logic as it has already been proven can lead to the castrating of the expression of different views and practices by companions. Without wanting to enter into political proceedings and ideological analysis, we must say that we wish that this publication will be a route to freedom, a contribution to facing the rulers who attack nowadays all humanity fiercely. It is obvious to everyone that the more and more "upgraded" attack causes bigger and bigger harm on earth and humanity, while the expansion of their obscurantist plans, enforces the intensification of the oppression and exploitation of the people. Last but not least, we wish to say that this periodic publishing is a responsibility that can be based on the assiduity, the enthusiasm, the creativity and the constant effort of the companions but requires apart from us (the circle of editors) the solidarity and support with texts, information, comics, photographs, collaborations but also requires financial support. We wish and can transform the joy of creativity into destruction of the enemies of freedom.

Inside SchNEWS Emily Apple, a die-hard anti-capitalist non-stop direct action activist is being sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court next Wednesday (13). Emily and a friend handcuffed themselves to a docklands light railway train during protests against the Defence Systems Exhibition International last September (see SchNEWS 322) The 'exhibition' was Europes' biggest arms fair, catering for dictators and oppressive regimes throughout the world, selling landmines hawkjets, cluster bombs, rocket launchers, anti-ballistic missiles, you name it. The action stopped delegates on the train - literally in their tracks - from reaching the place. Her friend has been acquitted but Emily was convicted and now faces up to two years in prison, with the judge during the trail declaring that 'Society needs a break' from Emily. People are meeting for a breakfast with her in the park in the grounds of the court on: Wednesday March 13th Snaresbrook Crown Court, 75 Hollybush Hill, E11 (nearest tube Snaresbrook) at 9am. Tel 07789 528 043 * Also at the infamous arms fair a WOMBLE (those with the white overalls, padding and helmets) who was acting as a medic, was found not guilty of "using threatening words and behaviour" after he was nicked for the crime of trying to help someone who had been assaulted by the cops. The case provides an important precedent as the judge didn't accept the cops' claims that people wearing padding and white suits were there to be violent (unlike the non-violent people down the road busy selling weapons to each other) He also clearly sided with the defence after asking if he'd been wearing anything to identify him as a medic.

WAKE UP! WAKE UP! IT'S YER OILY RAG
Published in Brighton by Justice? - Brighton's Direct Action collective
ISSUE 345, March 8th, 2002
"If they are moving toward a violent solution, encouraging the military
toward violence, then they are playing with fire. The business sector
continues to criticise us. So why don't they do something to help this
country, like bringing back the $120 billion they keep in banks
- Tarek William Saab, Head of Venezuela's Foreign Policy Committee.
Three years ago Chavez was elected president of the fourth largest oil
producer in the world. On a tide of public support he won with the
biggest majority in four decades. The population of Venezuela were eager
for drastic change. They wanted a government that would rid them of
corruption and redirect the country's oil wealth from the pockets of
multinationals and towards the poor of Venezuela. In Venezuela 80 per
cent of a population of 24 million live in poverty.
Chavez set about changing the Constitution. Out went the prescribed
Washington model of elections and political parties, and in came a
participatory democracy with an emphasis on popular assemblies, social
movements and continuous referendums. As a result Venezuela's new
constitution now includes guarantees for indigenous, and women's rights,
free healthcare and education up to university level.
To reduce corruption Chavez restructured the courts and the legal system.
In a country where the prisons are amongst the most dilapidated and
dangerous in the world he met with prisoners and convinced them to hand
over their weapons while promising to look at the prison conditions and
the injustices of their sentences.
He also introduced two new laws that have brought him to the edge of his
demise and the country to the brink of a right-wing coup. Firstly, he
increased the tax paid on oil exports from 16 to 30 per cent and passed a
new energy law that requires 51 per cent government participation in all
oil ventures.
Secondly he introduced a land reform bill. The bill makes it possible for
the government to take land that has remained unproductive for 2 years
and re-distribute it to the poor. Within the law there is a provision
that extends credit to any private farmer who wants to make his land
productive rather than lose it. The bill is broad and does not
differentiate between farm, private and church land.
These two laws have prompted small but powerful sections from the unions,
middle class, rich, media, high ranking military officers and the
Catholic Church inside Venezuela to call for Chavez's resignation. In the
words of investigative journalist Greg Palast "the Church says the meek
will inherit the earth, but not while they are alive."
The right-wing opposition are using tactics similar to those used to oust
Salvador Allende in Chile during the early 1970s. The rich are being used
to create a feeling of chaos and paint a picture of Chavez as the
'dictator'. The military will then be encouraged to mount a coup
seemingly for the sake of the country.
NO MORE MR NICE GUY
Criticisms of Chavez's reforms outside of Venezuela have come from
financial institutions, governments, and the CIA. The IMF is even willing
to bankroll an interim government according to James Petras, professor at
the State University of New York. He believes the IMF and other financial
institutions are creating an economic crisis to oust Chavez. He says,
"There is no economic crisis. The economic problems facing Chavez have
always been there; they are problems that Chavez inherited. Venezuela is
an oil rich country that pays its debts and follows IMF guidelines etc."
George Tenent, head of the CIA and Colin Powell, US Secretary of State
have both been critical of Chavez. They claim that he is undercutting
American foreign policy by opposing US counter-narcotics aid to Colombia,
providing oil to Cuba and giving political support to guerrillas and
anti-government forces in neighbouring Colombia.
While Chavez has a long history of 'irritating' the US by attacking its
foreign policy he has been careful not to allow himself to become
involved in the civil war in Colombia. Chavez declared Venezuela neutral
and has helped in the release of hostages from the FARC (Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia) and helped the Colombian government during the
peace talks.
Chavez has a vision for a new world order "Rather than accepting the
imposition of models and economic policies, what we should do is march in
the direction of a system of international relations based on equality
and mutual respect" he says.
Sounds like there's a leader who's not prepared to sell his people up the
river and go along with what neo-liberalism forces on his country, for a
change. When four high ranking army officers called for him to be
overthrown, each one was interviewed by a joint civilian and military
team and released the next day. Imagine if that had happen here or in the
US - the officers would have been charged with treason and thrown in
James Petras, believes that "Chavez is an extremely moderate politician
who is being hammered for not allowing drug-surveillance flights over
Venezuela, being opposed to Plan Colombia (SchNEWS 273) and working with
Perhaps the most important figure in the foreign-sponsored
destabilisation campaign is Alfredo Peqa, the Mayor of Caracas and critic
of Chavez. Peqa has been visiting Washington recently meeting with the
World Bank and the state department and is being groomed to replace
The irony of all this is that the backer of the coming coup, the US, is
under the administration of a president who stole the presidency in a
coup d'etat. According to Greg Palast "No one wants to be in the same
room as President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela these days, much less stand
next to him. He is a dead man walking. It's not so much a case of if he
gets assassinated it's just a matter of when".

New rules governing the work of the Defence Signals Directorate were quietly introduced during last year's election campaign by the outgoing defence minister, Peter Reith.
The old rules explicitly prohibited the deliberate interception of communications between Australians in Australia - but the new rules, and the legislation under which they are made, do not.
Further, the new rules allow the DSD to report to the Government on Australians if their activities affect national security, foreign relations and even the country's economic wellbeing. Previously, DSD was only allowed to report on Australians where their activities involved threats to a person's safety or involvement in serious crime. MORE

A man who claimed to have gathered intelligence for an alleged terrorist organisation which resulted in the murder of a policeman will be allowed to remain in Australia for the time being.
The High Court yesterday found 3-2 in favour of Darjit Singh after the Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, contested a Federal Court decision that had found the Administrative Appeals Tribunal erred in law in saying Mr Singh had no right to apply to be accepted as a refugee in that it appeared he had committed a "serious non-political crime". Mr Singh's case will go back to the tribunal for reconsideration.
Mr Singh admits to having worked for the Khalistan Liberation Force.
He said he fled India because the police were arresting members of the group, which wants establishment of an independent Sikh state. He has been on a bridging visa since entering Australia in 1996.
Justice Murray Gleeson found in his part of the judgement that Mr Singh said he joined the group in 1984 after he claimed his family's business and property were destroyed by "Hindu mobs encouraged by the Indian Government".
He had given the group information about the movements of a police officer who had tortured one of its members. The group subsequently killed the officer.
Justice Ian Callinan found it could be concluded Mr Singh was at least an accessory to the murder of the policeman.

Washington (CNSNews.com) - Commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Shanghai communique that called for a betterment of relations between the United States and China, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said Tuesday he doesn't consider China a communist nation.
"I don't think China is a communist country in the sense of Soviet communism," said Kissinger. "It has institutions that we consider different and in many ways incompatible with our notions of domestic institutions. But it also clear, that the China 10 years from now, after the huge changes which it has already undergone will be far different from the China of today."
The former secretary of state also warned against conflicts between the U.S. and China, saying the two nations "have nothing to gain by confrontation with each other. History did not say that there will be only one superpower forever in the world. And the United States cannot have its mission the prevention of any other country from gaining some of the attributes we now have," he said.
Citing differences between the two countries that could complement each other globally, Kissinger said, "The world's most populous country and the world's most technologically advanced country should not be in avoidable conflict and they should seek to find ways to solve problems jointly."
His remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. also included praise for President Bush's handling of U.S. - China relations, and a pronouncement that diplomatic relations between the two countries have improved since Richard Nixon's historic visit of 1972.Theres more if you have a strong stomach.

The book reads like a classic fiction spy novel with twists and turns that keep the reader intrigued. I found the parallel story of Louis Freeh, the then FBI director, as well as deep insights into the KGB, and concurrent FBI initiatives over the 20 year story truley fasinating. The book contains actual letters, photos, and an excellent synopsis of what top secret security items were lost by the United States.

We will provoke you to acts of terror and then crush you.  Gen. Zubatov, head of Russian Czarist secret police, circa 1905 It should be obvious to anyone, even sane people who don't waste their time on conspiracy theories, that there's a lot more to any government's war on terrorism than they want to let on officially. Countless well-documented cases throughout history show governments either completely manufacturing and faking terrorist acts, or knowingly allowing them to take place in order to further their own plans. This was the case with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, which by most accounts President Roosevelt knew of weeks beforehand, but allowed to go on in order to shock the American public into accepting an unpopular war and repressive measures at home, including the dispossession and internment of Japanese immigrants. And a few years earlier, the Nazi Party in Germany had come to power by staging the burning of the Reichstag (Parliament) building, which they blamed on Communists and used as an excuse to declare a military government. Just a few examples should suffice to show a pattern throughout recent history. 1886, Chicago: During the labor movement's campaign for an 8-hour day, police shot 6 workers at a rally in Haymarket Square. A protest rally was called for the next day, and someonewitnesses claimed it was a police provocateurthrew a dynamite bomb at the police. Police responded by shooting into the crowd, injuring hundreds, raiding and detaining without warrants all the known leaders of the movement, and eventually sentencing 8 anarchists to death for the bomb. 1910, Los Angeles: The city fathers were nervous about a successful union organizing campaign and a mayor's race where a Socialist candidate looked ready to win. With the help of the newly formed Red Squad, business leaders were able to pull victory out of defeat with the use of a bomb explosion in the L.A. Times offices. While there was no evidence that this was anything other than a police provocation, two union leaders were indited for the blast and it was used as an excuse to break up any kind of organized working-class power throughout the city and pass new repressive laws against radicals. 1969, Italy: an ongoing campaign of bombs by Italian fascists was repeatedly blamed on leftists (much the way the Oklahoma City bombing was first blamed on Arabs). The most well-known, at the Piazza Fontana in Milan, was initially blamed on anarchists, and one anarchist was thrown out of a window during interrogation, before evidence came to light implicating the Italian intelligence (SID) and the CIA. 1972, San Diego: an agent working for LAPD's Criminal Conspiracy Section leaked a story to the underground press about a police plan to set off bombs inside the Republican Convention, which would justify a crackdown on the coalition of anti-war, black power, and other groups protesting outside the convention, and possibly even cancel the 1972 elections, leaving Nixon in control and his war effort unchallenged. This plan never took place, probably due to the leak beforehand, but two men mentioned as being involvedboth CIAlater came to light as the 'burglars' at the Watergate Hotel in Washington. Now its useless to be too conpiracy-minded in our thinking. No one wants to be the nutcase spending his whole life looking for the smoking gun in JFK's assassination, while meanwhile the CIA and all their people are doing crazier and crazier things all the time. Most likely, there will never be any conclusive proof as to what really happened on September 11th, and its pointless to waste all our time looking for it. But knowing that this sort of thing has happened before (and many times before), I don't think it makes any sense whatsoever to accept the Bush clique's account of what happened at face value. Maybe the plot was hatched by al-Qaida, but somehow the CIA or Mossad knew about and encouraged it. Even if not, even if the CIA had no idea what was happening, the blame still falls sqarely on them: for training and supporting fundamentalists in Afghanistan since 1978, for supporting and working with bin Laden up till maybe 10 years ago, and for aiding the Taliban all the way up till 2 or 3 years ago. Not to mention for creating the warzone conditions throughout the world that lead people to see Americans as legitimate targets.

@_subject: Chicago 7 book review.THE CHICAGO CONSPIRACY TRIAL By John 
THE CHICAGO CONSPIRACY TRIAL By John Schultz, New Introduction by Carl Oglesby, Da Capo Press New York 1993 Edition, First Published 1972 ISBN 0-306-80513-8 The police reaction to several thousand anti-war protesters at the Democratic Parties National convention in Chicago in August 1968 was a turning point in the history of the American anti-war movement. The Chicago police9s brutal response to the peaceful demonstrators, turned the anti-war movement from a generally peaceful movement to one which rapidly launched an all out attack on "the system". The Chicago conspiracy trial was turned into courtroom theatre by the eight defendants who had been charged with "conspiracy to cause violence and violation of the new federal anti-riot statute". A statute which was passed just before the Democratic convention to arrest and bring to trial prominent members of the emerging new left movement. Richard Nixon and Edgar J Hoover played significant behind the scene roles in this little travesty of justice. John Schultz9s account of the Chicago Eight trial highlights the absurdity of the charges and the behaviour of the courts. He guides the reader through the trial, trying to recreate the climate within the court room. His account is lucid, sharp even entertaining. Very little escapes his eye. I found chapter three especially interesting. Bobby Seale head of the Black Panthers and one of the Chicago eight understood that this trail was no joke. His experiences as a black militant in America prepared him for the bruising encounters that the defendants had with the United States legal system. Hoffman the judge attempted to maintain order by escalating the tension within the court. At one stage Bobby Seale was bound and gagged in the court room and sentenced to four years jail for numerous counts of contempt. The book gives an insight into the jury9s thinking and most importantly of all highlights the political nature of the trial. While Nixon and Kissinger bombed the shit out of Cambodia and Vietnam they conducted a war on protestors in the United States by singling out the anti-war movements leaders and placing them on trial. Their actions made a mockery of the government, law and legal system. The Chicago Conspiracy Trial by John Schultz opens the lid on the United States government stock in trade half-truths and lies. This book could be languishing in the remainder section of your local radical bookshop. Buy it, read it and save it from a life of anonymity.

@_subject: How would an anarchist society deal with a major schism? 
ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER Q. How would an anarchist society deal with a major schism? A. Nothing tests a society more than a major schism within that community. Civil war is often the result of unresolved differences within a community. Anarchist communities are no different to any other community, they can face the problem of a major schism. Although mechanisms exist within an anarchist society which allow majorities and minorities that have differences that are encompassed within the principles of association of that society to resolve them, problems arise when the principles of association are under threat. How this threat is handled will determine whether the community will disintegrate or not. If there is disagreement about the principals of association, mechanisms will exist within these principles which will allow a dialogue to occur about the principles. If no agreement can be reached about these basic principles processes need to be put in motion which will allow both the minority and majority to function under different principles. Property and institutions will need to be divided according to the numbers on each side. Problems will arise if one group attempts to use force to force the other group to adhere to principles they don9t believe in. The situation is analogous to the fate of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. In one case the country peacefully divided into the Czech and Slovak republic while in Yugoslavia they underwent a very painful civil war that left a legacy of death and destruction. The difference revolved around the use of force. One side used force in an attempt to artificially keep the Yugoslavian republic together while the other side came to an agreement about how to separate when they realised no agreement was possible on the principles of association that bound the Nation State together. The best way for an anarchist community to avoid schisms about its principles of association (equal access to wealth and power) is by making sure that the mechanisms which have been established to ensure that these principles are applied work effectively. If they work it is unlikely significant segments of the community will want to revert back to a situation where inequalities in power and wealth are the norm not the exception.

@_subject: "...wild orgasm of an anarchists sweeping across the country 
THE LAND OF THE BRAVE AND FREE It's interesting to note that the sentiments expressed by Richard Nixon in the first six months of the 1972 (The Age 2/3) (contained in the tapes just released from the White House) that if the anti-war Movement was not destroyed, he envisaged "a wild orgasm of an anarchists sweeping across the country like a prairie fire". If by some chance that prairie fire had burnt across the United States, the United States would not be the death loving culture it is today. People, who still believe that the United States is the land of freedom and opportunity, only have to examine the facts to see that the myth still outshines the reality. At any one time, the United States has around 1.5% of its citizens in jail, mainly blacks and latinos. The gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the western world. The United State's government, through the activities of its armed forces and the C.I.A, has been responsible for more coups and deaths in the world, than any other government over the past three decades. The United States holds the largest supply of weapons of mass destruction in the world including chemical, biological, as well as nuclear weapons. It's people are so disillusioned with the political process that only 33% of registered voters, vote for the Congress and Senate and only about 45% of registered voters, vote for the President. The politics of hate and segregation still play a pivotal role in United States life. The economic dream is manipulated by a corporate sector that continues to strive to create profits, irrespective of the human, social and environmental costs. The United States executes more of its citizens than any other country other than China. The United States government acts as if the rest of the world exists for the benefit of the United States. If Richard Nixon's nightmare about anarchism had become a reality, its probable that September the 11th and its aftermath would never have happened. Thirty years on, the names in this story may have changed, but the tactics of the Presidency and the United States Senate and Congress have not.

>From Glasgow McDonalds Workers Resistance PO Box 3828
Monthly Bulletin, February 2002
Dear friends,
Unremarkably, we did nothing over Christmas and new
year except got pissed, constantly. Nevertheless, we
do have a few bits of news to report.
The comically overdue website is now online at:
It's not very good, but it's there! So please visit
us. Also, if you're going to be kind enough to link to
us, then please link to  as the hosting
is temporary but that address will be permanent.
We were cut from a BBC documentary on fast food
because we were apparently too politically contentious
for a show being produced by Tim Henman's wife. We
were really pissed off about this 'cos we'd bought
loads of balaclavas especially. In the end, our
ambiguous relationship with the mass media has
continued, bizarrely, with an interview in March's
'Loaded' magazine, the editor apparently said there
was room for a few more tits... So we're sandwiched
between Carmen Electra and Helena Christensen, etc.
Buy it, really! It's only  and you get advice on
cunnilingus and a free sachet of conditioner...
Seriously, we don't think there is much point talking
to ourselves, we want to communicate with our
co-workers, which is our justification for doing an
interview with a not very nice low quality wank mag.
Solidarity to our comrades in Paris: since the 24th
October the workers at the Strasbourg-St.Denis branch
of McDonald's in Paris have been on strike for the
reinstatement of five of their colleagues, who were
accused of theft by the management (who have not
provided any evidence for their claim). It was
obviously a coincidence that the five workers sacked
were candidates for the 'elections professionnelles',
a kind of works council. The management ignored the
strikers at first which quickly made clear to the
strikers and their support committee that the movement
had to be expanded. For this reason the strikers and
the committee have been regularly picketing a
different McDonald's branch since November. These
actions have made it possible to come to a list of
demands: for a 6% wage increase; better working
conditions; bonuses for 'dirty work'; recognition of
the right to strike and the right for trade union
organisation... This has broadened out the struggle
and inceased the consciousness of the employees, to
show that the fight is not only against the management
[of one branch], but against employment without
protection and workers' rights [i.e. against 'McJobs']
The five young workers who were sacked won a tribunal
case against McDonald's on 25th January and the court
said they have to be given their jobs back. However
the fight is not over and there was a massive demo in
Paris on 2nd February. Email the strikers at:
soutien_macdo and see
We should also introduce our new friends the
'McDonalds International Liberation Front' to whom we
send our solidarity, even though they do insist on
describing us as "pussy white boys". We've let them

Solidarity to our friends the Workers Resistance
against McDonalds, they got caught by McDonalds for
their activities at the end of last year. What got
them was that folk knew about their internet
abilities, so unlikely to be a problem for us!
McDonalds quizzed all the staff in their area about
who was competent on computers. Scary people. Still,
their struggle goes on, indeed it's flourishing, they
have contacts in several stores. They've changed the
location of their website, it's now at:
MWR's group in Stirling (also in Scotland) is
thriving, they can be e-mailed at:
Special thanks to everyone who has done or is doing
translation work for us, it's greatly apreciated.
Finally, we have to note that senior management failed
to send us a Christmas card this year despite us
having sent them this lovely effort last year (see:
  )
  This is a clear snub and is really just plain
ignorant. Fucking parasites.
Hope everyone had a good Christmas and new year,
Love and solidarity,
McDonalds Workers Resistance.

If you want to know the difference between the work of
today and the activity that represents our future, then

@_subject: Viva La Pretzleista's,VIVA! 
Tonight Twin Cities activists are awaiting the release of two individuals arrested this afternoon during a protest in downtown Minneapolis against Illegitimate President Bush. Approximately 200 protestors gathered outside of the Radisson Hotel on Tenth Street South and Marquette Avenue at 4:45 PM to voice a myriad of complaints against Bush, the "War" on terrorism and subsequent infringements on civil liberties as the Installed President schmoozed with local Republicans to raise funds for Senate hopeful Norm Coleman. Demonstrators from a wide variety of groups including the National Lawyer's Guild, the United Steelworkers of America and the Minnesota Anti-War Committee held banners and shouted chants for nearly two hours from the west sidewalk of Marquette Avenue. A mysterious group calling itself the Pretzeltistas distributed (low fat) pretzels to the crowd and threw them into the street and possibly at police officers. At least fifteen members of the Minneapolis Police Department in uniform were also present, as well as one man some demonstrators believed to be an undercover The arrested activists, identified by comrades only as "Sir Bakesalot" and "Puddle," were arrested after the Prezeltistas ignored an order by MPD officers to cease the pretzel throwing. Numerous eyewitnesses confirmed that around 5:20 PM four or five MPD officers shoved and kicked their way into the crowd and grabbed "Puddle" first. The woman was dragged from the arms of those around her, thrown against a wall and arrested in a scene one onlooker described as being "like a mosh pit." "Sir Bakesalot" was arrested a moment later.
"The cops came running in here, pushing people aside, and they go after one person who happens to have a jar of fucking pretzels" said one eyewitness who declined to be identified. "They threw her up against the wall, and they pushed everybody else away who was trying to hold her back and then they took her and another person away and arrested them" said the witness. Several witnesses insisted that neither Sir Bakesalot nor Puddle resisted "Apparently they have very little sense of irony" speculated Steve Young, a University of Minnesota graduate student who saw the incident occur. Anonymous Pretzeltistas later admitted to the IMC that they, not the Pretzel 2, were responsible for hitting police with pretzels.
Caroline S. Palmer, a member of the National Lawyer's Guild said that her group was there to show the "President" and state lawmakers that the public was aware of and angry about infringements on civil liberties through legislation like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Minnesota Anti-Terrorism Act of 2002. "People are here today because they're sick of seeing their rights taken apart" said Palmer, adding that anyone interested in civil liberties could learn more at "I'm here to stick up for my rights, " said Bridget MacDonald, a retired school teacher and Sister of Saint Joseph. "I'm here for democracy. I don't think Mr. Bush understands the erosion of democracy that's happened in this county. He only listens to the rich, the corporate oligarchy. He needs to listen to the people on the street."
Shortly before six o' clock approximately 40 protesters split off from the main demonstration and headed for the Hennepin County jail to demonstrate in solidarity with the pair immediately dubbed as "the Pretzel Two." With black banners flying in the early evening breeze, the faction marched through the street without police permission up Marquette Avenue to Fifth Street, then up Third Avenue to Fourth Street without a major police appearance. As the demonstration turned south on Fourth Avenue, a police car backed through a clump of demonstrators crossing the street legally as another officer directed traffic with his club drawn. Police did not threaten the illicit marchers with arrest until demonstrators voluntarily claimed the sidewalk on Fourth Avenue.
The marchers then waited outside the Hennepin County jail and sent a representative, who asked to be identified only as "Maude," who inquired as to the status of the Pretzel Two. Officer WR Wilen told Maude that the Pretzel Two were being booked and would remain in police custody for at least four hours. The last of the demonstrators dispersed by 7:30 PM. A posting on the IMC newswire claims that the Pretzel Two should be released by 10 or 11 PM tonight.

US pays Afghan warriors $384 a month
By Rory McCarthy in Zurmad
Afghan soldiers involved in the campaign against Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan are being trained and paid $US200 ($384) a month by American troops, it has emerged.
One senior Afghan commander said at least 2000 al-Qaeda fighters, including Arabs, Chechens and Pakistanis, were holed up with Taliban soldiers in an underground base at Shahi-Khot, near here.
Planning for the attack began at least a month ago when 600 local Afghan men, many of them unemployed, were recruited into a new military force and trained by US troops.
Each recruit is being paid in cash by the American soldiers. In addition, every man was given a $US50 gift for the Muslim festival of Eid last month.
Khail Mohammad, 22, said he joined the force a month ago, attracted by the money and the promise of proper military training. He was immediately given American-made clothes and boots and a Kalashnikov rifle.
"We are given $US200 a month. They didn't give the money to our commanders but straight to us," said Mr Mohammad. The average monthly wage in Afghanistan is closer to $US40.
For three weeks Mr Mohammad and other recruits were given basic military training, which included guard duty, how to surround an enemy and elementary first aid.
They then received four days of intensive weapons training. Each man was offered lessons in one weapon: Kalashnikov assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades or machine guns.
Following the weapons training they began a four-day exercise to prepare for the attack on Shahi-Khot. On the fifth day, Saturday, the attack began.
Afghan soldiers just back from the battlefield said the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters who shot down the US helicopters fear nothing and will defend their positions to the last man.
"They didn't tell us about their courage or manner. But what we saw from fighting them, they fear nothing, not aircraft or bombs. Though we have these things, they do not fear them," said Khial Mahmad.
Mr Mahmad said his fighters ran into withering fire.
"Sometimes when we confront our enemies, we either advance or retrace our steps. We have been forced back. They control the top of the mountains, which is why we need the American helicopters and bombers," he said.
"We were informed that aircraft had softened up the area, reducing the risk, and we were supposed to just search and explore. But when we got there, our enemies were very much alive, with guns in their hands."
Afghan Commander Sultan Mahmad said helicopters were ideal for attacking the rebels because they could manoeuvre and target the tiny cave entrances.
Much of the area around Zurmad is still regarded as sympathetic to the A Canadian journalist was badly hurt on Monday when she was travelling

PSYCHIATRIC FASCISM
For almost 150 years, psychiatry has been masquerading as a medical science and as a branch of medicine. It is not and never was a science or a type of health care. Modern psychiatry is driven by unproved empirical assumptions, medical biases, and pseudo-scientific opinions. There are no scientifically established, independently proven facts in psychiatry. Psychiatry, in fact, has no laws or testable hypotheses and no coherent and comprehensive theory. Psychiatry conspicuously lacks scientific proof or evidence to support its news-media-parroted claims of "mental illness" or "disorders".
After about seventy years of psychiatric practices and research, there is still no diagnostic test for schizophrenia or any of the other three hundred so-called mental disorders listed in the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is essentially a list of class-driven moral judgements of allegedly abnormal behaviour, published and propagandized by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM is the official bible of organized psychiatry. The DSM is the equivalent of the Malleus Maleficarum in the middle ages, which Spanish inquisitors used to identify, target, stigmatize and burn witches and heretics.MORE...

The Police: A bunch of organized and legalized
criminals at the service of capitalism and the state.
Police are constantly a part of our lives. In the
urban centers of our region, it is normal to cross a
patrol car every two minutes. We are no longer
surprised or alerted when we see police officers. On
the contrary, we are surprised when they are absent!
Police are everywhere and justice is nowhere to be
found; the forces of "law and order" reinforce a
regime which seeks to crush and criminalize the poor
and the powerless when they protest their class
Stealing food from a supermarket is "illegal" because
it protests the commodification of food supply and
distribution rackets. Acting politically in a direct
and autonomous fashion is "anti-democratic" and
"illegal", since "legal" politics are strictly
reserved to politicians and lobbyists. Police prevent
demonstrations which question the social peace of our
rulers from taking place, claiming them to be
"illegal" assemblies. The police break-up picket lines
of "illegal" strikers to let "legal" scabs pass
through. Police evict people from their homes and
squatters from their squats in the name of a "legal"
notice emitted by real estate owners... It's no
coincidence that it's often one class of people who
end up in "illegality" and a whole other class of
people who end up in "legality". While the police
protect the privileges of the powerful, the decision
makers, the rulers, the rich and the owners... it
tries to prevent the rest of us from struggling,
organizing and even sometimes from satifying our most
basic needs.
But, on top of maintaining the chains of capitalism
and the State on us, the police often take pleasure in
squeezing them, increasing their tension until our
bones break and our blood flows. Police beat, torture,
brutalize and kill. This year, on March 15th 2002, we
will walk and protest in solidarity with Carlo
Guliani, an anarchist, 23, killed last July in an
anti-globalization demonstration in Genoa, Italy. We
will be with Timothy Thomas, a young black man, 19,
who was shot by police last April, becoming the 15th
black victim of police murder in Cincinnati in the
last 5 years. We stand with Abner Louima, victim of
one of the worst cases of police brutality in New York
City's history. Our solidarity will also be extended
to the insurgents of Argentina, Bolivia and elsewhere,
particularly to the martyrs of the uprisings. Even
more, we would like to emphasize our support of all
the anonymous victims of the forces of the State.
People who while having faced acts of brutality, often
find themselves isolated in their legal struggle
against the police to regain their dignity and some
sense of justice. It is extremely important to let
these people know that they shouldn't be disempowered
by acts of police brutaility against them and that we
are right in being outraged!
We salute the work of groups like the Collective
Opposed to Police Brutality (COPB) from Montreal, who
actively support victims of police brutality. On top
of guiding them through the legal process, COPB brings
friendly solidarity and tries to demonstrate that a
larger, collective struggle is possible against this
form of oppression. They teach us all the precious
lesson that in face of repression, solidarity is our
strongest weapon! We believe that it is by organizing
and struggling with people who have been closely
touched by the police plague, these people who often
share our rage against authority, that we will be able
to build a mass revolutionary movement that will trace
extreme manifestations of authority to it's source:
the domination of one class over another, the rule of
the rich and the rulers over the poor and ruled. We
call on all revolutionary anarchists and all the
supporters of anti-authoratarian revolution, on all
the victims of police brutality and all the people who
can no longer stomach this system of injustice to
participate in the 6th International Day of Police
Brutality. Like in the last six years, this day is as
important as ever. The culture of resistance to the
police is growing! This day is truly international, in
past years, March 15th demonstrations have been held
in Colombia, Chile, Switzerland, Chattanooga Tennessee
etc. This year, our organization, the Northeastern
Federation of Anarcho-Communists (NEFAC) has agreed to
join COPB locally in Montreal to help mobilize for the
March 15th demonstration. Events around IDAPB will
also be held in different cities of our region.
In Montreal: Demonstration called by COPB. Friday
March 15th. Berri Square. 5p.m. Contact:
In Quebec city: March 15th Cultural event. Contact
In Toronto: March 15th. Mass flyering in the
working-class (and police occupied) neighborhood of

Police injustice will no longer be tolerated!
Our struggle has no borders, it's the struggle of our
class thoughout the world!
For Anarchy and Communism!

"The operations involve men, women and children toiling under primitive conditions, often unaware of the health and environmental hazards involved in operations that include open burning of plastics and wires, riverbank acid works to extract gold, and burning of toxic soldered circuit boards," the report says.
"Already the pollution has become so devastating that well water is no longer drinkable."
The report says Australia and Europe are signatories to the Basel Convention on hazardous waste, but the US is not.
US legislation allows exports of hazardous wastes, provided they are recycled.
The Australian Government has accused the US of allowing a loophole for "sham" recycling operations that dump most of the waste.
Environment Australia - the government agency that controls waste exports - has not received any applications for the export of technology waste since After dumping incidents in the Philippines in 1993 and in Hong Kong in 1997, Australia had cracked down on technology waste, Greenpeace toxics campaigner Matt Ruchel said.

The Fate Of The Earth
by Jonathan Schell from When Jonathan Schell heard all that loose talk about attainment of objectives in a limited nuclear war, it was too much for him and he did what all of us would like to do: he wrote a book.
It is very pessimistic. The mere presence of all those weapons is enough to ensure that sometime, somewhere, someone is going to set one off.
Schell makes sure all of us know the horrendous possibilities of a nuclear exchange and all the reasons for bringing such possibilities to a halt.
Everyone agrees. The question is, how do we get these monsters under control?
The World Reduced to Grass and Insects, July 11, 2001
Reviewer: Gavin M Douglas (see more about me) from Lexington, Va United States
This book attempts to conceptualize the idea of a full scale nuclear exchange between the cold war superpowers, since the idea itself is now "unthinkable". To explore this lack of understanding the author first explains in detail the immediate and long lasting effects of full scale nuclear war. Then, he comments on the situation, making a bid for sanity in an insane situation. The author believes that self-destruction and even planetary destruction "is not something that we will pose one day in the future... it is here now" (182). Schell believes that only a fundamental change in the belief system of the people of the entire planet can erase the danger currently hanging over the world.

Recently released government documents show that the US government
experimented in bio-warfare and radiation testing using live subjects. Among
other experiments: Dr Joseph G. Hamilton of the University of California
hospital at SanFrancisco proposed a radioactive aerosol as a military
weapon. Experiments were conducted giving "lethal dose" exposures to
terminal patients. At least one of the "terminal" patients had been
misdiagnosed: he only had an ulcer. In Miami, Florida, radioactive needles
were placed in an Army private's nostrils.  At the Vanderbilt University
Medical Center 751 late-term pregnant women were given radioactive water 30
times background radiation levels at a free clinic. Twelve "battlefield
radiation" tests were carried out over Tennessee and Utah. The US Air Force
dropped radioactive cluster bombs dispersing as much as 15,000 curies in
open-air fall-out tests. In Virginia, aspergillus fumagatus, a potentially
lethal bacterium, was released upon mainly black workers at the Norfolk
Naval Supply Center. In a nation-wide test 235 new-born babies were injected
with radioactive iodide. In Memphis six out of every seven babies selected
were black. Mainly non-English speaking Eskimos in Alaska were given an
apple and orange each for their participation in Army tests to inject them
with radioactive iodide. At least 34 underground nuclear tests in the US
released significant levels of radiation into the atmosphere.  Retarded
children in a school in Massachusetts were given doses of radiation in their
breakfast cereal. Prisoners in Oregon and Washington agreed to have their
testicles dipped in radioactive water for $5.00 per week. The directors of
the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a magazine that has campaigned for
nuclear disarmament since 1947,  say that the danger of nuclear war is the
highest that it's been since the end of the Cold War.

ISPs forced to spy on email
Kate Mackenzie
MARCH 22, 2002
NEW Zealand's Government plans to force telcos and ISPs to install equipment allowing police to eavesdrop on phone calls and emails.
New Zealand's Associate Minister of Justice Paul Swain confirmed the requirements would be introduced as part of the Telecommunications (Interception Capability) Bill that was being drafted. It would go before the Law and Order Select Committee and be opened to public comment before it could be introduced.
"What I'm outlining today is how we expect that to happen," Mr Swain said If passed, the laws would give network operators and ISPs between 18 months and five years to comply with the requirements. The Government would pay for upgrades to existing networks, but companies would be expected to foot the cost for new builds.
A spokeswoman for Mr Swain said it had not yet been determined what technology would be used, or whether all companies would have to use the same type of interception technology.
"How it's physically done yet to be worked out," she said.
Mr Swain said the laws would bring New Zealand into line with other countries including Australia, the UK and the US.
"It doesn't mean that it's identical to those laws, it just means it's on equal footing," the spokeswoman said.
The laws would also target hacking crimes, which were not covered by any specific laws in New Zealand.

MARCH 19, 2002
YANGON: Some 10,000 new email accounts will be handed out to members of the public in Myanmar, where until now only 4000 carefully selected citizens have had access to the technology.
The Myanmar Times reported the email accounts would go online within the next few weeks to users in the capital Yangon and the northern city of It did not say who they would go to, but the recipients are likely to be privileged figures or prominent businesspeople in the military-controlled nation, where access to all forms of communication is severely restricted.
Bagan Cybertech, a semi-government organisation, will issue the accounts as well as provide internet access to government departments and a limited number of other organisations.
The new email users will also have access to some 800 sites on the web as well as about 50 on the local intranet, the company's director Htein Win says.
"The issue of these new email accounts will see a steep rise in internet usage. Since 1997, Myanma Posts and Telecommunication was the only email and internet service provider and accounts were limited," he says.
Travel agents and tour operators, IT companies, exporters and importers had expressed interest, he says.

hello folks, we are looking for feed back, positive or negative on the ideas we hope to put forward in a new paper we hope to get out around the start of June, if you like what we have to say and want to spread them, we can send you a flyer with this text and pretty graphics. you can email feedback, death threats or whatever to greenanarchyusa salud We Too Have a Dream... A dream of a society based on mutual aid and voluntary cooperation without the coercion of a ruling elite. We dream of a world without wars, poverty and oppression, where all are valued and free to live our lives rather than the hollow lifestyle sold to us by corporate masters. We hope for a world of play and happiness beyond the dull monoculture of this one. Reality today is full of unfulfilled people travelling in streets full of banks, shops, traffic and neon lights. Streets full of cops and adverts of things you don?t even need. We live rushing to work, punching the clock when we should be punching our boss. This is capitalist reality-selling lifestyles that are a very poor imitation of having a real life. There is a real world outside of this capitalist crap, as its been said under the pavement a beach. We most oppose the state and all forms of coercion. We oppose national borders. Ideas of ethnic or cultural superiority recreate the world we hope to escape. Private property and money create social division and injustice. Society Sucks Governments have nothing to give us except what they have first taken away. No one can give us freedom. Groups that promise freedom and peace lie and give us war and injustice, perpetrating the injustice of hierarchy in the name of liberty. The colonialism so deeply ingrained in our minds has created the monotone McCulture of the western world that is being sold to the globe in the flashing images on TV and on the silverscreen of Hollywood. The disenchantment of industrial production with its time clocks, specialization, and production for profit for its own sake is a further division of labor that create classism and hierarchy. Social class did not fall from the moon. It was created using the division of labor. In hunter and gatherer societies men hunted and women gathered. As time went by the hunters turn to warriors and then to Kings. This was the embryo of the modern patriarchal world. Social classes produce a psychology of domination, and when people lose control of their destinies they in turn try to control someone or thing else. This alienation is the creator of class war, sexism racism homophobia and ecological destruction. Whenever someone else is in control humanity and everything else on the planet is endangered. Because of fetishism of commodities, we fill our lives with stuff. We must work to fill the void left by the consumer world. We fail to notice how stuck we are in the vicious circle of production, having to work to pay for things we don?t really need as well as working to make more junk. Its an insane paper chase and completely unnecessary, except to keep consumer capitalism grinding on. Perhaps only 5% of the work done today feeds, heats and lights our lives, the rest is pretty much unnecessary. A move away from work would obviously benefit the more down trodden people in society. Remember the old saying a woman?s work is never done? Well its true that women do about 80% of work in the world for very little reward. Humanity is out of step with the planet around us. We must reconnect with the earth and become, once again, part of the ecosystem rather than outside looking in. The richness and diversity of all forms of life have value and humanity is part of this web of life and not its center. People are not happy with this world, even the police, one of the states guard dogs, fought in Madrid because they were unhappy with their jobs having to enforce a drinking ban. In Britain Commander Brian Paddick, who is in charge of policing in Lambeth, south London, recently said, "the concept of anarchism has always appealed to me". In an insane consumer world where you have to work long hours so you can fill your life with plastic, Prozac and flickering light to fill the void created by the disenchantment that modern capitalism has become. Small is Beautiful The boredom of society today can?t be reformed it must be replaced. We seek to replace the dominant culture of death with the ecology of everyday life, where we reconnect with ourselves and the planet around us. A concrete world breed?s apathy but even the cities were built on fertile soil and fresh water we just need to break through the surface. If we are to reconnect ourselves to the world around us we need to work together. Mutual aid and cooperation in affinity groups in a community is the anti-dote to the alienation of mass society. This will, if we are success overcome the cultural baggage that has created racism. If a cat and a crow can work together surely people can. Something I saw recently pointed out that racists aren?t born but created by the culture we grow up in. All too often people who wish to see the end of oppression just mirror the structure of the oppressor and replace it. Identity pimp sell us ideas of a class, gender or ethnic group being the true suppliers of freedom when there are really repackaging the old world with news tape with the freedom of a few only in the name of the people. We desire community beyond the isolation of our modern existence trapped as we our into our mundane lives making us easier to trap into the capitalism existence of wage slavery with only commodity fetishism, your are what you own in this world after all, to pacify your anomie. There is a continuing appeal of nationalism in ever so called radical centers. For as long as there is social division and separation their can never be equality, in fact powerful elite relay out social division to stay in control of use, the need to divide to stay in power over us and use fear to continue the status quo. We can?t use the master?s tools, like nationalism or alienation, to destroy the masters house. You only have to look at Israel to see that even those who have lived through a holocaust repeat the pattern of other states. Cultural, political and ethnic isolation perpetuates this racists system. If we are to have a free, just world we need a human community of empowered individuals who can work together. Our liberation can?t be imposed, you can liberate me and I can liberate you but our liberation comes when we can work together. An old native America prophecy talks of people of all creeds, colors and religions joining to save the planet and in turn liberating us too. Land and Liberty Malcolm X once pointed out that all revolutionary struggles are centered on the question of land. The agriculture/food industry is the second most profitable industry in the capitalist world after the pharmaceutical industry, so if we can learn to take care of ourselves through free skools, to be able to feed ourselves and have health care for those around us, then we are taking direct action. We are undermining the systems hold over the world and us. Globalism needs resources from across the planet to survive. The mega machine exploits those who work the land; people who have nothing to gain from cooperating with capital and so take back the land. Groups in Central America and South America like the EZLN or MST re occupy land just the same all urban guerilla gardeners do in cities around the US. These ideas are nothing new as even during the Middle Ages people like the Taborites, the free Spirit, the Diggers to Modern times like the Maknovists in the Ukraine, those who agreed with the Magon brothers and agricultural collectives in Spain have all fought for the land. When people talk of over population-the famines and the destruction it creates--they are missing the point. It?s industrialism that forces people to move away from the land and into cities in search of food and profit, creating an atmosphere of overcrowding and poverty. Often times when peoples go hungry it is not for lack of food but lack of justice. It?s more profitable to feed grain and soy grown in the third world to animals at industrial farms in the west than feed it to the poor. During the famine in Ethiopia in the 80?s for every bag of grain given to the refugees displaced during the civil war Ethiopia exported 4 bags to pay back its debt so it could continue fighting the war. By 2028 there is going to be an estimated 8 billion people on the planet. We can?t simply sit back and let the agricultural industry push its lies of biotech and chemicals as the solution to the growing population. Land redistributes and the destruction of capitalism is the only hope. The poor don?t need to be growing monoculture cash crops like coffee or tea or drugs intensively to survive there need land and sustainable permaculture so as not to destroy the planet we depend on. Revolution on the Periphery It seems that as long as our struggle is not on our own terms but in the terrain of capital, there will be no creation of a better world. What is the point of occupying the factories when its production that should be stopped? Why should we wish to take over the system that imprisons us? So we can self manage our own imprisonment? Surely we are fighting a losing battle if we are fighting for industry. It?s a system so diabolical that poisons the food that we eat, water we drink and air we breath why would we want to take it over? Just as we need mutual aid to overcome the alienation of humanity we also need to have ecology of everyday life. We need to reconnect with the world around us and fight the psychology of domination not just of people but also of the environment. People in the third world are resisting the monopolizing of seed production and the patenting of biotech seeds. They are not buying the ideas of economic growth, predicated on the work of women and the third world. We must support their struggle by creating our own here. Modern capitalist relationships have pushed many people to the periphery of society leaving nothing to gain from the world we live in today. Peoples have been reduced to mere specters of the world around them. They have been reduced to mere consumers. People with a little jolt could disrupt their way of thinking and turn them against the system. Autonomy Now We have no desire to merely turn the world upside down but to create a human community of equals with not ruling elite. Be it a tribe, worker, city or elected council we can?t delegate our lives into someone else?s hands. We want autonomy not democracy with affinity groups deciding their own destinies. We need to learn from each other with mutual respect to create a multi culture world at peace with itself and the earth. We do believe in direct-action, action that will bring power into our hands and not that of authority. When people have to depend on the state for protection from others they help strengthen its hold on society. In a true community we don?t need a police force. The very presence of a law enforcement system in a community is an indication that something is not working. And the presence of the police is supposed to make it work? Such a force is essentially repressive, which means that certain people in such a dysfunctional community do not know how to fit in. A community is a place where there is consensus; not where there is a crooked looking onlooker with a gun, creating an atmosphere of unrest. We must beware of groups that promise a better deal. During the beginning of the industrial revolution in Britain a group rose up against the centralization and shoddy work of industrialism. They then had to face more British troops in their towns then Napoleon had to face in Europe at the same time. Despite fierce repression the Luddites still posed quite a treat so the government legalized trade unions that wanted people to work in the factories just with better pay and hours. The same tactic has historically been used by those in power from the Catholic Church to governments giving women/people of color/working class the vote so they can pick their own repressors. Often times people are called into talks and ether offered a seat at the table like during the Spanish Revolution when CNT leaders joined the government or simply gunned down like in Russia (1917-21) or Mexico (1909?). Governments will never give us our freedom we must take it from them. Learning to live free from exploitation by boycotting the institutions like banks, corporations and governments that are destroying our world. We can build a new life for each other and reclaim our destinies from those who want to control our lives. Humans are not intrinsically evil; rather the society we are raised in creates unnatural cutthroat attitudes and beliefs. If right from the outset certain people are denied all possibilities of humanity, how can they subsequently be expected to emerge as real people? When conflict comes, those who defend capital should be reduce to the level of bestial or mechanical adversities. We need to reveal and demystify and demonstrate its contradictions and rise doubt in their minds. We can?t make the mistake that we can somehow enforce our will over others or we too will become what we despise. Racketeers preach the merits of chaos and collapse, but that will not bring about a better world for all its inhabitants. Empires have come and gone but the social relationship, the class structure and the domination of nature continues. Without a proactive approach there is no hope. We should learn from the past and carry those lessons onto a free and just society for all. People can learn to cooperate and humanity can learn to coexist with the world around it. Do not be fooled by those who talk about the total destruction rather than a world where the true beauty of mutually cooperative society exists

An investigation has been ordered into the allegations by Maha Habib that $7,000 in cash was taken from the family's Birrong home during a raid by ASIO on September 20 last year, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
Family solicitor Stephen Hopper said a mobile telephone belonging to the eldest son of the accused, Mamdouh Habib, was also taken and has not been returned, the newspaper said.
A record of property seized in the raid included two mobile telephones - of which only one was returned - and did not acknowledge the $7,000 being taken, Mr Hopper told the newspaper.
Intelligence and Security Inspector-General Bill Blick has referred the accusation to the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, the newspaper reported.
Meanwhile, the federal government has stepped up pressure on the United States to allow Australian intelligence agents to interview Mr Habib.
The US has so far failed to respond to specific Australian requests for information on the case, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
Mr Habib, 46, was arrested in Pakistan in October before being secretly sent to Egypt the next month, then transferred to US military custody in Afghanistan 10 days ago over alleged links to the terrorist network.

in forcing ISP xs4all.nl to remove the original Radikal site and threatened
Google with a lawsuit to remove the links from their database.]
 Indymeda.nl refuses to remove
links to Radikal site despite being summoned indymedia.nl, 24.04.2002 21:39
Press release Indymeda.nl refuses to remove links to Radikal site despite
being summoned to do so by Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) Tuesday 23 april the
newsmedium Indymedia NL has received a letter from a lawfirm representing
Deutsche Bahn AG demanding the removal of an internet page. The page in
question contains some links to mirrors of the -long defunct- german
periodical Radikal. Two articles contained in those mirrors have been the
subject of a lawsuit last week. DB objects to these articles because these
contain instructions on how to obstruct the heavily critized German nuclear
transports. By way of a judicial procedure, Internet provider XS4ALL has
been ordered to remove these pages from the homepage of one of its
subscribers. After this removal, many mirrors have sprung up all over the
world. If the Indymedia page containing links to th7ese mirrors is not
removed immediately, DB will sue, their letter states. Indymedia NL
adamantly refuses to comply with DB4s demand to remove the links for the
following three reasons: Firstly the links in question do not directly lead
to the disputed articles, but to mirrors in which the articles are
contained. The articles therefore are at least three "clicks" away (from
indymedia to the mirror and from the mirror to the content page of the
Radikal editions and from there to the articles). Complying with this
request would mean jeopardizing the fundaments of the internet, since links
are the esence of this medium. Secondly, Indymedia NL is part of a
worldwide independent news network, entirely produced by volunteers. Using
the open publishing system, anyone can freely publish his or her news in
the form of text, audio, video or photos. Principally Indymedia.nl does not
want to censor or prevent people from placing links to news sources. We
believe that everyone has the right to place links, notwithstanding the
content available through these links. Thirdly, Indymedia NL thinks that
conforming to the demand would jeopardize the national and international
freedom of the press, which is the basis of every democratic system. The
possibility for censorship of hyperlinks in this way would have severe
negative consequences for relevant provision of information in all layers
of society (media, education, etc). Indymedia NL therefore calls for
support in this very fundamental issue. Indymedia stresses that the issue
is about references to freely available pages which are outside of
Indymedia4s responsibility. Updates on this case will be posted on

Soon,real soon.Lax e-security aided FBI spy
Karen Dearne
APRIL 23, 2002
A UNITED States commission reviewing FBI security in response to treason by a former special agent has been shocked at how easily he was able to steal vast amounts of secret information.
Over 22 years, Robert Hanssen gave the Russians documents and computer diskettes filled with national intelligence of "incalculable value".
In a report delivered to the US Attorney-General John Ashcroft, commission chairman William Webster said a "pervasive inattention to security" allowed Hanssen to gather information that was "tremendously useful" to hostile foreign powers.
Hanssen has pleaded guilty to 15 counts of spying and is awaiting sentencing, due next month.
Mr Webster, a former CIA and FBI director, led the commission's year-long "As shocking as the depth of Hanssen's betrayal is the ease with which he was able to steal material," Mr Webster said.
"Hanssen usually collected this material in the normal routine of an FBI manager privy to classified information that crossed his desk or came up in conversation with colleagues."
The treacherous agent worked in the Bureau's intelligence division and helped establish an automated counter-intelligence database.
"He was proficient in combing FBI automated records, and printed or downloaded to disk reams of highly classified information," Mr Webster said.
"He also did not hesitate to go into offices where he had worked some time before, log on to standalone data systems and retrieve, for example, the identities of foreign agents who US intelligence services had compromised - information vital to US interests and even more immediately vital to those he betrayed."
Hanssen initially communicated with the Soviets through encoded radio transmissions, using a one-time pad - a practically unbreakable cipher he created himself.
He installed unauthorised software on his office computers, including a password-breaking program discovered on his hard drive.
On at least one occasion, he hacked into a colleague's computer, and even downloaded a classified document from the hard drive of the chief of the Bureau's Soviet intelligence section - purportedly to demonstrate weaknesses in the system.
Early on, he suggested to his handlers that they communicate by email, but the Soviets weren't keen. Later he urged them to buy personal digital devices, so he could beam data to them.
The commission found security was often seen as an impediment to operations, which depended on the free flow of information within the Bureau.
"Operational imperatives will normally and without reflection trump security needs," Mr Webster said.
"For instance, senior Bureau management recently removed certain security-based access restrictions from the FBI's automated record system

London woman becomes fiftieth hunger striker to die in Turkey By Andrew Finkel in Istanbul and Daniel McGrory IN HER last, whispered telephone call to friends in London, Meryem Altun, 25, told them that she was determined to starve herself to death. A few weeks later, on April 1, after 301 days of refusing all solid food, the London-based community worker died in a Turkish hospital with only two prison guards for company. Ms Altun became the fiftieth person to die on a hunger strike as part of a mass protest against prison conditions in Turkey. When ten Republicans starved themselves to death in Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1981, they attracted huge publicity around the world, yet this hunger strike has passed almost unnoticed outside Turkey and the immediate area of North London where Ms Altun lived. "Nobody outside her own community even knows her name," Gurkan Gur, who worked with her in London, complained. "Fifty people starve themselves to death, including this young woman, and nobody seems to care." More FROM

A week after pit bull Sharon pissed on the shrub,fresh evidence of terminal US decay.
The assumption that bullets found at a crime scene can be matched to those in a suspect's possession has helped convict countless murderers, robbers and armed felons in the US, Britain and elsewhere. Forensic scientists analyse lead bullets for traces of antimony, tin, arsenic, copper, bismuth, silver and cadmium.
The idea is that if two bullets have the same chemical signatures, they must have been made at the same time from the same batch of smelted lead. British firearms expert Jonathan Spencer, from the forensic services firm Keith Borer Consultants in Durham, says it is also common for this link to be made in court cases in Britain.
But New Scientist has learned that this assumption is plain wrong.

Guatemala Peasants Take Plantations By Sergio De Leon Associated Press Writer Thursday, April 18, 2002; 9:53 PM GUATEMALA CITY -- Hundreds of peasants across northern Guatemala have seized 14 coffee plantations and blocked highways to protest the country's unfair distribution of farmland, officials said. Another group of protesters briefly blocked the main highway connecting the Guatemalan capital with the country's south early Thursday, but authorities reported that they were able to take down barricades of borders and branches and reopen the road after several hours. Throughout the day Wednesday, farmers' groups in the northern provinces of Alta Verapaz, Quiche and Huehuetenango stormed and occupied 14 private and state-owned coffee plantations. There were no reported injures in the uprisings. Despite government efforts to negotiate peaceful resolutions to the standoffs, protesters still controlled the plantations and their more than 12,300 acres of farmland late Thursday, said Daniel Pascual, head of the National Association of Peasant Organizations, the group which organized the uprisings. The organization said it presented a series of petitions to the Agricultural Ministry asking officials to decentralize control of large rural plantations. It has also asked the legislature to authorize more than dlrs 53 million in agricultural aid to 750 farmers' groups. ******************************* Alternative Press Review -  Your Guide Beyond the Mainstream PO Box 4710 - Arlington, VA 22204 Infoshop.org -  News Kiosk -  _______________________________________________ infoshop-news mailing list infoshop-news

TORNADOES SPARE PORN SHOPS: From a Thursday, April 18 posting in RAME arrives the following:
"Here in the Metroplex of Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas we observed very unstable clouds all afternoon Tuesday, which finally rotated during rush hour into three tornadoes, one touching down less than a half mile from a string of customer-filled "porn shops" on the eastern boundary of Fort Worth, in what formally was an unincorporated area of the county. About the same time, another tornado demolished much of the old downtown section of another eastern Fort Worth neighboring community less than five miles from the "porn epicenter", and leveled a church in the process. Thank to "the Grace of God," as quoted by the news media, no one was in the church at the time and there were no injuries. The point of all this, is my question, if things had been reversed, and the tornado had struck the cluster of porn shops instead of the church, how quickly would the same media have called it 'The Wrath of God'? Just an observation."
Voyager 7 glibly responded: "This is why I get such a kick out of the feeble-minded people who believe there is a god. Now for science. Tornadoes are steered away from major metropolitan areas by these area's 'urban heat island effect'. This is why they always brush the outskirts of an urban area, preferring easy pickings such as trailer courts and churches. You ever see the heat signature rising from a decent, well-stocked smut emporium? If there was ever an air war in this country, it's been documented in Air Force training manuals, that if you are dog fighting over an urban area, and have a heat seeking missile bearing down on your ass, to fly into the heated upward column over the nearest smut shack and the enemy's missile will get confused and drop harmlessly away, preferably into a church."

1931 -- Spain: A Republic is proclaimed. Alfonso XIII crosses paths on his
way out of Spain with hundreds of returning exiles, among them the
anarchists Buenaventura Durruti & Francisco Ascaso.
[Details, click here]
A colleague of Durruti & Ascaso, Juan Garcma Oliver, recalled in 1937 (by
then a minister of the Republic) the years of struggle when many anarchist
militants such as Sugar Baby Salvador Segui perished.
Juan GARCMA OLIVER, (Archive footage): Our anarchist group was formed in
1923. The gangs of gunmen from the employer-sponsored Sindicato Libre were
all but masters of the city & the police were conniving in the destruction
of our organisations & our personnel. We came together & set up an
anarchist group, an action group to take on the gunmen, the bosses & the
And we achieved our aim. We beat them.
1937 -- Spain: "Friends of Durruti Group," (former anarchists in the
Durruti Column) issues a Manifesto opposing commemoration of the
anniversary of the Republic, arguing it is merely a pretext for reinforcing
bourgeois institutions & the counterrevolution.
1986 -- Libya: US aircraft attacks five "terrorist" locations, killing
numerous civilians, in Tripoli & Benghazi, & assassinating the daughter of
Beloved & Respected Comrade Leader Qaddafi. The Reagan troika took a poll
before, & found that 66% of Americans approved of killing babies. Pretext
is a terrorist act in Germany attributed flimsily to a Libyan-trained group
which today remains in dispute (including possible CIA involvement).
1988 -- France: Goodbye Daniel Guerin. Dies, age 84 years. One of France's
best known revolutionary activists & thinkers, author of books such as
Fascism & Big Business; 100 Years of Labor in the USA; Anarchism; Ni Dieu,
ni Mantre: anthologie du mouvement libertaire (1965).
Within France Guerin was a well known libertarian communist, not only for
his prolific writings, but also as a long standing trade union militant of
the CGT; as a veteran anti-imperialist who supported the victims of French
aggression in Indo-China, Algeria & the Kanaks of New Caledonia; as a
fighter for gay rights (he was bisexual) in the 'Homosexual Front for
Revolutionary Action'.

The revamped Wired has lots of new features, reports Dan Fost, but "the magazine still looks like Wired -- edgy, bright, modern." There aren't as many neon colors, though, he notes. Wired has been hit hard by the tech advertising slump, and Fost wonders how long Conde Nast will support the title.

Our struggle is to encourage people to dissolve power and return it to the hands of humanity. What people do with that power is out of our hands. It is very important that people are critical of all decisions made via direct democracy and anarchy, but we will be powerless to stop it, if ultimately, that is what people choose. Now, I have enough faith in humanity that people will not come to a consensus which destroys humanity. This is why I'm comfortable with anarchy, and what anarchist societies will ultimately do with technology.

Weight Lawsuit
A New York woman is suing a snack food company for $50 million, saying the label on its Pirate's Booty corn and rice puffs foiled her diet. Meredith Berkman, 37, claims that because the snack contained three times more fat than advertised, she suffered "weight gain ... mental anguish, outrage and indignation." Pirate's Booty was recalled by Robert's American Gourmet Food in January, after Good Housekeeping found it contained 147 calories and 8.5 grams of fat, not 120 calories and 2.5 grams of fat as stated on the label. The company blamed the discrepancy on new machinery that changed the nutritional information on three of its snacks.

@_subject: Anarchists in Venezuela 
Dear comrades,
With regards to the current situation, it appears necessary to express the opinion of those who desire accuracy (1), therefore we wish to send this message, to show our consternation with this afternoon's events.
As is usual, the mean and miserable darkness of power scorns any respect for life and freedom. This never-ending crime of the State and of all vertical systems is revealing itself here and now in the demonstrations which are demanding the resignation of the president of Venezuela.
The political scene got tense a few days ago when [workers of] the oil company, PetrOleos de Venezuela, went on strike, showing its difference with the decisions the president had taken with regards to personnel. They demanded the return of the sacked workers and the validity of meritocracia (2) in the company.
To this end, thousands headed towards the governmental Miraflores Palace,with the goal of making Chavez resign. In this protest, the same as in the other ones which took place before it, a counter-protest also took place,called by the official powers, demonstrating the puppetry used by those who are in power. On the on hand, the Chavez supporters, pushing his authoritarian Bolshevik schemes, and on the other hand, the opposition,composed of the middle-class who see their feuds of power at risk, and the subjects of the ghosts who usually turn out to be the scoundrels of the moment who end up handing the post over to some lieutenant colonel (without using capital letters nor any type of respect) who does not seem to want to share the spoil with them.
The results so far are nine dead (according to the bourgeois press) and dozens of injured by snipers on the rooftops of nearby buildings and by national guards who are trying to break up the demonstration, and also by a few civil friends (3) of the president, who are taking part in the officalist demo, unloading their pistols against the demonstrators as if they were playing a video game.
Sadly, amongst the people who are taking part in this march, we have not found any form of an answer. While the opposition wishes to kick out the current president, it does not seem to have in mind what should come after.
The only solution it seems to offer is a return to the old game of you-go-away-and-I-take-over, which makes any sort of change difficult. It is depressing to see how human beings can die in a struggle for power which will only serve to keep them under control.
As anarchists we are not for Chavez nor for any other president. We think that now more than ever our labour must show the people that the problem is not this president, or the one that will come after, but rather the vertical system of representative democracy. We must fight to show alternative systems of horizontal organisation, which, while it might not be put into practice on a large scale in the near future, will create a conscience so that in the future, instead of demonstrating to replace our tyrant, we will eliminate any type of governmental parasite forever, and begin to be each one of us the owner of our own lives. The way towards a libertarian world is process, not a single event.
a. By Acratic (4) individuals and collectives in Venezuela.
b. Neither the army nor right-wing businessmen!
c. Free and self-managed grassroots rebellion and organisation
(1) Meaning "no power," a term frequently used by Spanish-speaking anarchists to describe themselves.
(2) Literally, "the power of merits," as a guess, possibly s sort of productivity bonus scheme.
(3) Presumably the "Cmrculos Boliviarianos," the Venezuelan equivalence to the Cuban Revolutionary Defence Committees.
(4) The adjective used to describe "no power."

Venezuelan Generals Backing Interim President are SOA Grads
Army Commander in Chief Efrain Vasquez and General Ramirez Poveda, two of the major military backers of a transitional government, received training at the notorious US Army School of the Americas (SOA). Vasquez attended the school from January 23rd to December 2nd, 1988, taking a course called "Command and General Staff Officer Training". General Ramirez took a course called "Auto Maintenance Officer Training" from May 8th to August 11th, 1972.
With military backing, Pedro Carmona, president of business leaders association Fedecameras, has assumed the position of interim president.
The SOA, renamed in 2001 the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHISC), is a combat training school for Latin American soldiers, located at Fort Benning, Georgia. SOA graduates are consistently involved in human rights abuses and atrocities throughout Latin America.
SOA Watch is still researching, with concern, the events in Venezuela. The involvement of SOA trained militaries follows a clear pattern in Latin America. Former Congressperson Joseph Kennedy, stated "the US Army School of the Americas...is a school that has run more dictators than any other school in the history of the world." In total, the school has produced at least eleven Latin American dictators. Its graduates include, among others, Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, Major General Guillermo Rodriguez (who overthrew Ecuador's elected government and became dictator), Major General Juan Velasco (who did the same in Peru), Lieutenant General Roberto Viola and Lieutenant General Leopoldo Galtieri (responsible for Argentina's "Dirty War"), Bolivian General Hugo Banzer Suarez (who despite murdering labor leaders and opposition politicians and sheltering a Nazi war criminal, was honored as a member of the SOA Hall of Fame in 1988), Major General Guido Vildoso (military dictator of Bolivia), Brigadier General Juan Melgar Castro (military dictator of Honduras), and Josi Eframn Montt (dictator of Guatemala).
In an attempt to diffuse public criticism and to disassociate the school from its reputation the Pentagon renamed the SOA in 2001 the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. SOA Watch maintains that the underlying purpose of the school, to control the economic and political systems of Latin America through aiding and influencing Latin American militaries, remains the same.
SOA Watch, founded in 1990, is a national, grassroots conscience-based group committed to human rights and the promotion of democracy. With offices in Columbus, GA, Washington DC and chapters in communities and on campuses around the country, our goal is to work in solidarity with the people of Latin America and to close the SOA/WHISC.

@_subject: Amsterdam; tens of thousands on streets for palestine. 
Today I think at least 20-30 thousand people demonstrated for the liberation of the palestinian people. It was incredible. I arrived late from the biodiversity protests in The Hague fearing I missed the maybe a few thousand people I was expecting, only to arrive in a sea of palestina shawls that couldn't be contained by the Dam square. I don't usually care for numbers mutch but because of all the media lies you get to swallow you are thinking noone really cares, and this demonstration was only set up two weeks ago. People were from several dozens of cultures took part and I wasn't bored for a second! Most of the anarchists and squatters sticked with the less religious groups. The atmosphere was really relaxed, although a group of a hundred hezbollah supporters were very rude. Tension arose when police sealed off the area where the demo was planned to go, near the American and Israelian consulates. Also, police tried to confiscate banners stating things like 'sharon=hitler' because the mayor had decided that was antisemitic. An occasional window was broken but nothing really happened and a lot of people, some from the organisation and a lot spontaneously really tried to keep police and random troublemakers apart. When the march was forced to return to the Dam, some rioting started. Some people were burning an Israeli flag on one side of the square, while riot police were concentrated on the other, so they went in to a full charge, with a dozen horses as well, to reach the other side of the Dam going right through the middle of the demonstration trampling people, with elderly and children being there and all. So several hundred people, some of them to be honest waiting for the occasion, attacked riot police and Hotel Krasnapolski with rocks and sticks. People vented their anger and justly so, although for a lot of kids it was more a game, imitating intifada scenes and shouting jihad jihad, while they were often throwing stuff from behind others witch is always such a bloody stupid thing to do. While people from the organisation tried to calm people, they were often attacked as well by police, and were some journalists (and some journalists were attacked by activists so the scene got very confusing) After some time of relative calm police decided the demonstration would be ended and they would clear all the square. Snatch squads roamed around grabbing random Maroccan boys. Right in front of me riote police stormed in to a common drug store throwing down the shelves and dragging out a Morroccan guy who they threw to the ground and jumped upon and kept on beating him while he was down. A photographer making photo's next to me was then attacked but we managed to drag each other out of it with a few bruises. Dutch state tv of course mentioned a much lower numer of protesters, although tenthousand changed into thenthousands in the later bulletin. Of course, the main issue was the group of young troublemakers mostly from west-Amsterdam and Morroccan by origin. They were the most inflamed group and some were irritating threatening punks not to drink beer, but of course it isn't mentioned Amsterdam police absolutely hates them and takes up the least provocation to have a go at them. This was very inspiring for me. It was the largest protest since the EU summit in Amsterdam, 1997. I hope people in Palestine hear that there is so much solidarity in Amsterdam and Berlin, London, Rome, that we reject our crap government that's not undertaking anything against the violence. -- + We have a new PGP key -  + Vrienden van GroenFront! | EarthFirst!

Extract from Who wants to be president for a day?
Just such a power grab was predicted in a February 2002 Narco News article, which stated that "the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Morgan Stanley have come out in support of a 'transitional government' for Venezuela, supporting Chavez's removal from office."
After trying a coup in 1992, Chavez won the Venezuelan Presidency in 1998 and 2000, holding 57% of the votes on the last one. Since then Chavez became an "imposed leader" of the bolivarianos social movement and installed a "democracy" that annoyed not only IMF but also the oil oligarchy and the church. Using an enormous popularity Chavez had planned the bolivariana revolution to last until 2013 and implement an unprecedented number of reforms. He was openly opposed to FTAA and maintained a close friendship with Fidel Castro, assuring that Venezuela sell oil to Cuba at preferential prices. In other words, as "outside the whale" said in a comment posted to Indymedia, "Hugo pissed off the Oil Cos. The Oil Cos. conducted a coup. The Oil Cos. used media propaganda to provoke a civilian opposition. In short The Oil Cos. are in control not the people of Venezuela. Gee, Venezuela sounds kinda like America..." See also

The IRA has pulled off the most alarming intelligence coup in decades, managing to steal discs containing the names and addresses of every Special Branch officer, the codenames of informers and the information they supplied.
from : "The war in Ulster is over. The IRA just won."
by Kevin Myers.
Appeared in THE SUNDAY AGE (Melbourne), April 14,2002.
"On St. Patrick's night, March 17, a three-man raid on Castlereagh Special Branch headquarters achieved the greatest IRA penetration of British intelligence since 1920. The raiders' capture of vital computer disks constitutes a significant blow to the newly formed Police Service of Northern Ireland. Worse, it could well paralyse future intelligence-gathering operations."
"..And calamitous is the word. A vast body of lethally sensitive information has changed hands: the names and addresses of more than 250 serving and former members of Special Branch; the codenames of informers, and details of the information they have provided to the security services, all apparently only lightly encrypted, are on the captured disks. One security specialist went so far as to say: 'The war is over. And the IRA just won it.'"

Phil Zimmermann, the author of the popular PGP encryption program, was investigated by a Grand Jury for letting it `escape' to the Internet. The law was ridiculed by students wearing T-shirts printed with encryption source code (`Warning - this T-shirt is a munition!') and challenged in the courts as an affront to free speech.

'Britain is the biggest protector and nurturer of tax havens. Most are UK crown dependencies. Until the recent pressure from the OECD, the government has done little to reform them. On the domestic front, the government can levy taxes on the rich by estimating the income needed to maintain their lavish lifestyle. It can base corporate taxes on the estimated level of economic activity and market share enjoyed by corporations. It can refuse to provide government contracts to companies which abdicate their social responsibilities. It can abolish the farce of non-domiciled and non-resident tax status. But the major corporations have bought out the political system. The political will to tackle this major social abuse is missing.

PERSONAL OBSERVATION
I9ve always been interested in the use of the term monster9 and how the
term is used to describe people whose behaviour is so aberrant and
disgusting, that they are no longer considered to be human.  The monster in
folklore, is always somebody whose physical appearance sets them apart from
the human race.  The monster becomes the other, the threat from over the
hill, another country or another planet.
Human history is littered with examples of people, whose relationships with
other human beings, is so perverse they have been labelled as monsters.  Pol
Pot, Adolf Hitler and Stalin are three 20th century monsters that are
trotted out with monotonous regularity.  Anybody who follows what9s
happening in the Middle East knows that monsters come in all shapes and
sizes.  The monster9 has been used and continues to be used to describe
cruelty that seems to be beyond human comprehension.  By describing somebody
as a monster, we feel we don9t need to describe their behaviour in human
The thing about human monsters9 that everybody forgets, is that they are
first and foremost human and they belong to the human family.  We can9t
continue to ignore why they behave in this manner.  The monster is a product
of human ideology and hierarchical structures.  It9s no accident that the
greater the monster, the greater control they have over people.  Pol Pot,
Hitler, Stalin and Kissinger would have been quaint eccentrics if they
didn9t wield State power.  The more centralised and hierarchically
structured a society, the greater the potential to create monsters who will
use all the power at their disposal, to shape the world in their image.
Monsters look, and on the surface behave like other human beings.  If I put
Hitler, Kissinger, Pol Pot and Stalin in the same room and didn9t know what
they looked like, no one would be able to pick who is and who isn9t a
monster.  Some of the great monsters of the 20th century have been urbane,
sophisticated and witty individuals who were the life of the party.  Their
transformation into monsters has occurred as they begin to wield more power.
Anarchists realise we all have the potential to become monsters, that9s why
we want to break down the hierarchical structures that place ultimate power
in the hands of one person.AND
ALL THE NEWS THAT FITS Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed part-time workers represented by unions earned 43 per cent more than their non-unionised counterparts. The data showed all union members on average earned 15 per cent more than non-unionised employees. Casuals and female union employees also had better earnings if they were in unions. Union members working in accommodation, cafes, restaurants, transport, storage and education earned on average mor e than 30 per cent extra than non-union members in their industries. Other ABS figures measuring union density indicate that union membership might be stablising after years of decline. - Australian Financial Review The US government has drafted secret plans to wage nuclear war against seven countries as well as building an arsenal of smaller nuclear devices for use in battlefield situations. A classified Pentagon report has warned that the US must be ready to use nuclear weapons against China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria and also in an Arab-Israeli conflict. The report, provided to Congress in January and signed by US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, said weapons could be used in 3 types of situations. The first was against targets able to withstand non-nuclear attack, the second in retaliation for attack with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The third was simply "in the event of surprising military developments". - The Observer. Originally reported in the Los Angeles Times. Ali Asqar Bakhtiyari's wife and five children, aged 5 to 13, were refused visas after the Refugee Review Tribunal refused to believe their claims that they are Afghan refugees.

AUSTRALIAN RADICAL HISTORY
THE EUREKA SERIES Nos. 10
TWO TRIALS
After a number of mass meetings and the burning down of the Eureka Hotel,
James Bentley the republican who was initially cleared of any involvement in
the death of the miner James Scobie, appeared in the Victorian Supreme Court
to face a charge of murder.  Catherine Bentley (his wife), John Farrel the
former Castlemaine Police Magistrate and a barman at the Eureka Hotel,
William Hance, were also charged with the same murder.   Catherine Bentley
was acquitted but James Bentley, Farrel and Hance were found guilty of
manslaughter and were sentenced to three years hard labour, a relatively
light sentence for the times.
Of the ten people who were randomly arrested from the 10,000 miners who were
at the Eureka Hotel rally when it burned down, three were committed to stand
trial for the fire.  Andrew McIntyre, Thomas Fletcher and Henry Westerby
were charged with rioting and burning down the Eureka Hotel.  After a
spirited defence by their lawyer Richard Ireland, the jury retired and
returned five hours later with a guilty verdict, but made a strong
recommendation for mercy.  The jury stated that the defendants would not
have found themselves in court on these charges, if the authorities had done
their duty and charged Bentley with murder in the first place.  The judge
gave the defendants prison sentences, ranging from three to six months.
The arbitrary nature of the arrests and the prison sentences, further
infuriated the Ballarat miners, confirming their suspicions that the courts
always acted in favour of those with power and wealth (seems little has
changed nearly a hundred and fifty years later).
Governor Hotham9s role in the court cases was questioned by the miners.  It
was felt that Hotham9s words were not matched by his deeds and he was acting
"like a martinet".  The people were crying out for land, representation and
justice, and all they continued to receive was increasingly costly miner9s
licences and more frequent licence hunts.  Faced with an almost empty
treasury and a potentially hostile population, Hotham fanned, not
extinguished the flames of discontent.  He retrenched over a 1000 public
servants and asked the Gold Commissioners to increase the licence hunts and
collect every penny owed to the State.  As the tensions rose, rumours
abounded and Governor Hotham realised that he was faced with a potentially
insurrectionary situation and needed to send more troops to maintain order
and collect licence fees on the goldfields.
  BOOK REVIEW
MASSACRE AT EUREKA - The Untold Story
Bob O9Brien, 1st Published 1992, The Sovereign Hill Museums Association
1998 Edition, ISBN 0 909 874 190
Massacre at Eureka is O9Brien9s second book.  The author has been involved
in radio and television broadcasting and lives at Clunes near Ballarat.
Friends have told me he is currently in poor health and is not expecting to
live long.  Bob had always been interested in what happened at Eureka and in
the 19809s gathered material for this book.  The material he discovered
conclusively shows that the Eureka Rebellion was a massacre.  Of the 120
miners in the stockade, around 25% were killed, most after they surrendered.
Massacre at Eureka uses source material that has never been published
before.  After a short introduction by Victoria9s State Historian Bernard
Barrett and the author, the book opens up with an eyewitness account written
by Samuel Huyghue the chief clerk of Robert Rede, the resident commissioner
and officer in charge of the Ballarat goldfields.  Huyghue9s sympathetic
account of the rebellion forms the backbone of the book.  Huyghue9s account
was written on his retirement in 1884.
The rest of the book is divided into eleven chapters, the most interesting
is chapter 7 - Contemporary Views Of The Massacre.  In chapter 7, Peter
Lalor the leader of the rebellion and Raffaello Carboni a prominent
participant tell their stories.  While a letter from the Victorian Governor
General Charles Hotham to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London
and a letter from Captain John Wellersley the Captain Commanding the troops
of Ballarat, outlines the State9s story.
Chapter 8 - The Stockaders, has some interesting accounts by relatives of
those who took part in the rebellion.  William Atherden, one of the 114
arrested, was possibly the last survivor of the Eureka Stockade.  He died at
the age of 96 in May 1934, 80 years after the rebellion.
Massacre at Eureka is more a collection of other people9s accounts than a
real book.  Its strength lies in O9Brien9s research abilities.  Through
diligent pain staking research, he has been able to find accounts by
participants who have been ignored by other researchers and authors.  The
1998 edition is attractively presented in this easy to read 178-page account
of the Eureka Rebellion.
The book is available for $27.50 (Australian) from: The Sovereign Hill

@_subject: ANARCHIST Q+A: Are anarchists terrorists? 
ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER Q: Are anarchists terrorists? A: One of the most enduring myths about anarchists is that they are terrorists. When you examine the history of anarchism over the past 200 years, it9s hard to find examples of anarchist terrorism. Why has this myth endured for so long? The answer can be found in the nature of anarchism and the ruling class9s responses to the challenges it poses. Anarchism is based on the principle of replacing a ruler9s right to make decisions and hold wealth, with the right of the people to make their own decisions and share wealth. We live in societies that are based on the right of rulers whether elected, hereditary or appointed to make decisions. Most people find it impossible to envisage life without rulers and find it difficult to image that an anarchist society wouldn9t degenerate into a dog eat dog world, believing that the only thing that saves them from chaos is a ruler9s ability to maintain order by asserting their authority. Another reason the myth is so powerful is that at the very moment that anarchism became a moral, social and political force, it posed a challenge to the status quo in European sections of the anarchist movement, that began to follow a policy of propaganda by the deed. This strategy targeted European rulers for assassination. The special conditions in France saw a few activists, who called themselves anarchists, expand this particular strategy to include the French bourgeoisie. After the failure of the 1871 Paris Commune, one in ten of the 500,000 Communards captured, were executed by the occupying forces to teach the European working class a lesson they would never forget. Twenty five years later, the sons and daughters of executed and exiled Communards who wanted revenge for the extra judicial murder of their relatives, used the strategy of propaganda by the deed, as the intellectual and moral basis for their actions. The public backlash created by a media dominated by ruling class interests during this period, saw the anarchist movement rapidly abandon the strategy of propaganda by the deed. The stigma attached to anarchists continues to exist in the public mind because in the popular imagination, anarchism was successfully linked with terrorism because of the threat this new movement posed to ruling class interests in Europe in the 18909s. When you compare the daily atrocities committed by the State, corporations, religious, political and nationalist groups with the few documented terrorist acts committed by anarchists over the past century, it9s blatantly obvious that anarchism is one of the few political ideologies that does not use terror. When you examine both past and present history, anarchists have been the victims of State, corporate and communist terror campaigns. Over the past hundred years, tens of thousands of anarchists have been imprisoned, tortured and killed because they had the audacity to attempt to make that new world in their hearts - a society where people ruled themselves and used property in common into a reality.

@_subject: Justice system in Victoria (au) in disrepute. 
MISUSE OF PROCESS When government talks about civil society, it makes a great song and dance about due process. Any society that claims it follows the rule, of law relies on due process - a series of steps that ensures that everybody in that society is treated equally and fairly by that countries legal system. Misuse of due process is a crime that brings both government and the legal system into disrepute. The struggle over the destruction of the Goolengook State forest by the Victorian State government and the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, is not only an environmental and economic disaster, it9s an attack on due process. The Victorian State government is cynically misusing due process to destroy some of the most magnificent old growth forests in this country. The State government and the Department are stopping people from entering the forest by claiming that a fifteen kilometer exclusion zone exists around the Goolengook forest. Exclusion zones on public land cannot be legally created unless a private lease exists on that land, no private leases exist in the Goolengook State forest and surrounding public land. This so called exclusion zone has been created to give officers of the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, the authority to arrest "trespassers" in this zone. When those arrested are brought before the courts, they are normally given a bail condition that prevents them from returning to the exclusion zone. The current misuse of due process is a cynical attempt by both the State government and the Department to illegally stop protestors from saving this precious corner of Victoria. While their cases wait to go to courts, forestry contractors under the protection of the department, are destroying what9s left of the Goolengook State forests. This cynical and calculated misuse of due process, not only belittles the Brack's Labor government in the eye of the electorate, it also places the whole justice system in Victoria in disrepute.

BAJ protests detention of thirteen journalists
April 8, Radio Racyja
Police in the western Belarusian city of Grodno on Friday detained 13
journalists, who stood up to protest criminal prosecution against two
journalists - Mikola Markevich and Paval Mazeika - from the local private
newspaper Pahonia, closed down by the authorities last November. The Grodno
journalists - most of them being members of the Belarusian Association of
Journalists staged three unauthorized pickets in support of their colleagues
under the slogans: "Hands Off Markevich and Mazeika", "I Write The Truth
About President, Too. Am I Next?"
Mikola Markevich and Paval Mazeika are set to appear in court on Tuesday, 9
April on charges of slander against the Belarus president.
Picket organizers had filed several applications to the local authorities
requesting authorization to stage pickets, but the city administration
rejected them all in breach of the Constitutional provisions which guarantee
the right to freedom of expression. By having banned the pickets,
authorities took up responsibility for the further development of the
During the pickets the following journalists were detained:
Andrzej Pisalnik (Dien), Iryna Cherniavko (Belaruski Chas), Vitaut Rudnik
(Thrid Sector magazine), Andrei Meleshka (Nasha Niva), Andrej Pachobut (Glos
z nad Niemna), Alena Sinevich (Radio Racyja Bialystok) , Andrzej Kusjalcuk
(freelancer), Julia Doroshkevich (Pahonia), Alexander Dvoretskov
(freelancer), Alesia Sidliarevich (Pahonia), Olga Artemenko (Birza
Infarmacyji), Dmitry Egorov (Barcnews), Stas Pachobut (Navinki).
On Friday night nearly all detainees were subjected to administrative
prosecution, receiving terms in jail or fines. Dmitry Egorov and Vitaut
Rudnik - 3 days of arrest; Alexander Dvorestkov - 4 days of arrest; Stas
Pachobut and Andrzej Pisalnik - 10 days of arrest; Andrei Meleshko - 8 days
of arrest. Irina Cherniavka and Alena Sinevich were fined to 30 and 20
minimum salaries, correspondingly. Olga Artemenko and Andrzej Pachobut
received warnings. Stas Pachobut went on a hunger-strike. Other journalists
will be tried today, 8 April.
The Belarusian Association of Journalists expressed decisive protest against
administrative prosecution of journalists, emphasising that Article 33 in
Belarus Constitution clearly sets out that everyone shall be guaranteed the
freedom of opinion, believes and their free expression. The freedom of
assembly, street rallies, demonstrations and pickets is set forth in Article
35 of Belarus Constitution. Article 21 in the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, to which Belarus is a party, recognizes the
right to peaceful assemblies.
BAJ protested against the continued pattern of attacks on the freedom of
expression by the authorities in Belarus, and appealed to international
community to join the protest.

'Hacktivists' rage against the machine
By Jenny Sinclair
April 9 2002
 From a stone farmhouse in west Wales to a home in France, the cyber activists are fighting globalisation - or at least the commercial kind.
"The Hacktivists", a documentary screening on ABC TV on Thursday, May 2 uses the lead-up to an anti-globalisation protest in Canada to frame the lives of computer activists around the world, including the Electronic Disturbance Theatre and the Federation of Random Action.
One US security analyst and academic compares the "hacktivists" to swarms of insects that can overwhelm much larger targets.
Virtual sit-ins are shown as natural extensions of street protests but the show glosses over the possibility that some of the traffic in these sit-ins might be from unwilling participants, victims of hacking and back-door programs that take over their computers.
The show meets the makers of FloodNet, the automated Web attack software used in solidarity with the Zapatista revolutionaries to flood the Mexican president's home page. It also interviews the people behind the attack on the eToys website by supporters of existing "art" group eToy Corporation. The segment, with descriptions of "virtual shopper" soldiers wrecking the online business, shows just how effective these tools can be.
Set up against these activists are types like Ben Venzske, a cyber private eye who cruises the dark corners of the Net on behalf of corporations fearful of becoming targets of an organised attack.
Cyber wars and events occurring over distributed networks are not best suited to the medium of television, and the first half is a little heavy on the mood music and moody profile shots of hackers. It improves when the Canadian action is under way, with activists reporting live from the street.
"Are these boys who want toys, or are these humans who want a better society?" asks one activist. A bit of each, probably.
The show claims that the cyber activists and their street equivalents are becoming a serious threat to globalisation; it underplays the abilities of their targets to rise to the challenge if they deem it necessary.

Military police tear-gas Vieques protesters
  posted by Drew on Sunday April 07 2002 @ 07:46PM PDT
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico- Military police detained a nun and an Episcopal priest for trespassing on restricted land on Saturday and used tear gas on about 50 people demonstrating against U.S. Navy bombing on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
So far, 14 people have been arrested for trespassing on Navy property since the exercises began last Monday. Navy officials confirmed the arrest Saturday of the nun and priest, who protesters identified as Carmen Gonzalez Arias and Pablo Maysonett Marrero.
The destroyer USS Mahan and the guided missile frigate USS Barry conducted ship-to-shore military training on Saturday.
Navy spokesman Lt. Corey Barker said exercises involving the USS George Washington Battle Group will resume on Monday.
A protest involving about 50 people at one of the camps established by demonstrators near the front gate of the Camp Garcia military reservation was interrupted on Saturday by Navy security personnel shooting gas canisters from within the restricted zone.
Despite contrary eyewitness accounts, Barker said CS gas spray was launched on Saturday after protesters threw "rocks and debris at Navy vehicles."
When told rock throwing occurred after Navy security dispersed the crowd with gas, he added: "If there is an imminent danger that the crowd is going to throw rocks or break down the fence, then gas will be sprayed to disperse the crowd. Gas is used to disperse a threatening crowd."
Demonstrators were observed taunting the sailors before the gas was used. After the crowd was dispersed, a few protesters came back and threw rocks, prompting Navy personnel to fire more gas.
A barbed-wire fence and a line of Puerto Rican police officers separated the military security personnel from protesters, who included members of the National Puerto Rican Coalition, a group of Puerto Rican political and civic leaders from the United States making a one-day visit to the island.
Fleeing from gas
Dozens of protesters and journalists fled the gas, and at least two people affected by the gas were treated at a local clinic, protesters said.
Two Puerto Rico officials said the Navy reaction was too strong.
"They are provoking the situation," Police Col. Cesar Gracia said of the Navy security personnel, adding that reports of rock-throwing by protesters were false.
"I witnessed the incident, and there was no rock-throwing. Right now, my superiors are on the phone to complain to the Navy about the situation," Gracia said.
Juan Fernandez, the commonwealth government's special commissioner charged with overseeing Navy military exercises, said he believes security on Camp Garcia has been increased and that security personnel have been given orders to take a firmer approach against trespassers and protesters.
"They are using exaggerated, unnecessary force and violating people's constitutional rights," he said, adding he would make a formal complaint to Navy officials.
Commonwealth officials are also complaining that military officials are unnecessarily using pepper spray and aggressive treatment against trespassers arrested on Navy property.
Ismael Gonzalez, a 67-year-old retired warehouse worker from Camuy, one of three trespassers arrested on Friday, needed medical attention after hitting his head on a rock while being detained. Barker said the incident was being investigated.
Barker, who declined comment on security levels on Vieques, said training had not been interrupted by protests this week.

During 2001, at least 3,048 people were put to death in 31 countries, the sharp increase largely the result of a Chinese crack-down on crime which saw the world's most populous nation execute nearly 1,800 people in four months, Amnesty said.
The human rights group said in a statement many of those condemned to death could have been tortured to extract confessions, and the total number of executions could be far higher since many killings were deliberately kept ``Many cases were in blatant violation of international standards on the application of the death penalty,'' Amnesty said, calling for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, sitting in Geneva, to establish a moratorium on all executions.
China executed a total of 2,468 people, more than all other countries put together, while Iran's 139 recorded executions probably fell short of the true number of people put to death, Amnesty said.
In oil-rich Saudi Arabia, 79 executions were reported along with a multitude of amputations and floggings, while in the United States 66 people lost their lives at the hands of the state, down from 85 the previous year.
``The figures for China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United States accounted for 90 percent of all known executions in 2001,'' Amnesty said.
Chile abolished the death penalty in 2001 for peacetime offences and Turkey adopted constitutional amendments to limit its scope, but overall the practice does not seem to be on the wane -- Amnesty said over 5,000 people were sentenced to death during the year, compared to 3,058 in 2000.

ANARCHIST AND ANTI-MILITARIST SECTION IN THE MARCH AGAINST THE ARMS EXPO (EXA), BRESCIA 13th APRIL 2002
EXA, or the "Brescia Arms Expo" has been held in the town of Brescia since 1979. This expo claims to be a "pacific" exposition of sports arms (clay-pigeon shooting), hunting arms (as if that were a sport) and arms for collectors. But a large majority of the exhibiting companies produce and sell arms for war, small calibre arms and anti-riot equipment (tear gas, rubber bullets etc.) - chief among them being Beretta. Among them are many international exhibitors, the real titans among weapons producers, like Browning, Colt, Winchester...
It is estimated that there are something like between 500 million and 1 billion small arms throughout the world and that $50m, the cost of a fighter jet, would be enough to arm a small army with 200,000 assault rifles. These weapons are easy to use and maintain, in fact easy enough for a child of 10 to use - over 250,000 children under the age of 18 have taken part in 33 of of the most recent armed struggles, and in 26 of these even children under the age of 15 have taken part.
Neither should we forget those arms which are hypocritically categorized as non-lethal, but whose lethal nature has been experienced above all for internal control - for the repression of demonstrations and marches, in prisons etc. Among these instruments of death and torture we can count tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons, anti-personnel mines, acoustic arms (which can emits waves of 170 decibels, enough to damage organs), electric batons etc...
This is why it is important to continue in a determined manner not only the anti-war struggle, but also the anti-militaristic struggle.
We cannot stop war unless at the same time we impede the basis of war - the production and trade of arms (the banks which act as go-between), the armies, the states and capitalism together with every form of hierarchy, coercion and subordination.
Therefore, we accept the invitation on the part of the "E. Bonometti" Anarchist Circle to create an anarchist, anti-militarist section in the march which will take place on Saturday 13th April 2002 in Brescia against the EXA Fair.
THE MARCH LEAVES PIAZZA REPUBBLICA (100m. FROM THE RAILWAY STATION) AT 2.00pm.
We invite all anarchist groups, federated and otherwise, to participate in the demonstration and to support this appeal.

World Bank to West Bank
'The movement to which many of the peace activists risking their lives in Ramallah and Bethlehem belong has no name. Some people have called it an anti-globalisation or anti-corporate or anti-capitalist campaign. Others prefer to emphasise its positive agenda, calling it a democracy or internationalist movement. But, because they have always put practice first and theory second, its members have proved impossible to categorise. Whenever it appears to have assumed an identity outsiders believe they can grasp, it morphs into something else. It is driven by a new, responsive politics, informed not by ideology but by need. After September 11, this nameless thing appeared to vanish as swiftly as it had emerged.... But those who dismissed it had failed to grasp either the seriousness of its intent or the breadth of its support. The television cameras always focused on a few hundred young men dressed in black and running riot, intercut occasionally with the wider carnival of protest. But they seldom permitted its participants to explain the sense of purpose which propelled them. So most outsiders failed to see that the commitment of many of the people involved in these protests is non-negotiable. The movement is no more likely to go away than the governments and corporations it confronts. Its survival is assured by its ability to become whatever it needs to be' ( George Monbiot via Guardian )

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced the shortlist of architects to participate in a design competition for new permanent immigration detention facilities.
The list comprises Sinclair Knight Merz Pty Limited & Crone Associates (Vic) Pty Limited, Phillips Smith Conwell Architects Pty Ltd, Codd Stenders Pty Ltd and a consortium comprising Guymer Bailey Architects, Sinclair Knight Merz and Peter Hunt Architects.
Mr Ruddock added that the development of new detention facilities is a great opportunity for the Government to advance the quality and style of detention facilities in Australia.
"It also provides an opportunity for architectural organisations participating in the design process to showcase their talents and potentially earn international recognition in an environment where the illegal movement of people around the world is a growing international problem," Mr Ruddock said.
"I look forward to the results of the competition and wish all participants well," Mr Ruddock said.

There's never been a child who's went to school, took out a porno tape, and beat the crap out of somebody and killed them. But they go and take guns to school. And the Republicans make sure that there's no waiting list on gun shows. "Oh, you can't have a waiting list. We're business." (Laughs.) OK. There's not even a two-day waiting period to go buy a gun at a gun show. That's all right. But pornography, abortion -- God forbid those things.

@_subject: William Harvey;A great american without honor. 
April 8, 2002 | The crowd surrounded William Harvey. They cursed him, they told him to get the fuck out -- about 20 men and women on a street where you could smell the rubble of the fallen towers. The disaster was just a block away. William Harvey did not move. He held a sign that showed a picture of the World Trade Center and the face of Osama bin Laden hovering, superimposed. Harvey tried to hand out leaflets. He told the crowd: "America is getting paid back for what it's doing to Islamic countries."
"Fuck this guy, lock that fucking guy up before I kill him!" yelled one man, and a chorus of obscenity followed. Their faces turned ugly, and still William Harvey stood his ground, even as the crowed swelled to over 60 people and spilled into the street. Traffic came to a halt; horns blared, sirens sounded. The police showed up, elbowed in, surveyed the situation and arrested the offending parties -- William Harvey and his leaflets. Incredibly, Harvey was charged with disorderly conduct, though he apparently did nothing more than speak his mind.
That was Oct. 4, 2001, when the wounds from Sept. 11 were still fresh. Harvey now faces a criminal trial in Manhattan because he pissed off a lot of freedom-loving people who didn't like the fact that he had the freedom to speak his mind. Of course, the case should have been thrown out immediately on free speech grounds, but in the post-9/11 bizarro world, patriotism trumps the First Amendment.
Consider the 9/11-inflected opinion of the judge who struck down Harvey's motion to dismiss in mid-February. "The defendant chose to disseminate his message at a location near Ground Zero at a time shortly after Sept. 11," wrote Judge Neil Ross of the Criminal Court of the City of New York. "[A]t the very least, he was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm would Judge Ross then went on to stretch himself very thin. He argued that the charge of disorderly conduct is generally defined by "the reaction which speech engenders, not the content of the speech. The angry, threatening of the large crowd that stopped to read this defendant's message" created a volatile situation. This is a ridiculous line, and it upholds the patently unconstitutional argument known as the "hecklers veto." If someone doesn't like what you're saying, and commits a crime as a result, your speech is liable and you go to jail.
Not surprisingly, free speech advocates are rallying to Harvey's cause. "The Harvey case is a threat to the First Amendment and it cannot be allowed to stand," says Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "It's wrong in the law, it's wrong in the precedent and it defies logic. It would rewrite unpopular speech out of the Constitution." FROM

THUMBS UP! OBSCENITY CASE SETTLES!
VAN NUYS (3.20.02) - Adam Glasser, aka Seymore Butts, announced today that he and his attorney, Roger Diamond, have reached a settlement with the city attorneys office regarding the obscenity charges filed against Glassers' companies in March of 2001. Glassers' offices were raided in December of 2000 after an anonymous complaint was received by the city attorneys office about a fisting scene in the movie "Tampa TushyFest Part 1".
The terms of the agreement follows
One of Glassers' companies, BBE Inc., would plead guilty to a public nuisance charge and pay a $1000 fine to a victim's restitution fund. The company will not be put on probation.
Glasser will agree to offer an edited "fisting free" version to every customer in California.
All materials confiscated from Glassers' companies will be returned.
All other charges on Adam Glasser, Lila Glasser, BBE Inc., and Seymore Inc. will be dismissed.
After signing the paper work and handing over a check to the city attorney Glasser had this to say
"I am relieved its over and extremely satisfied with the outcome. I told Roger from the onset that I wanted him to be as aggressive as possible in defending this case. I told him I believed there was nothing obscene about this movie and was willing to take the matter to trial if necessary. I am glad to see that the new city attorney, Rocky Delgadiallo, who inherited this case from his predecessor, took the time to review the matter and make the proper decision. I also applaud him for deciding to review their do's and don'ts list in regards to sex acts depicted in adult materials. Since the list they were working off was written in 1981, I think its about time!
As for the settlement itself, we have always offered an unedited version of this movie to customers in more conservative states.
So for us, everything remains status quo except now we know we are legally allowed to sell the unedited version here in California. All in all, I think its a great day for the adult industry, the free speech movement and especially all the millions of consumers who enjoy their rights to watch the adult entertainment of their choice!"

@_subject: Castle Wolfensen;boycott their bonds and bankrupt them. 
"...Many activists began to think then that, after the blip of 11 September, world events were still moving their way. Some among them saw the need to push the movement beyond the now familiar scenes of protests and riots. They decided, in fact, to bankrupt the World Bank.
It might sound far-fetched. The bank, after all, is a huge global operation. It is owed $2.5trn by developing countries and employs 10,000 people worldwide. In 1997, it extracted $1bn more from Africa than it lent to the continent.
But who owns the World Bank? We do. Ordinary people in the west - through their trade unions, churches, town councils, universities and private investments - own the bank, but they don't know that. The bank raises nearly all its funds by issuing bonds on the private market. These are often held by socially minded institutions that would be horrified to think they were propping up an ultra-neoliberal organisation.
So activists have come up with a simple way of breaking the bank: boycott their bonds and bankrupt them.
Dennis Brutus, a patron of Jubilee 2000 South Africa and a founder member of the new campaign, has been told many times before that boycotts achieve nothing. He heard people say it when he was a prisoner on Robben Island and was pleading for the world to boycott South African goods. He is unashamed in drawing a direct parallel: "We need to break the power of the World Bank over developing countries," he explains, "as the disinvestment movement helped break the power of the apartheid regime in South Africa."

Message received by Statewatch: 28.3.02: "The MET police have been threatening to raid website hosts who have tried to host the website for this years "May Day Festival of Alternatives". The content of what should be available at  is information about the 2002 "May Day Festival of Alternatives". Running from 16th April - May 6th, the programme of events mostly includes music performances, film screenings, and workshops on a variety of issues and diy skill sharing, as well as ideas for protests on 1 May itself. The website should have 'gone live' last month, however at least 3 different website hosts who agreed to host the site have been quickly approached by police, when the domain name 'ourmayday.org.uk' has been pointed at their servers. MET Police have either contacted the hosts by phone or in person, demanding to know all of the personal details of the people behind the 'ourmayday' website. The MET Police have also told the hosts they must remove the site (or not to host it) or be faced with a police raid during which their web servers would be seized. The Police have not said under what legislation they are making these demands and threats. As a result of the police threats the webhosts have so far declined to host the website. Recently the website was temporarily hosted on a German website, but soon after the whole server which also hosts many other websites 'went down' and has not been restored. At this time it is not known if this is connected to British police activity. Appeals have now been made for other servers to host the website. NB: Text on the website and on May Day leaflets says: "This Mayday we are responding to the frequently asked question 'What are you for? What do you actually want?' We aim to show our goals of creating a society based on solidarity, autonomy and co-operation - in practice. We want to show that there is a future beyond capitalism, wage-labour and the state;" "The Festival will consist of around 10 days of community-based events aiming at celebration, subversion and DIY liberation; and to demonstrate the diversity of our movement, with the intention of building long-range sustained alternatives." "The Mayday Festival of Alternatives is inspired by a month of dissident art/culture events in France, held last year in response to the irrelevance and media saturation of the General Election 2001." Planned workshops throughout the Festival of Alternatives include: *Allotments *Wildlife garden projects *Asylum *Biodiversity and food security *Clothes making *Desktop publishing *Feminist History *Film Showings *Flamenco *Gender *GM monoculture *Shiatsu *Journalism *Sweatshop labour *Nuclear issues *Climate Change *Social Centres *Squatting *Plumbing *Tree climbing *What is Anarchism? *Yoga NB Recent public meetings about the Festival have been subject to police surveillance with people attending being filmed and photographed."

And of course Yasser Arafat is simply not in control of the many arms of the Palestinian resistance.

Italy 1977
Italy 1977 saw a spontaneous and creative outbreaks of rebellion
demonstrating that the potential for revolution still exists in the working
class of the industrialised west - no matter what the leftie cynics say.
Tension built up throughout 1976 with the growth of autonomi (groups
outside traditional left / Union formations) and the Circollo Del
Proletariato Giovanile (Circles of Proletarian Youth), both strong in the
slum areas of the great northern industrial cities. They developed many
confrontational tactics directly linked to working class needs. The most
successful was autoriduzione (self-reduction), where price rises in
essential commodities were not paid, or communities decided a fair price.
Direct sabotage of capitalist property was also popular  blowing their
cars up, beating up particularly authoritarian bosses, or refusing to let
them enter the factories. These tactics grew in popularity, worrying both
the leftists and the capitalists, as all relations of dominance were
brought into question.
Things blew up in Bologna in early 1977, when Lama, the leader of the
Stalinist CGIL Union went to the University to lecture members of the
Circollo and Autonomi (who used it as a base) and students, arguing they
should join the Communist Party. He was chased from the building, and only
saved from serious harm by his security team and the cops he had brought
with him. The University head called in cops to restore order, sparking off
a fierce battle leading to the occupation of all the university facilities,
which became the focus for workers and students meeting (as in Paris 1968).
This soon developed into larger public manifestations, culminating in the
physical capture of Bologna for three days in March, following the shooting
of a demonstrator. An eyewitness wrote that Downtown, numerous shops and
luxury restaurants were looted; side by side with young proletarians, old
pensioners could be seen fleeing happily, pushing handcarts full of
delicacies. For once in these streets and squares people were
communicatingover the next few days police found scores of guns and rifles
hidden in improbable places, the fruit of an armoury raid. Similar
episodes occurred in Rome, Milan and Turin. Radio Alice was set up, and
broadcast the movements of police and troops, which helped extend the
occupation. Eventually the movement was repressed, with all the political
parties working hand in hand with the judiciary, but the lesson remains 
anything is possible!

One of the darkest yet least-known chapters of postwar
Asian history  the horrific genocide of 30,000 innocent
civilians on Cheju-do between 1948 & 1949.
In the space of one year, fully 10% of the island's total

intelligence at the time that 60,000 were killed.

was undertaken by the South Korean army, the Cheju-do police,

In today's trial Turkish anarchist prisoners are released by the decision of Izmir SSC (State Security Court). The next trial is postponed to 21st of May. On 1st of December 2001, 5 people from Usak were arrested with the claim of being members of "Usak Anarsist Otonomu" while 3 of them were distributing their own leaflets during a trade-union demo. They are being judged according to Article No. 3713/7 which defines "illegal political gangs". Although they were just claimed to be responsible for a number of graffities and a leaflet titled "No to Capitalism and War!" signed as Usak Anarsist Otonomu, 4 of them were forced to spend 2 months in F type cells-where they lived 2 by 2. Today's trial started at noon and lasted more than an hour. Except prisoner's families, anarchists from Izmir and Istanbul, representatives from DISK (a leftist syndicate) were also present at the court. Among the lawyers of the anarchists there were the Chairman of Izmir Lawyer Association and lawyer of Bergama peasants. According to the report of SSC Attorney, Usak Anarsist Otonomu were claimed to be a part of AGF-Anarsist Genclik Federasyonu (Anarchist Youth Federation) and according to the information report of Turkish Pigs (Police) Tayfun Gvn|l were said to be the "leader" of anarchists in Turkey!! Tayfun Gvn|l attending the court as a "witness" rejected all of the claims and stated that the related group (AGF) is a group of people from Istanbul and added that even AGF itself does not define itself as an "organization"-they say AGF is their "life". T. Gvn|l also told he was never arrested or questioned as a member of AGF; as he was born in 1958 it was impossible for him to be a member of a youth group! He stated that since the beginning of anarchist movement in Turkey Turkish anarchists had never organized an armed or violent action and this attitude is consciouos. Later with reference to the offer of lawyers and the SSC Attorney the court decided the release of 4 anarchists (Muammer Vzg|r K|g|ktekin, Ahmet Serkan Tomar, Sabri Serkan Kazak, Onur Ayaz and Rahmi Tiril) who were in Izmir Kaynaklar F type prison for about two months. (Sabri Serkan Kazak were released on 13th of February) The next trial will be on 21st of May. (3.4.2002) Thanx to all comrades for their solidarity!

RELEASE DATE: THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 2002
Leonard Peltier Defense Committee (785) 842-5774;
NATIVE AMERICAN ACTIVIST FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST FBI
Former FBI Director Louis Freeh is named as a defendant in a lawsuit
filed today by attorneys for imprisoned Native American activist, Leonard
Peltier. Freeh, along with the FBI Agents Association and a long list of
active FBI agents, are accused of violating Peltier's Constitutional rights
by making false and unsupported statements to the public, the Department of
Justice, the United States Parole Commission, and former President Clinton.
The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court, Washington D.C., alleges that
the FBI "engaged in a systematic, and officially sanctioned campaign of
mis-information and dis-information" designed to prevent Peltier from
receiving fair clemency and parole reviews.
The suit follows a highly controversial campaign conducted by
the FBI to stop former president Bill Clinton from issuing Peltier a grant
of executive clemency during his last days in office. FBI agents across the
nation submitted letters to the editor, sponsored major newspaper and radio
ads, and marched by the hundreds in front of the White House to discourage
clemency. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote searing letters to Bill
Clinton and Janet Reno, to urge against Peltier's release. The campaign,
which gained national attention, characterized Peltier as a cold-blooded
killer who brutally shot two FBI agents at point blank range. Peltier's
attorneys and supporters assert that this characterization is not only false
but intentionally deceptive given the government's long held position that
it cannot prove who shot the agents. Furthermore, they say it cost Peltier,
now 57 years of age and in poor health, his long deserved freedom.
Peltier has served more than 26 years in prison for the deaths
of two FBI agents killed in a 1975 shoot-out on the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation. Peltier's supporters claim the FBI terrorized witnesses,
utilized false testimony and withheld a ballistic test proving Peltier's
innocence to gain his conviction. Senior Eighth Circuit Judge Gerald
Heaney, who denied Peltier a new trial based on a legal technicality, has
since come forward to support Peltier's release, citing FBI misconduct.
Amnesty International, the Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, Rev.
Jesse Jackson, Rigoberta Menchu Tum, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Corretta Scott
King, and scores of Native tribes are among those who consider Peltier a
political prisoner who should be freed.

@_subject: Anarchist Q+A.How to deal with psychiatric illness. 
ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER
Q: How would an anarchist society deal with people with psychiatric
A: One in four people will develop a psychiatric disorder within their
lifetime.  One in ten of the 25% of the population who develop a psychiatric
illness will develop an illness that puts them or the community at a serious
risk.  Anarchism as a political and social philosophy has a poor track
record of dealing with people with major psychiatric problems.  Many
anarchists believe that psychiatric illness is a direct result of a
situational crisis and in an anarchist community, psychiatric illness will
not be a problem.  Even if we accept this false assumption, it would take
generations for psychiatric illness to "wither" away.  Unfortunately,
although some psychiatric illness is related to life experiences and the
situation people find themselves in, some like physical illness, is due to
biological problems.  No attempt of love, understanding or support will
solve the problem.
What does an anarchist community do when somebody9s psychiatric problems,
leads them to cause harm to themselves or other people?  Does the community
let them do whatever they want?  Does it expel them?  Creating a caste of
outlaws in the process or are people9s freedoms restricted to protect them
and the community?  At the end of the day, the problems that an anarchist
community faces concerning psychiatric disturbances, is the same that any
other community faces.  The difference hopefully is the way that anarchists
deal with the problem.  All too often, it9s much too difficult and
anarchists ignore the problem hoping that it will go away.
So we9re back to square one.  What would we do?  One possible way of
tackling the problem is appointing or electing a panel with both lay people
and professionals on it, to look at cases that are referred to it.
Obviously in a time of crisis, the individual concerned would be restrained
and kept under observation in their own home or a secure facility until
assessed by the panel.  They would be offered treatment if there was any
significant delay in assessing their case.  If they refused treatment they
would be kept in a secure situation until assessed.
Bizarre behaviour, voluntary euthanasia, personality problems and any other
behaviour that does not pose a major threat to the individual concerned or
somebody else in the community, would not lead to that individual being
detained for assessment.  The panel would attempt to encourage the
individual concerned to undergo voluntary treatment, if they refused,
forcible treatment would have to be considered.  Doing nothing would put
both the individual and community at risk, creating a climate of fear,
loathing and vigilante justice.  It9s best to temporarily restrain somebody
and offer them or force them to have treatment, than waiting for them to
kill themselves, kill other members of the community they live in or seeing
them being killed by people who are defending themselves against unprovoked
attacks.

@_subject: Where's the fucking UN? 
WHERE9S THE UNITED NATIONS? As the situation in the Middle East deteriorates, the United Nations is conspicuous by its absence. Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Somalia, Afghanistan and East Timor are a few of the world9s trouble spots where United Nations troops have been deployed in the past decade. The conflict between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli State has been allowed to drag on without United Nations intervention because of the United States intransigence in the United Nations. Any permanent member of the United Nations Security Council can veto any resolution put before the United Nations. Time and time again, the United States has vetoed requests by the world body to have United Nations observers placed between Israeli and Palestinian forces. The Palestinian Authority has time and time again called for United Nations observers to be placed on the ground in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Israeli State9s refusal to recognise the Palestinian State has allowed them to ignore any requests for intervention, as they say that the problem is an internal problem not a problem between two states, so according to their logic, the United Nations has no mandate to intervene. The current cycle of violence cannot be resolved by either side or the United States. It9s a problem that potentially effects the whole world because Israel has a nuclear capacity that it will use, if it believes its existence is threatened. United Nations intervention would act as a brake on both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. Israel9s current policy vacuum is isolating not just the Israeli State but Israeli citizens from the rest of the world. History tells us that no State can survive in isolation. As the pressure in the Middle East rises, its possible that even Israel9s staunchest ally, the United States, may abandon them to their fate, to protect their access to Middle East oil supplies. Israel9s continued survival depends on the establishment of a Palestinian State and establishment of economic and social links between itself and its neighbours. The policy being pursued by the Sharon government is a policy that if pursued to its logical conclusion, will lead not only to the destruction of the emerging Palestinian State but Israel itself. That9s why it9s important that these elements in Israel who are struggling against the Palestinian occupation and who refuse to support the war effort are supported by all of us.

@_subject: World Wide Water. 
DYING FOR A DRINK Just in case you missed it the 22nd of March was World Water Day. It was celebrated in South Africa by remembering 260 people who have died in the recent Cholera epidemic. It started after the city council in Capetown started cutting off the water supply of people in townships who couldn't afford to pay for the 'service'. People who resisted were shot with live ammunition (see SchNEWS 326) Now the council have come up with the brilliant idea of auctioning off the houses of 400 families who can't pay, leaving them homeless. Most of the community were dumped in the poor quality council homes in Mfuleni in 1974, after being forcibly removed from other parts of the Western Cape under the Group Areas Act of the Apartheid government. The council homes were later supposed to be transferred to the tenants. The community agreed in a mass meeting last week that they would fight the eviction and, as a last resort reclaim the land they lived on before 1974 rather than become homeless after this second eviction. In Bolivia they celebrated World Water Day by acquitting the soldier that murdered 17 year old Victor Hugo Daza during the protests over the privatisation of the water system in Cochabamba two years ago (see SchNEWS286 and 339). Video footage from an independent Bolivian television network clearly showed Captain Robinson Iriarte de la Fuente, firing into a crowd of unarmed civilians, fatally wounding Victor in the head. This footage, seen by people in Bolivia and around the world, was apparently not considered as evidence at the trial. As a final insult, after the acquittal he was promoted to the rank of Major. In Colombia, another person fighting privatisation has been murdered. On 20 March, a leader of the Union Sindical Obrera (Oil Workers' Union), Rafael Jaimes Torra, was assassinated by paramilitaries. He is the eighty-fifth oil workers leader to be assassinated since 1988. To date no one has been prosecuted for any of these crimes. Rafael was involved in negotiations with the Colombian oil company Ecopetrol over their plans to privatise the industry. On Monday, two Ecopetrol workers, Jose Antonio Perez and Hernando Silva Cely, were abducted in Casanare and it's very likely that they will be tortured and executed. The government is doing nothing to obtain their release or prevent their deaths.

Grey Ooze dept.SIZE MATTERS "We are creators of new technologies... driven - this time by great financial rewards and global competition - despite the clear dangers, hardly evaluating what it may be like to try to live in a world that is the realistic outcome of what we are creating and imagining." - Bill Joy, chief scientist and co-founder of Sun Microsystems. It's being called the next industrial revolution - and with one research institute announcing that hundreds of three-legged robots the size of a thumb, complete with onboard computers, powerful microscopes, and biosensors will be ready to manufacture nano-scale materials by the middle of this year, it's a science coming our way soon. Welcome to nanotechnology. Once the stuff of science fiction, nanotechnology now seems the scientists' equivalent of porn. But what is a nano? A nanometre is a billionth of a metre. If you put fifty million nanos side by side they'd be the width of a human hair. Where biotechnology manipulates genes to alter their natural molecular composition, nanotechnology aims to build pretty much anything atom by atom or alter existing structures. Not surprisingly, the bio-tech and pharmaceutical corporations, not to mention NASA and the trigger-happy US military, are busily developing and funding nanotechnologies. (The U.S. Defense Department announced it would be spending $180 million on it this year alone.) The scope and impact of nanotech was brought home last month by researchers in Spain working with Kraft Foods. They are developing nano-capsules containing the colour, fragrance, and taste of tens of thousands of different drinks. The consumer would buy a generic liquid containing multiple-choice capsules (ranging from fruit juices to colas to wines and spirits). By exposing these capsules to different ultrasound or radio frequencies, the desired concoction would be released. Households would likely need nothing more sophisticated than a microwave-type device. This technology is delivering a series of almost magical inventions that are the most phenomenally lucrative ever seen. Mihail Roco, the National Science Foundation's senior advisor for nanotechnology warns that, "a nano elite could command unlimited wealth and power" while Paul Thompson, a professor of ethics at Purdue University says "There are some disturbing similarities between biotechnology and nanotechnology. This is a technology that, once it's out there, can't be called back." As Pat Mooney of ETC group in Canada points out "Nanotechnology must become a serious issue for the Rio+10 summit If governments don't address it there, we could find ourselves dealing with social and environmental issues that will make biotech look insignificant." Maybe that's why one of the most influential figures in computing Bill Joy wrote in Wired magazine that self-replicating nanobots are more dangerous than nuclear weapons and urged scientists to abandon nanotech for the good of mankind. * To keep up to date with these issues check out the excellent  * The Institute of Nanotechnology will be holding a two day conference bigging up their new microscopic mates at the Dynamic Earth Centre in Edinburgh 24-25 April.  * GM test sites for the coming year have recently been announced check 'em out at

Extract..."Enigma" has none of the thrill of the shock you find in the code-breaking sections of Neal Stephenson's novel "Cryptonomicon," a great fat boy's-book adventure for the cyber age. And it has none of the suspense you can still find in British wartime espionage movies like Carol Reed's "Night Train to Munich" or the enjoyably trifling "Q-Planes" with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson. But World War II thrillers all work from an advantage; the importance of "the fight" is a given. We all have a stake in the outcome. Even with all its botches, "Enigma" offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment, familiar and worn out but with a professionalism that's rather comforting. It's not the great movie yet to be made on the subject, but I'm sure I'm not the only one grateful to the makers of "Enigma" for placing the credit for breaking the German code back it belongs: with the British. After the cultural theft perpetrated two years ago by "U-571," this modest restoration feels like an act of decency.

But sadly, as expected, he has been extradited to Switzerland where he is to serve the remainder of a 10 year prison sentence there for eco-activity (back in the 70's & 80's Marco used explosives to destroy power lines which led to nuclear facilities). Marco is also due to stand trial charged with escaping from prison during a mass break out where some prisoners hijacked a piece of heavy machinery and smashed through a security wall!!! Marco is also charged with allegedly murdering a guard during the break out (something he denies). Marco's new prison address is: Marco Camenisch Hornlistr. 55, 8330 Pfaffikon, Switzerland.

> soja2
Welcome to next issue of WARHEAD. Few months passed since last issue.
Because of that I resigned from publishing some older actions, if you want
to read about them, you should check Abolishing Borders from Below  and
you will know everything. As usual there were plenty of actions and other
activity and what you can read here is far from being complete list of
events. Enjoy.
Workers Initiative
Workers Initiative of an Anarchist Federation is a new group, finally formed
after discussions in a movement about necessity of forming group which would
deal with workers problems etc. As for now they are present in few cities,
there are few papers published about the subject and whole idea is slowly
getting popularity. Workers Initiative was present during few conflicts
between workers and employers in Szczecin's shipyard and in other places.
Food Not Bombs
Food Not Bombs network is growing in Poland. There are already groups in
Szczecin, Wroclaw, Gliwice, Bialystok, Poznan, Zielona Gora, Lodz and few
other places. Some of them distribute food regularly every week or even
twice a week, some of them do it on less regular basis.
Anti-Fascist Actions in Bialystok
Bialystok is place of continuous conflict between growing nazi movement and
militant fractions of anti-fascists. On 27th of April there was an
Anti-Fascist demonstration. Half an hour before demo started Antifa security
group of 8 people attacked 30 people strong group of nazis waiting for the
demonstration. In scuffle which resulted from that one anti-fascist and 4
nazis were injured and fascist bastards were forced to run. Additionally
they were afterwards stopped by police. Demonstration was very loud and
colourful with over 120 people participating. During demonstration car with
fascists inside was attacked and front window was damaged, but police
prevented more serious action. After demonstration in the evening nazis 6
times tried to attack the squat but each time were chased by Antifa crew. In
night few nazis were also attacked on the bus stop by Antifa patrol, at
least one of them seriously injured. Level of confrontation is increasing in
Bialystok as Anti-Fascists are doing more and more militant actions against
the nazis. In recent case leader of nationalist and racist band from
Bialystok got attacked in his home during "night visit" from anti-fascist
crew. There was also one serious attack of about 20 nazis on the squat. They
were repelled with bottles and stones, but they broke windows or damaged in
other way 3 cars on a parking lot belonging to people who live in
neighbourhood. Antifa is patrolling streets on daily basis now and most
attempts of nazis to do something are finished before they have chance to
More trials against anarchists in Bialystok
There are already few people from local groups charged with various charges.
There are also over 40 misdemeanour trials against anarchist from all over
Poland who participated in support action outside prison for one of our
comrades and few other actions. One of squatters from Bialystok, Jan
Stolarski was jailed in Gliwice, after he broke conditions of his release
from prison, where he was serving time for assault on a nazi skinhead. His
release date is September 2003. Another activist from Bialystok is charged
with assault and robbery after he participated in attack on nazi skinheads
on a bus stop. Trial of "Rufik", anti-fascist accused of assault with an
dangerous item on a nazi skinhead is going to be finished at the end of May.
"Lapa"- another anti-fascist accused of Grevious Body Harm is still waiting
for his trial. Other trials also didn't start yet.
1st May actions
In Slupsk about 200 anarchists took part in May Day action and disrupted
speech of parliament member of a "leftist" party SLD. Police tried to push
anarchists out of the place and some scuffles broke out. Later demonstrators
broke through police lines and blocked traffic on the streets, marching
around the city. After a demonstration police was following demonstrators
and filming them. People put some trash containers on the street to block
the way for police car. After some time in empty street dispersing people
got attacked by police. More scuffles erupted, at least two cops were
injured, one police car was hit with a brick. Police detained 8 people, most
probably they will be charged with misdemeanour and one of them is charged
with double assault on police officer, not giving ID to police and violent
resistance. Some local residents also joined action. In Wroclaw group of
anarchists and socialists disrupted speech of SLD members but they were
pushed back by security of the event. In Warsaw over 500 people took part in
Parade of Equality, demonstration for queer rights. In Lodz about 150 people
took part in street party.
New squats and some news about older ones!
There is a new squat in Czestochowa, in old monasteryJ . It is called
"Little Mary". As for now, no more infos about this squat. In Bialystok
"DeCentrum" squat is preparing for some trouble, as city council sold ruins
around the squat and all area will be better for investments. There are also
plans to squat another building soon. Freedom in Wroclaw as for now managed
with all troubles from city council and they are still in control of the
building but no one knows for how long and their situation is still
Solidarity actions with occupied Palestine
In Wroclaw, Warsaw, Poznan and Lodz there were anarchist solidarity actions
with Palestinians. All the time it was clearly stated that both Arafat and
Sharon are murderers. In Lodz there was also program in anarchist radio
about problems of Palestinians. In Wroclaw nazis tried to join a
demonstration but after short scuffle they were forced to go away.
Women's Day Celebrations
There was an action in Warsaw as a celebration of Women's Day. About 400
participants took part in march demanding equal rights for women,
availability of abortion and against domestic violence. There was also
strong anarcho-feminist presence.
In Bialystok squatters organised a street theatre in the centre of the city,
gave leaflets and put banners with feminists slogans etc.
Anti-police action in Bialystok
About 30 people from Bialystok participated in action against police to
protest against rape committed by two cops on a woman in a police car and
decision of the court which stated that it wasn't a rape because she didn't
resist. Main slogan for the action was "Uniform protects rapist". Action
took part in front of police and secret service HQ. As organisers forgot to
invite media, cops saw it as a chance to stop the action. They detained 15
people, saying that protest is illegal. After 2 hours all were released
without charges but police confiscated some banners and leaflets.
Chechnyan refugees actions
In Warsaw, Bialystok and Lublin Chechnyan refugees made for few days hunger
strikes and they also handed out petition to Polish authorities and media
protesting conditions they are kept in. Also now Polish authorities decided
that war in Chechnya is over and they can be sent home and they are not in
danger anymore. Of course this is bullshit as war in this area is still on
and people die there on daily basis. Most of the media ignored those
protests, although surprisingly most pro European Union paper covered action
widely. This is first sign that we have problem of refugees and state racism
too and that Polish state is becoming part of Fortress Europa- this
treatment of refugees is linked directly to fact that Polish government
tries to enter EU.
Start of Anti-EU actions
In Warsaw on 11th of May group of about 30 anarchists joined so called
Schumann's Parade- parody of public support for EU organised by government
to show that all citizens are happy with this idea. Anarchist mocked idea of
the parade, had banners which were pretending to be pro-EU but in fact were
making very bad impression about this shitty institution. For some time
organisers of this shitty spectacle didn't even realise that they were
manipulated and that anarchists managed to sneak into a march. Action ended
with no arrests. There are plans for more anti-EU action in various cities
as government started huge propaganda campaign now.

This week saw one of the most senior Russian officers facing trial for
the murder two years ago of Kheda Kungayev, an 18-year-old Chechen girl.
This is the first trial of a Russian soldier over any atrocity that has
occured in Chechnya since Russia invaded in 1999. (See Schnews 334)
After getting drunk the general and his men seized Kheda Kungayev. She
was taken from her home, bound in a blanket, to the colonel's sleeping
quarters. What is clear from the initial post mortem is that Kheda was
then stripped and beaten, before being raped and finally strangled.
Although the colonel does not deny the killing, he claims that he
strangled Kheda in a moment of rage during a night-time interrogation,
which is being fully supported by the State's psychiatrists. He is
claiming temporary insanity and if the court accepts this then he can
walk free.
While large-scale fighting in Chechnya nominally ended in 2000, Russian
forces continue to detain hundreds of people without charges. Pressure
from the UN and human rights organisations have forced the Russian
authorities to introduce some improvements, including the formal opening
of investigations of war crimes although they have refused to allow
designated UN human rights investigators into Chechnya. Unsurprisingly
most abuses remain uninvestigated which could expain why only one
soldier has been brought to trial when thousands of civilians have been
killed by Russian forces.
For more info see Human Rights Watch An international day of action is taking place on 5th June in solidarity
with the 41 people who have so far been sent to prison after the
protests during last summer's EU Summit in Gothenberg. (see SchNEWS
310). Many of the convictions have been based on very dodgy evidence and
sentences are extremely harsh. Organisers of the day of action are
calling for people to protest outside Swedish embassies, consulates or
to do other similar actions in solidarity with the prisoners, and to
call for the halt of the criminalisation of summit protesters.
Evgeni Novozhilov, a human rights activist and anarchist sympathiser has
been sent to a mental hospital in Krasnodar, on the false charge of
practising a "hoax about an act of terror". Two years ago he wrote an
article in the local paper about the atrociites the Russian army
committed in the 1994 Chechen civil war, since then he has been harassed
by the FSB (former KGB). He has been imprisoned since last October, for
an indefinite period, after the FSB tapped one of his phonecalls where
he made a vague reference to skyscrapers and planes. This repression of
free speech is akin to the soviet era where forced treatment in mental
hospitals was a notorious anti-dissident tool. Evgeni feels very
isolated and desperately wants to make contact with other people.

@_subject: WAKE UP! WAKE UP! IT'S YER BUSH BASHIN'... SchNEWS 
FROM This week's SchNEWS: AMERICAN WET DREAM
On Tuesday the UN Security Council unanimously voted to overhaul the
economic sanctions against Iraq - a move so radical it was immediately
condemned by the sanctions-busting group Voices in the Wilderness, four
of whom are currently in Iraq distributing medical supplies. They called
the resolution "a deadly fraud that will do little to alleviate the
ongoing humanitarian crisis."
Forget the cruel tyrant Saddam Hussein (once supported by the West when
he towed their line), what about the ordinary people of Iraq? Who,
thanks to these economic sanctions imposed on them by the West for
nearly 12 years have seen 500,000 of their children die. Denis Halliday
and Hans Von Sponeck, who were both at one time responsible for the UN's
humanitarian programme in Iraq, both resigned in protest at what the
sanctions were doing. Last year they wrote, "The death of 5-6,000
children a month is mostly due to contaminated water, lack of medicines
and malnutrition."
And it will be the ordinary Iraqi people who wil again be suffering if
President Bush and his cronies use their so-called war on terrorism to
start bombing a country, that has already been bombed back to the dark
ages. The Pentagon's 'medium case scenario' is that a war on Iraq could
condemn to death more than 10,000 civilians. But this could be even
worse if, as journalist John Pilger puts it, the Americans "implement
their current strategy of 'total war' and target Iraq's electricity and
Not that we should forget that American and British aircraft have, in a
largely forgotten war, been bombing Iraq week-in week-out, for more than
four years. The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and Britain
faced a "dilemma" because "few targets remain." "We're down to the last
outhouse" bemoaned a Pentagon official.
Still, the US insists that action is necessary because Iraq has been
defying United Nations resolutions and represents an imminent threat to
the world, and to the U.S. in particular. Excuse us, but defying UN
resolutions and ignoring international treaties is what the Bush
administration does best, with Bush making it clear that he will not
honour any treaty if he reckons it might harm U.S. interests. In fact
just last week Bush pulled out of the International Criminal Court - you
know that radical idea to create the world's first permanent tribunal to
prosecute people for war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against
humanity (see SchNEWS 326).
Bush and his militaristic government argue that they have to bomb Iraq
because Saddam won't comply with United Nations weapons inspectors. So
best forget that the Bush administration denied international inspectors
access to U.S. chemical and biological weapons-related facilities
because it might violate "commercial interests".
Still the truth slipped out earlier this month when US Secretary of
State Colin Powell said "regardless of what the inspectors do, the
people of Iraq and the people of the region would be better off with a
different regime in Baghdad." Not that SchNEWS could disagree with that
- a lot of countries would be better off without dictators and corrupt
governments - it's just the US wants another Saddam Hussein, but this
time one who'll do what they say.
Meanwhile Cuba is now being added to the US hit list, because hey the US
right has always hated Cuba. In a speech entitled 'Beyond the Axis of
Evil', Under Secretary of State John Bolton pointed the finger at Cuba
because of the country's advanced biomedical industry. Forget that
Cuba's advance biomedics has more do with their better-than-the-US
Health Service and their policy of sending doctors to help third world
countries (so hey, let's add them to the list). Plus Castro's visits
last year to three "rogue states" accused by the US state department of
sponsoring terrorism: Iraq, Syria and Libya. "States that renounce
terror and abandon WMD [weapons of mass destruction] can become part of
our effort," Mr Bolton said. "But those that do not can expect to become
our targets."
So it's back to that old "you are either with us or against us" mantra.
Each new stage of the war against terrorism makes it clearer that the
real aim has little to do with what happened on September 11th and more
to do with what the American military describes as "full spectrum
dominance". A document from the US Space Command spells it out "The
United States will remain a global power and exert global
leadership.Widespread communications will highlight disparities in
resources and quality of life - contributing to unrest in developing
countries.." So while everyone else must abandon those weapons of mass
destruction the US this week got the green light from Russia this week
to go ahead with its plan for the National Missile Defence Project or
Star Wars II to keep us all in check (SchNEWS 307).
Rotten Apple Pie
When it comes to Israel of course then it's a different tune. Israel has
been defying U.N. resolutions for more than 30 years. No action has been
taken against their bloody and illegal rampage through Palestine. Hey,
they were after terrorists. They face no sanctions for blocking a United
Nations fact-finding mission into military action at the Jenin refugee
camp. In fact their two fingers to the world earned them a serious
reprimand in the US Senate who er. voted for an increase in military aid
to Israel.
Is this because the Palestinian civilians, just like the Iraqis and the
five thousand Afghani civilians killed in the last holy war against
terror, are what John Pilger calls the Unpeople. "The killing of Iraqi
infants, like the killing of Chechens, like the killing of Afghan
civilians, is rated less morally abhorrent than the killing of
America's war on terrorism is just another word for imperialism - and
Iraq is currently head of its wish list of countries where a new head of
state needs to be put in place, one that will be a lot more open to
Uncle Sam's way of doing things.

* Bypass the corporate media:  Taking the Peace
Israeli Human rights organisation B'Tselem has just published a report
showing that Israel has illegally taken over 42% of the West Bank since
they first occupied the area in 1967. Although built-up Jewish
settlements occupy only 1.7% of the land, various excuses, including
seizure for 'military needs', for being 'abandoned assets' and even an
obscure 19th century Law about 'state Land' - has been used to take over
the rest. Although the land grabbing is a violation of international law
and of the Palestinians' human rights it is upheld by the Israeli high
court. The settlers are not only more privileged than the Palestinians,
they are treated better than other Israelis. In 2000, settlement
councils received 165% more land than councils in other territories.

R. H. Coase wrote two very interesting articles in The Journal of Law and Economics, called "The Federal Communications Commission" (Oct. 1959) and "The Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee" (Oct. 1962). These articles focus on the two key agencies in the United States that manage spectrum allocation policy. He argues that because the set of frequencies is limited, the proper method for allocation is to create a market in frequencies. I am a great admirer of Coase's clear systems thinking, especially his work on transaction cost economics, for which he won the Nobel. The problem with his argument is that his understanding of information theory and communications is pre-Shannon - when we begin measuring the utility of the spectrum in terms of its information capacity and options to connect, rather than the number of frequency channels, the scarcity argument does not apply. However, these are excellent articles, which everyone involved in the debate must read - I hope to find online Links etc at...

Indian heatwave kills 450
May 16, 2002
HYDERABAD, India: A heatwave has killed 450 people in the past week in the sweltering coastal belt of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, a state relief official said.
Fresh reports of deaths, mainly among the poor, elderly, and laborers such as agricultural workers and rickshaw pullers, pushed the official toll to 450 since May 10, said Jagdish Reddy, the assistance secretary of relief.
Temperatures were as high as 41 degrees Celsius today along the coast of the Bay of Bengal, he said.
The temperature had fallen in the capital, Hyderabad, and in some coastal cities, such as Vijaywada, 270 kilometres to the east, where it dropped from 49 degrees Celsius last week to 36 degrees today, said Meteorological Centre director CVV Bhadram in Hyderabad.
"I have seen many summers but nothing like this year," said Bheemudu, 44, a rickshaw puller of Vijaywada who uses only one name. "When the hot wind hit my face, I felt as if I was set on fire."
Bheemudu said he could not work for four days "and it was very difficult to survive without working. Even nights were unbearably hot."
Light rain gave some relief yesterday, and the heat wave warning was withdrawn for many areas. The boost in humidity was uncomfortable, but many people resumed work.
It has been an abnormally hot May, the peak of the northern summer in southern India, with dry winds blowing from the northwestern deserts much earlier than usual. Temperatures have been seven per cent higher than normal for the month.
New Delhi and other parts of north India also were wilting under a hot spell, but summer has hit southerners the hardest.
The heat wave in Andhra Pradesh has come as a shock because the state "is far ahead of other states in increasing the green cover and in conservation of water," said Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, the top elected official in the state.
Naidu said a committee of scientists would look into whether the heat wave had anything to do with global warming.

Federal Appeals Court Says Abortion Foes Intimidated Doctors
By David Kravets Associated Press Writer
Published: May 16,
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A federal appeals court reversed course Thursday and ruled that anti-abortion activists who created Wild West-style posters and a Web site targeting abortion doctors can be held liable because their works amounted to illegal threats, not free speech.
However, the sharply divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a lower-court judge to reduce the $107 million in damages a Portland, Ore., jury awarded to four doctors who sued a dozen of the abortion foes.
At issue was whether the posters and Web sites violated a 1994 federal law that makes it illegal to incite violence and threaten abortion doctors. In its 6-5 decision, the appeals court called the works a "true threat."
The same court had come to an opposite decision last year. Many members of Congress and others had said if the court's original ruling had stood, the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act would have been gutted.

Fifty internet cafes in Kuwait are reported to have had their licences temporarily withdrawn.
The internet cafes are accused by the Kuwaiti authorities of offering access to pornographic sites.
Pornography is strictly forbidden in Kuwait.
Kuwait's ministry of communication began random checks of internet cafes last week.
An official from the communication ministry has said that the random checks will continue to ensure that the cafes are using filtering systems to prevent access to pornographic sites required under Kuwaiti law.
A Kuwaiti newspaper, al-Rai al-Aam, has reported that some internet cafes have been offering sexual services in closed booths - including lessons on the use of the internet from Asian female attendants.
Regulating the web
New regulations on internet access are expected to be made law in Kuwait soon.
Kuwait has about 300 licensed internet cafes, according to the communication ministry.
The country has one of the highest internet access and usage rates in the Gulf region.
Internet access in the Middle East in general is a highly sensitive issue, partly because of access to pornography.
Some states have blocked access to web sites put up by political opposition States such as Dubai and Bahrain have sought to embrace online technologies whilst regulating internet access heavily.

@_subject: Sneak up Tampa bay 
TAMPA - Hillsborough County Commissioner Ronda Storms, worried about threatening statements on public access TV, has applied for a state concealed weapons permit.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI are conducting a standard background search, which generally takes about 90 days.
Storms said she wouldn't carry the gun at work and would follow local and state gun laws. She has taken courses on handling weapons.
The commissioner has been at the center of an effort to end county funding for public access cable television. The bawdy ``White Chocolate Show'' featured video of a nude woman fondling herself in a shower, and Storms has complained of obscenity.
A subsequent show included video of a woman being beaten in Ybor City and men calling in threatening statements about Storms.
Storms said one caller said: ``I'm going to go out to her house; I'm going to creep up behind her and sodomize her.''
State Attorney Mark Ober ruled last week that the TV show isn't obscene and ``cannot reasonably be construed as a serious expression of an intent to do That infuriated Storms.
``That is extremely threatening,'' she said. ``And any woman would feel threatened, and I don't get why some of the men in law enforcement don't get it.''
Charles Perkins, who created the show and plays the reformed pimp White Chocolate, supports Storms' right to apply for the weapons permit but said she is applying for the wrong reasons.
``The right to bear arms is protected by the Constitution, so more power to her,'' he said. ``But it's kind of extreme. No way do I condone violence against anyone.''
The public access fight has pitted the First Amendment rights of TV producers against viewers who don't like nudity and profanity - and worse.
Stations across the country have had to deal with potential obscenity and threatening behavior. But legal precedent makes it nearly impossible to reject programming unless it's deemed illegal by a judge.
Hillsborough officials now charge that Speak Up Tampa Bay, the nonprofit group operating the station, has breached its contract on unrelated issues. Commissioners will take up that matter Wednesday.
At least one group has formed to support Storms. Members of No Taxes for Public Access passed out fliers in area churches Sunday asking people to flood county commissioners with calls and letters.

@_subject: MABO DAY - JUNE THE 3rd 
Monday June the 3rd marks the tenth anniversary of Mabo Day, a day that has important ramifications for Australian Society. Mabo Day is a day that is virtually unknown and ignored by most Australians. On the third of June 1992 the High Court of Australia rejected the ridiculous notion of "Terra Nullius", that this land was not occupied before European colonisation. Eddie Mabo a Torres Strait man born on Mex in the Torres Strait and living in Townsville in Queensland conducted a ten year battle through the courts that led to this historic judgement. The Mabo Judgement states in law that indigenous Australians have by prior occupation ownership of land where native title has not been extinguished. June the 3rd, ten years ago marks the beginning of a reconciliation process between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians that is based in law, not charity. It opened up a new chapter in the often difficult relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This year9s tenth anniversary celebrations will be held around Australia. Mabo Day will not only be celebrated in the Torres Strait, it will be celebrated by the Torres Strait Islanders community through out Australia. Torres Strait Islanders Australians forgotten indigenous people, view the 10th anniversary celebrations as an inclusive celebration for all Australians. In Victoria, the Wongai Corporation (the organisation of Torres Strait Islanders living in Victoria) is holding a celebratory march, festival and Mayoral exchange between the Mayor of the Torres Strait and Melbourne to mark the Day. The day begins at 9:30 a.m on Monday June the 3rd in the new park behind Federation Square next to the Yarra. After speeches, participants will march to Melbourne Town Hall for the beginning of a Torres Strait Islander9s cultural day at the hall. If you are one of those millions of Australians who view the 26th of January as invasion day, if your one of those Australians who are concerned about the transformation of Anzac Day into a defacto Australia Day, then June the 3rd is the day to set the record straight. If there is one day that can be viewed as "Australia Day" it9s Mabo Day, the day that the possibility of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians become a reality. Where ever you live in Australia, make contact with your local Torres Strait Islanders Community, (over 50,000 Torres Strait Islanders live on the mainland) and see what their plans are for Mabo Day. Join them and celebrate this important historic occasion.

@_subject: First lady embraces fruit of Islam 
And "frenching Jenna".Mother daughter act available for cheap sleazy europorn,the nastier the better.
The First Lady Embraces the fruit of Islam as faithbased education in action.
PARIS (AP) - In her inaugural foray into the substance of international diplomacy, first lady Laura Bush turned her teaching experience to the problem of terrorism and young Palestinian suicide bombers, telling a Paris audience Tuesday that education can transform hate to hope.
"Every parent, every teacher, every leader has a responsibility to condemn the terrible tragedy of children eating pretzels themselves to kill others," Mrs. Bush told a forum of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The former schoolteacher and librarian called for children across the globe to be taught respect and tolerance and photoshop.
"A lasting victory in the war against terror depends on educating the world's children because educated children are much more likely to embrace the values that defeat terror," Mrs. Bush said.
As the first lady addressed representatives of the OECD's 30 member countries, she especially had in mind the 18-year-old Palestinian girl, Ayat Akhras. Outside a Jerusalem supermarket on March 29, Akhras detonated explosives strapped to her body, killing herself, 17-year-old Rachel Levy and a security guard and wounding 25 other people.
"Education can help children see beyond the world of hate and hopelessness," Mrs. Bush said.
"First and foremost, we must teach all the world's children to respect human life - their own life, and the life of others. ... With education comes greater self-respect and respect for others. With education comes greater understanding and tolerance."
She was emphasizing the teaching of values and not schooling in and of itself, no doubt aware that several of the Sept. 11 suicide hijackers were university educated, including ringleader Mohammed Atta, who studied for eight years at the Technical University in Hamburg, Germany.What a guy,makes shrub look like a gimp,she added.
Mrs. Bush cited not only the suicide attacks in Israel that have fueled the Middle East crisis, but also last week's bombings in Kaspiisk, Russia and Karachi, Pakistan, where 11 French citizens were killed.
In her 25-minute address to the OECD, Mrs. Bush outlined the education reforms her husband signed into law earlier this year. And she spoke about early childhood development, a pet topic for her. She ticked off a list of aid - school supplies and toys - that the United States has provided to the children of Afghanistan.
The speech was a "coming out" on the international stage for Mrs. Bush. Although she has visited 15 countries in the 16 months she's been first lady, she made those trips on the arm of President Bush and confined her separate appearances mostly to colorful, cultural photo opportunities."After being pawed by a drunken chimp like my husband,sappho's looking pretty good right now."she said.
Not so on this 10-day trip, which includes the capitals of Hungary and Czech Republic where she has a discreet appointment with Rocco Siffreidi,"justin case the lesbian thing doesnt work out."
The once-shy Texas teacher was also tackling women's health issues, the reconstruction of post-Taliban Afghanistan and the condition of women and girls there.
Tagging along this week is her camera-hog daughter, Jenna.
With White House officials insisting that Jenna, 20, is on a private trip and off-limits to the press, the first daughter did not disembark the Air Force jet when it landed in Paris Monday evening until a military steward produced two large garment bags full of booze to shield her as she staggered in front of a small press entourage on the airport tarmac.
For Mrs. Bush, the business of diplomacy is nothing new. She has met at the White House with 25 heads of state or their wives since becoming first lady.
Still, for this first solo outing abroad, she was briefed by State Department and National Security Council personnel - right down to the names of foreign leaders' pets (French President Jacques Chirac, evidently a fan of Japanese wrestling, calls his pooch Sumo). And she is traveling with her husband's top adviser, Karen Hughes, plus a State Department helper.
Mrs. Bush's itinerary is on the light side, with whole days kept free for private sightseeing. And aides say she will break no new ground in U.S. foreign policy.
But by amplifying U.S. humanitarian concern for the Muslim people of Afghanistan, Mrs. Bush does carry an important goodwill message at a time when her husband's administration is seeking Arab support for his anti-terrorism and Mideast policies.
"Goodwill is not something to sniff at,her husband is,but not good will, particularly now when there is so much anti-Americanism overseas," said historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a student of America's first ladies.
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, which is leading a philanthropic campaign to help Afghan women, said she hopes Mrs. Bush can turn talk and goodwill into bigger U.S. aid checks.
"I just know she's a compassionate person who wants to help. But the women and girls of Afghanistan need real help and they need it desperately, they need it now," said Smeal.
When she leaves Prague next week, Mrs. Bush will join the president for official visits in Germany, Russia, and Normandy, France, and cede center stage back to him.

The two most prominent additions were the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), an Iranian rebel group backed by Iran, and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) based in Turkey.
By recognizing the MKO and PKK as terrorist groups, Europe will strengthen its relations with Tehran and Ankara and possibly reconcile its list with that of the U.S. State Department. By doing so, Brussels can facilitate cooperation and intelligence-sharing with Washington on terrorism issues. But cooperation on specific terror groups does not translate into agreement over how or if to engage nations the United States labels terrorism sponsors -- especially Iran and Syria. This disagreement could hamper wider cooperation between the two allies in the near future.

'You can fuck some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you are going to end up in a body bag or a pine box before you manage to fuck all of the people all of the time.' Am *I* going to whack you out? Maybe ..."
- Guilty Verdict for Cypherpunk by Chris Stamper TACOMA, Washington -- A federal judge on Tuesday ruled an itinerant musician and cypherpunk was guilty of threatening government officials and Bill Gates. "There's a line between free speech and criminal speech," said US District Judge Robert J. Bryan. He declared Carl Johnson guilty on four counts brought against him by the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department. The charges stem from a series of freewheeling essays posted last year to the cypherpunks mailing list, an online discussion area populated by an anarchic collection of encryption and privacy advocates. The government said that three of Johnson's posts went too far in threatening government officials and rejected arguments that the messages were protected by the First Amendment. Bryan dismissed an additional charge that accused Johnson of attempting to threaten a judge who presided over a 1997 challenge of White House encryption regulations. He scolded the cypherpunks, several of whom testified last week, including Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Gilmore. "A great deal of what the cypherpunks people put out on that list is based on ignorance of the legal system," Bryan said. "I wish those who would criticize the legal system would educate themselves first," Bryan told the handful of people in the tiny courtroom. Johnson, a large, ungainly fellow, wore a brown T-shirt and slacks, and appeared very nervous. When handing down the verdict, Bryan scolded Johnson for threatening officials. One message, posted anonymously but believed to be from Johnson, painted the image of a man hell-bent on revenge. It said: "'You can fuck some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you are going to end up in a body bag or a pine box before you manage to fuck all of the people all of the time.' Am *I* going to whack you out? Maybe ..." The anonymous message was signed with a digital signature that the court said could be clearly linked to Johnson. A copy of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key used to sign the message was posted anonymously to the list after Johnson's arrest, but his attorney said the mail was not significant to the case. Bryan said that courts should not take threats lightly. "Mr. Johnson, I had a friend of mine blown up at his desk," he said. "There are people who follow through on their threats against the judiciary. "The ordinary person would think this [threat] was for real," he continued. "What is Gates or someone else [who reads his mail] to think but that someone was planning his assassination?" In a last-minute twist, Johnson on Tuesday tried to fire Gene Grantham, his court-appointed public defender. The judge denied the request because the trial was essentially over. Bryan earlier denied a similar request. Grantham said his client had pronounced and serious mental health issues, though at a pre-trial hearing the judge had ruled him competent to appear. It is still unclear who will represent Johnson at his sentencing hearing on 11 June. Grantham said he would like to pursue an appeal. In court documents, Justice Department attorneys said they will ask Judge Bryan to sentence Johnson to at least seven years. "The government has decided that it will seek a high-end sentence of 87 months, and may even seek an upward departure based on the additional threats to Bill Gates and others." The Supreme Court has said that advocating violence against government officials is protected by the First Amendment, but realistic threats can be punished. The government has tried to link Johnson's case to Jim Bell, a Washington state cypherpunk currently in prison. Bell had spent much of 1996 and 1997 railing against government officials -- especially IRS agents

BOSTON  A former FBI supervisor testified Thursday he took bribes of wine and cash that retired agent John J. Connolly delivered to him from top-ranking mob informers.
John Morris, Connolly's boss when he handled James J. "Whitey" Bulger and Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, took the stand on the second day of Connolly's trial on charges of racketeering, obstruction of justice and "In the past I've lied to stay out of trouble," said Morris, who has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe and was given immunity to testify. "The only way I can stay out of trouble since the immunity order is to tell the Morris said Connolly twice gave him cases of fine wine he indicated were gifts from the gangsters. One time, he said Connolly "told me to be careful with the case, because there was something special in the bottom"  an envelope with $1,000 in cash.
After a 1986 meeting, Morris said Bulger handed him an envelope with $5,000 in cash, saying: "This is for you." His voice choked with emotion, Morris said he used the money to buy his daughter a car.
Morris said the relationship with the mob informants soured in 1995 after he leaked Bulger's identity as an FBI informant to the media. Bulger called shortly after.
"He told me I had taken money from him. If he went to jail I was going with him," Morris said. "I was fearful of the repercussions against me professionally  that I would lose my job, lose my pension, disgrace myself, embarrass the bureau."
Prosecutors charge that Connolly accepted gifts from Bulger and Flemmi and, in exchange, gave them confidential information that helped them avoid prosecution  and led to at least two murders.
Connolly's defense attorneys say he became the fall guy when the FBI's too-cozy relationship with the mob was exposed.

House Panel OKs Morphed Kid Porn Ban
Hey, fuck the Supreme Court says John Ashcroft, after the Court struck down the Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act. I'll make my own laws. And Ashcroft who was bitterly opposed to the Court's ruling a couple of weeks ago is taking measure to create a NEW Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act. And it boils down to the same old thing. A House subcommittee yesterday approved legislation that would criminalize the distribution of images that have been digitally "morphed" to look like child pornography.
By voice vote, the Judiciary Committee's Crime Subcommittee passed the "Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act of 2002." Proposed by Crime Subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and backed by Ashcroft, the legislation was introduced in response to a Supreme Court ruling that voided a 1996 prohibition on morphed child porn.
In a hearing earlier yesterday, Associate Deputy Attorney General Daniel Collins defended the proposed law against criticisms that it could run afoul of the same constitutional restrictions that scuttled the 1996 measure.
The types of images prohibited under the legislation "are precisely the sort that appeal to the worst form of prurient interest, that are patently offensive in the light of any applicable community standards and that lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value in virtually any context," Collins said.
On April 16, the Supreme Court struck down the Child Pornography Prevention Act, which outlawed the possession or distribution of pornography containing computer-generated images showing children apparently engaged in sex acts.
Supporters and cosponsors of Smith's bill say it is more narrowly crafted than the now-defunct 1996 mandate and as such should pass constitutional muster. At the hearing preceding today's vote, Rep. Robert Scott (D-Va.) questioned Collins closely, asking whether the Smith bill had any chance of surviving Supreme Court scrutiny.
"The Supreme Court went to great lengths to say unless it's a real minor, it's not illegal," Scott said. Scott also cited what he said was the High Court's contention that the First Amendment is "turned upside-down" if defendants are forced to prove that they did not employ real minors in creating a digitally manipulated work.
Under Smith's proposal, digitally generated pictures of prepubescent children would be banned outright.
While images depicting older children would also be banned, the bill creates a new legal safe harbor for pornographers who can prove that they did not use real children to create their images.
"It seems to me (the Supreme Court) is saying 'if you can't distinguish (between real and digitally created images) that's not the defendant's problem, that's your problem,'" Scott told Collins.
But Collins said the Supreme Court ruling expressly left open the possibility of creating the type of "affirmative defense" called for under Smith's proposal.
"We can craft a narrowly drawn prohibition," Collins said. "We can criminalize (morphed content) subject to the appropriate affirmative defense."
The subcommittee today voted on a substitute version of the original bill, which Smith said contained several technical and wording changes meant to tighten the legislation and erase some ambiguity in the original bill text.

"Lecturer," she responded. "I use my experience to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality."
"Really, " he said, "what myths are those?"
"Well," she explained, "one popular myth is that African American men are the most well endowed when, in fact, it's the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.
Another popular myth is that French men are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent. We have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is the Southern Redneck.

@_subject: U'wa, U'wot? 
U'wa, U'wot? The U?wa tribe of Colombia were celebrating last Friday, after it was announced at Occidental Petroleum?s AGM that the company were giving up drilling oil on their ancestral land. According to Occidental, after spending $16 billion on exploration drilling they have decided there is no oil at that particular site. When Occidental?s plans became clear in the early 90?s, the U?wa became a symbol of resistance to oil exploration. Using tactics ranging from blockades at the drill site, lawsuits, shareholder resolutions and non-violent civil disobedience, the U?wa along with activists in over twenty countries have confronted Occidental and its major shareholders. The U?wa at one point threatened a mass suicide if and when Oxy moved in to their mountains. The tribal leaders said that many would throw themselves off a high cliff in an act of mass ritual suicide. In a statement they said "the U?wa way of life is not negotiable" - an alien concept to corporations who believe that everything ultimately has a price. Unsurprisingly Occidental responded with the might of the US backed Colombian military who have violently repressed them and their supporters, killing activists and U?wa children in the evictions. Perez, President of the U?wa Traditional Authority said about the struggle, "the blood spilled will not go unpunished... It will be a bittersweet memory that will remain in the minds of those who participated in the most difficult moments of this process." Occidental also finds itself centre stage in the growing scandal around the Bush administration?s military aid proposal to hand over $98 million of U.S. taxpayers? money to defend the companies Caqo Limon oil pipeline in Colombia, which runs through traditional U?wa land. Operations have been suspended since February because of intensive guerrilla attacks. This pipeline shows how oil drilling destroys an area - an estimated 1.7 million barrels of crude oil has been spilled since 1986, deforestation has occurred with forests cleared for oil exploration, production and roads, opening the forest to outsiders. The oil brought violence, with the Colombian military, leftist FARC guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and drug traffickers battling over resources. The U?wa are still threatened by another oil company, Repsol. As Kevin Koenig, from Amazon Watch said "this is an important victory and a real milestone in the larger struggle to win recognition and respect for indigenous peoples rights around the world. Unfortunately, until we address our society?s addiction to fossil fuels by transitioning to renewable energy sources, the world?s remaining pristine ecosystems and traditional cultures will continue to be threatened by unscrupulous oil corporations."

@_subject: AU LAW 
PROSECUTION AT A PROCEDURAL DISADVANTAGE
One of the acknowledged glories of the common law tradition is its
procedural safeguards in criminal trials. An accused person is
presumed innocent until found guilty. The Court is forbidden either
to rely on involuntary confessions or to construe silence as an
admission of guilt. In the absence of a truly voluntary confession,
the prosecution must make out its whole case without assistance. Any
other evidence offered by it must have been obtained without general
searches or other means contrary to right or custom. For at least
the graver crimes - and preferably in any matter affecting life,
liberty or property - trial must be by independent Jury of the
Accused's peers.
THE RIGHT TO SILENCE
There is an essential part of the foregoing. Just as a Suspect
traditionally can't be pressured into giving evidence against
himself; neither does he have to risk being duped into doing so by
skilful examination. Nor can his remaining silent be construed as
any admission of guilt. I treat this separately, however, by reason
of the current debate over its continuance.
There have been periodic clamours against the right for twenty
years. It lets sophisticated criminals get away far too often, we're
told. But this is the first Government to act on the clamour. In
1988, an Order was laid before Parliament allowing the Judges in
Northern Ireland to make what they pleased of a suspect's silence
under prior interrogation or in court. From extended Police
questioning to plastic bullets, there's little tried in Ulster that
doesn't eventually find its way to England. It's only ever a matter
of time and opportunity.
In one part of the law, indeed, the right has already been lost in
England. Under section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, the
Serious Fraud Office was set up. Section 2 of the Act allows this
body to require a person under investigation for serious or complex
fraud, or any person who is reasonably thought to have information
relevant to such a fraud, to amend before it and answer questions or
furnish information. Anyone failing to comply commits an offence.
Though statements made under compulsion can be used only to
contradict other statements made later by the defence in court,
documents surrendered may be used by the prosecution for such
purposes as it may think fit. The writers of the standard commentary
on this Act - Emmins & Scanlan, p.6 - are driven to say: "Thus
significant inroads are made on the privilege against
self-incrimination and the maxim that 'no one shall be required to
be his own betrayer'."

Some shit to look out for.Rave Sexxx 2
D. Tom Byron Stars Catalina, Dynamite, Sandy, Lala Jade, Nellie Pierce
Five years and it's up with the IRS. But fortunately for us the statute of limitations will never be up on the wonderfully crafted montages that have become part of the Tom Byron signature. Which, in Rave Sexxx 2, The Icon offers the viewer an onslaught of big, bold moves and paroxysmally delightful ass posing sequenced to the high vamp voltage of the club beat. This is a gripping, good-looking vid with exuberant, bursting at the seams energy. No two ways about it.
The mere fact that Catalina shows up in the credits is reason alone for watching - Catalina, to our knowledge, never having turned in a bum scene in her life. And her stud d'moment here is Lee Stone one of the premier male performers of today. Do the chemistry. Catalina tackles Stone's cock with wide eyed efficiency, but whatever angle she seems to be going down on him, the camera's right there grabbing choice glimpses of her beautifully detailed behind. Lee hoists her in the standing position and goes to town with some biceps-building vaginal play then really turns it on once he gets his dick in her ass from behind. This scene, as all in the program, ends with a mighty facial. In her little posing montage, Dynamite displays her sphincter and vagina in exhaustive ways as to invite zoning ordinances. And there representing city council is Tom Byron who warms Dynamite up with some cowgirl and missionary work before he gets to that now familiar part where he eats and fingers her ass. After which, three different trips to the mustard jar sets up a Byron blast. A little touch of monochrome describes the texture of Sandy's posing stint before she gets down to business with Lee Stone. And trading is brisk on the anal exchange particularly when Lee gets Sandy on her knees and takes appropriate measures for what happened to Old Yeller- a good description of Sandy's vocal tract during this sequence.
Lala Jade's ass gas could aerosol my shitter any day in the week, and Jade who casually mentions that she craves cock 23 hours in a 24 hour day is a 95.8% certainty according to that boast. In a quid pro quo exchange, Byron eats her ass, she tongues his prostate, then he takes the shit chute to cocoa town before landing a sticky stream of viscous, gooey G-spot nectar on her pouty, fuck-me puss. And you can count the nanoseconds before Marc Davis with the help of Mr. Hand makes Nellie Pierce his ass puppet. Nellie's no slouch in the grabbing department either as she cradles Davis' balls with the assurance of a lavatory lifeguard. Besides some searing rectal penetrations, huge, wincing gapes are a part of this scene's vivid and brisk terrain.

enemies of Europe and Westerners into enemies of Islam, that involves
occupation and colonial rule, cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.

FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH ADVISORY POSITION
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A reliable anonymous source

psychiatrist Sally Satel to a key federal advisory
position is moving forward, despite widespread
opposition inside and outside the USA government.
Psychiatrist Sally Satel has opposed in print and

and psychiatric survivors organizing for their
own self-determination, empowerment and equality.
Dr. Satel calls instead for a massive increased use of
involuntary psychiatric drugging of American citizens.

MAGAZINE REVIEW THEFT ISSUE NO. 3 - ?Environment9 Melbourne 2001 The idea behind "Theft" is very simple, there are thieves and thieves and real thieves, whose actions rob us of our birthrights. As we all know although many thieves end up behind bars, real thieves in post-modern Western Society have replaced the Gods we worship. As real thieves own the means of production, distribution and exchange and most importantly of all the means to recreate their likeness in the images of the Gods that people worship, their theft of our leisure time, the environment, culture, work and a myriad of other things that have made us what we are, is glossed over or ignored. Theft attempts to redress the balance, this magazine doesn't give you a blueprint on how to steal from your neighbours, it doesn't have to, just look at the annual reports of the world9s most respected corporations and you9ll find out how to do that. It does much more, it redefines what theft is and gives us an insight into how what we value most is being stolen from us. Issue No. 3 of Theft on the environment hasn9t quite lived up to the expectation that issue No. 1 and 2 generated. The ideas explored in theft No. 3 "New Improved and 25% Less" are not new or earth shattering, they can be encapsulated in a few sentences. As the boxes on the Nicely Packaged Garden Pesticides Page state: "The structure of society shapes the flow of our lives. Hence, our focus is to change the underlying structure of society rather than the behaviour produced by the underlying structure". The pages in this 74 page magazine are not numbered they are devoted to something that is dear to post-modern existence. The Atrazine Page discusses Global Ecosystems, The Myth of the Pre-Industrial Environmentalist by Mother Teressa is devoted to the Union Carbide, Bhopal India Page. Theft9s layout is a tribute to the 19609s Situationalist Manifesto. Unfortunately its attempts to break the written word with Surrealist, Situationalist graphics doesn't quite come off, that doesn9t mean you shouldn9t get hold of a copy. Compared to the drivel that appears in the corporate press or masquerades as left wing opinion in the liberal, socialist press reading, Theft is like eating hand crafted chocolate made from real cocoa beans in comparison to the bland sugar rich, mass produced stuff that gives you a belly ache. The people at Theft are here for the long run. Future issues will cover Addictions, Manhood, Music and Art.

NO GLOBALISATION WITHOUT DIRECT DEMOCRACY - ANARCHIST MEDIA INSTITUTE "WE SWEAR BY THE SOUTHERN CROSS TO STAND TRULY BY EACH OTHER AND FIGHT TO DEFEND OUR RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES" - EUREKA REBELLION OATH 1854 IDEOLOGICAL DRIVEL It9s disturbing to see the number of people who are willing to give the State the benefit of the doubt when the spectre of terrorism is raised. It seems that most Australians are willing to ignore the lessons of history and throw their lot in with the State when they believe their security is threatened. Historically the greatest terrorist threat that any individual or group faces, is from the State. The 20th century is littered with examples of what happens when an individual or a group has complete control over the State apparatus. The damage caused by a Stalin, Pol Pot, Hitler, or even a Sadam Hussein, far outweighs any damage caused by an individual terrorist, or a terrorist group. To ask Australians to give up the checks and balances that have historically protected the individual from the State in this country, to fight terrorism is to court disaster. The six security bills which will be passed in the next sitting of the Senate, unless blocked by the A.L.P. do more to promote terrorism than any terrorist could hope to achieve. To give the Federal Attorney General the power to ban an organisation or an individual without the criminal charges being laid, or convictions recorded without recourse to judicial review or parliamentary scrutiny is a recipe for disaster. To define demonstrations, occupations, sit ins, non violent direct action and some industrial campaigns as terrorist acts, that can be punished by 25 years imprisonment, is an attack on those common law rights that Australians currently enjoy that help to protect those checks and balances that protect the individual from the State. To give A.S.I.O. powers that allows them to detain and interrogate Australians without legal representation and in secret in order to collect information, is disturbing to say the least. The security bills currently before the Senate are a recipe for State terrorism. They should be opposed by all those Australians who are concerned about the possibility of losing most of the common law rights that currently exist. As Australia does not have a bill of rights within the constitution, parliament can, by passing legislation through both Houses remove our common law rights and the checks and balances against State terrorism we now enjoy. The A.L.P. is at the cross roads, it either rejects the bills in the Senate and retains its credibility, or it changes its name to the Alternative Liberal Party (A.L.P.) and gives up any pretence it has of providing an alternative to the Howard government.

GENOCIDE US? NO WAY!! WE9RE THE GOOD GUYS The Bush administration9s refusal to recognise the International Court of Justices jurisdiction is a serious blow to the establishment of an international tribunal that could prosecute the crime of genocide. It9s no surprise that the current United States government has refused to ratify the decision to support the court that was made by the Clinton administration. The catalogue of atrocities committed by the United States since World War Two in the quest to protect their hegemony over both economic and military matters, makes them serious contenders to be prosecuted by the International court of Justice. Henry Kissingers current concerns about being indicted for war crimes, are a direct consequence of the genocidal policies that the Nixon administration was responsible for in Cambodia and Vietnam. The rise and rise of Pol Pot was a direct consequence of the secret war the United States conducted in Cambodia. The United States "low intensity warfare" program in Asia, Africa and Latin America has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of non combatants. Some of the most brutal regimes on the planet in the second half of the 20th century from Papa Doc9s reign of terror in Haiti to Mabutu9s dictatorial regime in Zaire were bankrolled and supported militarily by successive United States administrations. The United States current war on terrorism has degenerated into a thinly disguised attempt by the United States to re-impose its authority on those countries across the globe that are no longer dependent on the United States. No wonder Bush has no intention of ratifying any agreement about any International Court that could see United States military personnel and politicians have to justify their actions before an international panel of jurists. The United States government subscribes to the simple policy that the world is divided into two camps, good and evil. Everybody who supports the United States is good and everybody who is against the United States is evil. As we all know when you fight evil you don9t let a little thing like genocide get in the way of victory, do you?

@_subject: Killer Kapitalism. 
IT9S OFFICIAL - CAPITALISM KILLS!! Capitalism kills - it9s official. A far reaching study into suicide and attempted suicide that has just been published in Australia, gives credence to the theory that capitalism kills. Around 2500 Australians commit suicide every year and another 25,000 attempt suicide in the same year. The study just released has shown conclusively that after florid psychiatric disorders, the next most common cause of suicide and attempted suicide are financial problems. The study found that financial problems, not necessarily poverty, was the second most common cause of suicide and attempted suicide in this country. Loss of a job, a business collapse and pressing debts made a far greater contribution to suicide, than emotional, or personal problems. When you analyse how important financial independence is in a capitalist society, you begin to realise how important the loss of a job or the failure of a business can be. Most peoples9 self-esteem in Western society is intertwined with their capacity to earn an income. Once they lose this ability, their life can take a rapid nosedive. Capitalism kills, not only because it creates problems associated with poverty, but because of the insecurity it breeds in individuals and the community at large. It9s a tragic indictment on the type of society we have become when people take their lives or attempt to take their lives because of financial difficulties they may face. The increasing levels of insecurity faced by an increasing number of younger and older Australians has contributed to the depression epidemic Australians face. The privatisation of life and the destruction of the collective ethic that has played such a major role in Australian society has made a significant contribution to the mental health epidemic the country faces. To think that thousands of Australians have taken their own lives or have attempted to take their own lives because of financial problems, is an indictment on the corporate sector and the governments that promote capitalism as a solution to our current economic, social and cultural problems.

@_subject: The famous jamous 
Early on Sunday an alleged terrorist cum-thief, Mahmoud abu Jamous, managed to escape from a fortified police bus. To make matters worse he was restrained with leg irons and handcuffs and was in a locked cage in the bus, which was accompanied by two other security vehicles and overseen by 10 elite Israeli prison guards.
No-one in the convoy realised that he had slipped away until a motorist called police to say he had seen sports shoes popping out of the bus's barred window as the vehicle waited for a stoplight in a northern Israeli town. The motorist then saw a man drop to the street and disappear in a flash.
It took the police 20 minutes to mobilise a search, but by that time abu Jamous was long gone.
''What else do we need to make sure prisoner Jamous leaves point A and reaches point B?" asked a columnist in the daily newspaper Ma'ariv. ''Fighter jets?"
 print {.nopr {display:none}}
For a country weary after months of terror and bloodshed, the absurdity of abu Jamous's escape provided a rare moment of levity.
''We've gone through so much. If you can, you have to laugh a bit," said Tamar Meshulan, 31, an industrial designer.
''He's probably a genius. He certainly knows his business."
But others wondered how a state that prides itself on its efficient police and security forces could be so humiliated by a criminal being transferred from one prison to another.
''Our whole society, our mind-set, our political system - everything in this country is organised around security," said Doran Rosenblum, a social commentator and columnist with the newspaper Ha'aretz.
''Yet here we have an example of a very dangerous man managing to escape in a country with the biggest army in the Middle East. It just shows how real security evades us."
But abu Jamous is no ordinary thief. According to the Israeli press his reputation is that of a ''burglar's burglar" who manages to slip into vehicles and homes without being noticed and who taunts authorities by leaving his business card, covered with fingerprints.
A year ago, abu Jamous, 24, was arrested on charges of robbing dozens of Israeli homes. As he was being brought to court he gave one of the guards a swift kick then vanished into the crowded streets. According to reports he lived in an elderly woman's flat for several weeks without her ever knowing she had a house-guest.
The newspaper Yediot Aharonot also claimed abu Jamous had joined the Fatah group of the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat, and had been helping armed Palestinians dodge security sweeps and slip past roadblocks to enter Oded Leibowitz, the driver who reported the escape, told Yediot Aharonot he could not believe his eyes.
''It was so strange that it took me some time to realise what I'd just seen. Everything seemed planned, like in a movie."
As for abu Jamous, he is apparently back at work. Three burglaries were reported on Sunday around the area where he escaped.

At Vitesse Semiconductor, executives including Louis Tomasetta, the chief executive, sold $53 million of stock in the first two months of last year, more than they had in all of 2000. Before the quarter had ended, the company cut its earnings projection by more than half, and the shares began a descent from $72 to their current price of $8.94.

A month later, with Oracle's share price steady, Mr. Ellison made his first sale of Oracle stock in almost five years, for a gain of almost $900 million. Five weeks after that, he acknowledged that Oracle's profit would miss its estimate, and the stock dropped 21 percent in one day.

Former Klansman Heading to Trial in 1963 Church Bombing That Killed Four Black Girls
By Bob Johnson Associated Press Writer
Published: May 7, 2002
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - The trial of the final suspect in a 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls has been put on hold so attorneys can study the jury pool's answers to questionnaires.
The 114 potential jurors in the trial of former Ku Klux Klansman Bobby Frank Cherry on Monday filled out the lengthy questionnaires on their opinions about race and other issues. Circuit Judge James Garrett then sent them home with instructions to return Thursday to be questioned individually by prosecutors and defense attorneys.
Cherry's trial is one of the nation's biggest pieces of unfinished business from the civil rights era. He is accused of helping other Klansmen plant a dynamite bomb outside the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, which was a downtown rallying site for demonstrators seeking an end to segregation.
The explosion blew a hole in a wall and killed the four girls, ages 11 and 14, as they prepared for a Sunday morning service on Sept. 15, 1963. It was the deadliest act of violence during the civil rights era.
Cherry, 72, could get life in prison if convicted.
"It's been a long time. It's time that this chapter comes to a close," prosecutor Doug Jones said before Garrett imposed a gag order.
Cherry was one of a group of Klansmen who came under almost immediate suspicion. However, the first prosecution in the case did not come until 1977, when Robert "Dynamite Bob" Chambliss was convicted and sentenced to prison, where he later died.
Ex-Klansman Thomas Blanton Jr. was convicted of murder last year and sentenced to prison. A fourth suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1994 without being charged.
Cherry was supposed to have gone on trial with Blanton but was ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial. But after psychologists testified that Cherry was faking, the judge reversed himself and declared Cherry competent.

Commuters face random sniffer dog searches
May 7 2002
NSW public transport users could be subject to sniffer dog searches under sweeping new powers for the state's police that come into effect this weekend.
The new regulations will allow police with sniffer dogs to carry out random drug searches on suspects using trains or buses on selected public transport routes.
Searches also will be carried out at stations, on platforms or any other stopping places under the plan.
Police Minister Michael Costa said the dogs will be used on train routes out of Central and heading to Bondi, Campbelltown, Nowra, Sutherland, Cronulla, Penrith, and Newcastle.
Random searches will be conducted at designated bus terminal and interchanges, including Grafton, Kempsey, Albury and Goulburn.
''These are the routes police intelligence have indicated would best utilise the drug dogs in a random fashion," Mr Costa told reporters today.
''Effectively, it would be the bulk of CityRail stations."
When asked whether the entire CityRail network was covered by the new regulations, Mr Costa replied: ''At this stage".

"...agriculture is "the indispensable basis of civilization," and "liberation is impossible without its dissolution." In the most developed capitalist nations, cities are home to the majority of the population, the separation of people from the land is nearly total, and agriculture is carried out as an intensely industrialized process. But practically no one, including Zerzan, imagines that either cities or agriculture could be abandoned overnight. A transition there would certainly have to be, and it would probably be a prolonged process undertaken, if history is any indicator, in the teeth of determined counterrevolutionary efforts aimed at the restoration of the old social order (unless the present ruling elites simply throw in the towel peacefully a seemingly unlikely but not impossible scenario). Would we then be anticipating a withering away of agriculture, to replace the Marxists' "withering away of the state"? The abolition of work is a more flexible idea and is probably more likely to catch on with the plebeian multitudes than calls to abolish civilization and technology. But there is a certain utopian maximalism in this as well. These ideas might serve better as stars to navigate by, while we sail on Fourier's seas of lemonade, seeking our Northwest passage, than as actual destinations. Work can be radically minimized; it is doubtful that it can ever be entirely eliminated. As long as we're not actually living as gatherers and hunters, some production must take place. Surely there has to be a way to accomplish it without domination and coercion of our fellow human beings, or insult to the rest of nature. The "small is beautiful" idea is appealing. "Appropriate" technologies, city gardens (horticulture), and, wherever possible, the revival of artisanal rather than industrial production are possibilities. The sheer size of the earth's human population, however, might make these solutions difficult to implement under all circumstances. Even if industrial society were cut down to size right now, the regeneration of nature could take a considerable time. In the event of another devastating world war-at this moment, alas, not just possible, but likely-resulting in the destruction of much of human society, the survivors may indeed be compelled to live as primitivists.

Newspapers May Publish Photos of Officer Suspected in Rapes, Court Rules.
By SCOTT GOLD, TIMES STAFF WRITER
An appellate court Wednesday rejected a judge's decision to block the Los Angeles Times and other news organizations from publishing photographs of a San Bernardino police officer accused of raping at least 11 women.
The decision by the state's 4th District Court of Appeal took effect Last month, San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge W. Robert Fawke granted the media permission to take photographs of Ronald Allen VanRossum, 37, a 14-year San Bernardino Police Department veteran accused of raping women he encountered while on patrol. But after a defense attorney and a prosecutor protested, the judge ordered the media not to publish any of the pictures that had already been taken. The Times and the Press-Enterprise of Riverside asked the appeals court to overturn the decision, and the newspapers' petition was granted Wednesday.
"The public has a right to observe what goes on in the courts," said Alonzo Wickers, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represented The Times. "The Constitution does not give the court the authority to stop newspapers from publishing photographs that they lawfully attained. That is a well-recognized principle and it goes to the very core of the 1st Amendment's provisions for free speech and free press."
William J. Hadden, VanRossum's defense attorney, said he had hoped that blocking the publication of the photograph would protect potential jurors from being swayed. And, he said, publishing VanRossum's photo could prompt other women from the San Bernardino area to bring additional charges against the officer.
"We did not want anyone coming out of the woodwork and saying, 'Gee, I'm a victim,' based on the fact that his face is out there," Hadden said. "Both sides wanted the jury pool not to be tainted, but they also wanted to protect the integrity of the investigation that is ongoing."
Wickers said there is "no conceivable way that the mere publication of the defendant's photograph could in any way prejudice a jury pool so that 12 impartial jurors could not be found in a county with 2 million residents."
He said there is a significant public interest in publishing VanRossum's photo, giving "other potential victims the opportunity to come forward, perhaps because they will recognize that they were not the sole victim."
VanRossum is scheduled to be arraigned in June on more than two dozen charges associated with the rapes of 11 women. Two other women have come forward to police since those charges were filed.
VanRossum's attorney has said the officer is not guilty.

Both towers were full of people working for the banks that fund the IMF, who in turn cause 30,000 deaths a day in the southern hemisphere. He also thought Bush was a greater threat to peace than terrorism, and that the US response was more to do with fighting for an empire than for civilisation. One reader took offence to the article and contacted the thought police who obviously couldn't find anything wrong with the comments, and have discontinued their investigations.

After the fire, detainees were described as 'being at large', but a former detention officer recently contacted a Bedfordshire paper to say that she believes a group of 10 detainees who were in the prayer room were killed in the fire. Campaigners calling for an independent enquiry into the incident have so far been ignored. In what appears to be a massive cover up, witnesses to the event are being deported and 10 of the detainees have now been charged with "violent disorder." An Early Day Motion calling for an independent enquiry and the halt of deportations, has so far only been signed by 48 MP's. You can fax your MP free through  and ask them to sign EDM1048. Meanwhile Group 4 who run Yarl's Wood and Campsfield Detention Centre in Oxfordshire, are making big bucks out of making asylum seekers lives a misery. They've recently bought up Wakenhut the company that runs all of Australia's detention centres and other centres around the world with a total of 40,000 units.

For almost 14 years Kath Pettingill had waited for the call she always knew would come.
It came at 9.45pm on Wednesday. Victor Peirce was dead - shot less than 30 minutes earlier in Bay Street, Port Melbourne, in what police suspect was a drug-related killing.
Peirce, his half-brother, Trevor Pettingill, and two family friends, Peter McEvoy and Anthony Farrell, were charged and acquitted over the 1988 murders of two police in Walsh Street, South Yarra.
Constables Steven Tynan and Damian Eyre were ambushed when they went to a routine check on a stolen car on October 12. Investigators maintain the four killed the police as a revenge attack after Peirce's best friend, Graeme Jensen, was shot by armed robbery squad detectives in Narre Warren 13 hours earlier.
Kath Pettingill has known ever since how it would all end. "Without a word of a lie since every day since Walsh Street I have expected this to happen to Victor or Trevor," she said yesterday.
She is no stranger to crime, violence or grief. Two other sons, Dennis Allen, a man suspected of involvement in 11 deaths, and Jamie Pettingill died young. She had six sons and a daughter. All had criminal records.
Mrs Pettingill has drug-related convictions and at one point was the most influential woman in Melbourne's underworld. She released her own book, appropriately titled, The Matriarch.
Yesterday she spoke of the loss of her son: "I'm not asking for public sympathy, we'll shed our own tears. I'm going to bury him in peace."
She said that although retired from crime, she would be checking with old contacts to see who killed Peirce. "There is an old saying, You can run, but you can't hide."
Mrs Pettingill said her son had given up crime and had worked on the docks for four years to support his family.
"If this had happened to Dennis (his late elder brother), well fair enough, but not Victor. If I had been there I would have taken a bullet for him. He's got kids and grandkids."
Following Walsh Street, Peirce became the man police loved to hate. After his Supreme Court acquittal for the Walsh Street killings, D24 broadcast a message, "All units are warned, keep yourself in control."
On many station notice boards was a cartoon. It showed a policeman face down being kicked by a group of so-called enemies, including the government, media and judges. One of the figures was labelled "Victor Peirce."
Mrs Pettingill said that after the acquittal she believed Peirce would be killed by police but she accepts that he was murdered by fellow gangsters.
Last night The Age contacted police who had dealings with Peirce over the past 20 years. None were upset by his death.
One of the key witnesses against the Walsh Street four was Peirce's wife Wendy, who was to give key evidence against her husband. But before the trial she changed sides and refused to implicate Peirce. She was later jailed for perjury.
The Peirces were reunited after he was acquitted. The youngest of their four children, Vinnie, was named after the Walsh Street trial judge, Justice Frank Vincent. He was born in prison while his mother was still serving time.
The couple had an interesting marriage. Dennis Allen offered to shoot Wendy in the leg to assist Peirce in a bail application on compassionate grounds. "If I wasn't pregnant it would have been all right," she said. "Dennis would have known how to do it without doing too much damage."
When Peirce was released from prison in 1998 after serving six years for drug trafficking, Mrs Peirce said she was confident he had reformed. "He is not a monster. When he gets out we just want to be left alone . . . He is a family man with family values. He is one of the best fathers you could see. No one has anything to fear from us.
"He has had six years to think about it. He has a job lined up. I know that he is finished with crime. He just wants to live quietly with his family."
Her hopes ended in Bay Street. Peirce, 43, was shot dead and left in his 1993 maroon Commodore about 9.15pm.
There are several reasons police believe the murder was planned and executed by an experienced shooting team of two hitmen.
Although the killing was carried out in a busy street, the pair did it quickly without drawing attention to themselves.
The gunman appeared confident and calm. He stepped from the passenger-side door of a light coloured mid-80s Commodore and fired several shots into the body of Peirce.
The killer then hopped back into the car and the driver took off towards Beaconsfield Parade, staying within the speed limit and obeying all road rules.
Police say the car was probably stolen and almost certainly picked because it was plain: no fat tyres, hot motor or garish stripes - nothing a witness could remember.
Peirce had earlier had a coffee with Wendy and their teenage daughter, who walked home just before Peirce was shot.
Port Melbourne was once the toughest suburb in Melbourne, the centre of activities for the notorious Painters and Dockers Union. But in recent years it has become a trendy location.
Peirce, his wife and children, had moved from a drab house in a plain street in Rowville to a more upmarket home in Port Melbourne.
He had a job as a crane operator on the docks and wanted to be closer to work, where he often started on the pre-dawn shift.
Peirce always remained close to crime. He became a bodyguard for Italian crime figure and market identity Frank Benvenuto who was shot dead in 2000.
Police have been told that Peirce took out a contract to kill a man connected to the Melbourne cocaine industry. The man has alleged that Peirce fire-bombed his car.
He was also alleged to have been behind a car bombing at the docks.
He had vast gangland contacts, including Mark Militano, Frank Valastro, Jedd Houghton, Graeme Jensen and Gary Abdallah, all of whom were killed by Detectives believe Peirce had moved into the pill and powder market - amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy.
The drug squad had seized a pill press used to make amphetamine-based fake ecstasy. They had been told it had been owned by Peirce.
One theory police are investigating is that Peirce was in Bay Street to collect money from a cocaine deal and was in an underworld rip-off.
Retired standover man Mark "Chopper" Read expressed no surprise at Peirce's "I knew him since he was 14," Read said.
"I had nothing against him but he thought selling drugs was a legal occupation. "These blokes have never worked out that there is no place for middle-aged gangsters."
Former undercover policeman Lachlan McCulloch, who infiltrated the Pettingill-Peirce clan, said they were dangerous and unpredictable.
In the operation, codenamed Earthquake, Mr McCulloch bought amphetamines, cannabis and heroin worth more $130,000 from the group. As a result, 15 people, including Trevor and Kath Pettingill, were arrested.
"They were not smart people. Victor was a real low-life," he said yesterday.
Mr McCulloch was also to arrest Peirce for his smallest crime - shoplifting a jar of instant coffee valued at $1.66.
"It was at an Asian grocers in North Melbourne. When we got there, we found 10 Asians sitting on top of him. He wasn't going anywhere.
"I found him to be a dill. If he was organised crime, Melbourne's pretty safe."
Ironically, Peirce's killers selected a light-coloured Holden Commodore for the job - the same type of vehicle used to lure Constables Tynan and Eyre to Walsh Street.
Like Constable Tynan in 1988, Peirce was rushed to the Alfred Hospital.
And as in the case of Constable Tynan, surgeons could do nothing to save him.

MAY DAY! MAY DAY! MAY DAY!
Hundreds of thousands of American workers, increasingly
determined to resist subjugation to capitalist power,
poured into a fledgling labor organization, the
Knights of Labor.
Beginning on May 1, 1886, they took to the streets to demand
universal adoption of the 8-hour day. Chicago was the center of
the movement. Workers there had been agitating for an 8-hour
day for months, & on the eve of May 1, 50,000 were already
on strike. 30,000 more swelled their ranks the next day,
bringing most of Chicago manufacturing to a standstill.
Fears of violent class conflict gripped the city. No violence
occurred on May 1 -- a Saturday -- or May 2. But on Monday,
May 3, a fight involving hundreds broke out at McCormick
Reaper between locked-out unionists & non-unionist workers
McCormick hired to replace them. The Chicago police,
swollen in number & heavily armed, quickly moved in with
clubs & guns to restore order. They left four
unionists dead &many others wounded.
Angered by the deadly force of the police, a group of
anarchists, led by August Spies & Albert Parsons, called on
workers to arm themselves & participate in a massive protest
demonstration in Haymarket Square on Tuesday evening, May 4.
The demonstration appeared to be a complete bust, with only
3,000 assembling. But near the end of the evening, an individual,
whose identity is still in dispute (possibly a police agent
provocateur), threw a bomb that killed seven police &
injured 67 others.
Hysterical city & state government officials rounded up eight
anarchists, tried them for murder, & sentenced them to death.
On 11 November 1887, four, including Parsons & Spies, were
executed. All of the executed advocated armed struggle & violence
as revolutionary methods, but their prosecutors found no evidence
that any had actually thrown the Haymarket bomb. They died
for their words -- not their deeds.
250,000 people lined Chicago's street during Parson's funeral
procession to express their outrage at this gross miscarriage of
For radicals & trade unionists everywhere, Haymarket became a
symbol of the stark inequality & injustice of capitalist society.
The May 1886 Chicago events figured prominently in the decision
of the founding congress of the Second International (Paris, 1889)
to make May 1, 1890 a demonstration of the solidarity & power
of the international working class movement. May Day has been a

Each footstep taken in this society bristles with privileges, &
is marked with a bloodstain; each turn of the government

ASIO could detain and strip-search children as young as 10 under sweeping new powers proposed for the domestic spying agency, a parliamentary committee heard yesterday.
It could also interrogate detainees for up to 48 hours straight without providing access to a lawyer.
Law Council of Australia spokesman Michael Rozenes QC told the committee that changes to ASIO's governing legislation, prompted by the events of September 11, could lead to unprecedented abuses of power.
The Law Council and civil liberties groups say the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is in danger of becoming a secret police force.
But ASIO director-general Dennis Richardson said changes were needed to fight international terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda.
Under the new rules ASIO could detain not only terrorist suspects but anyone suspected of knowing about a possible terrorist threat.

Several police officers were injured, police spokesman Christian Matzdorf said. He said he knew of no injuries to demonstrators. By midnight, police reported the situation under control.
Berlin's gritty Kreuzberg district has been the focus of riots on May Day and the night before that have become a fixture in the capital over the past 15 years.
About 10,000 people gathered at night around bonfires in a park several kilometres to the north to mark St Walpurgis Night, recalling a medieval rite of spring believed to scare off witches. Firefighters were called out to douse a trash fire set on a nearby thoroughfare.
WALPURGISNACHT. Witches, warlocks & demons hold revels in
Harz Mountains. Whole towns rush into streets, making as much
noise as possible. Church bells ring, bonfires are lit. In British
Isles, a scapegoat is chosen by lots and burned, hobby horse parades
are held, chasing evil away until Mid-summer's Night.

They came back to the WTC to finish what they started.They should have been assisted in this with trial information from the 1st attempt.Is DC now unfinished business? Has there been more invaluable intelligence learnt?
RR is close to desirable targets,especially the Pentagon.If caucasians took the plane using more people to flush out marshalls and shaped charges to blow doors then it should be relativly simple to finish the job on DC.

Is anarchism,where does "libertarianism",especially as defined here get off trying to rip off classic anarchism? Your a shameless thief Mongo.
