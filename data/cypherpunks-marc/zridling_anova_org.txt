As the hint says, use the label function.  Here's how:
1.  From menu File->New->Labels
2. a. insert ANY text in the Label Text box,
   b. In brand, select Avery Letter Size (or appropriate size)
   c. in Type, select something like 5371 Business Card - White
3.. click the Options tab
   a. Select entire page option
   b. select Synchronize contents
   c. Click New Document button
4. Select the top-left frame, insert objects and text and format your
business card, then click the floating button that says Synchronize
Voil=E1! you have 10 business cards on the page, ready to print!
