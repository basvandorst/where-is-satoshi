I love to use fabric softener with my laundry detergent to make my clothes feel soft and smell great. The The consistency of using a single scent for all your laundry needs                   So, if you like the refreshing fragrance of Mountain Spring scent, try using Mountain Spring Tide (available in                   powder or liquid) coupled with Mountain Spring Downy (available in a liquid or sheet) to ensure that the scent is                   consistent from the start of the wash to when you wear your clothes. In fact, Downy makes using a liquid fabric                   softener easy with the Downy Ball, allowing you to give your family that freshness and softness you expect from                   a liquid.

                For good cleaning, load your washing machine carefully and select the proper wash cycle and water                 level for the load you are doing. Many common laundry problems can be prevented by filling your                 washer in the following manner. First, turn the washing machine on. Then MEASURE your detergent                 and pour it into the machine as it fills. Finally, add your clothing. Be sure not to overload                 your washer as the clothing needs room to circulate to obtain maximum cleaning.For more

This month's featured neighbor is Linda from Erlanger, KY:
                        We celebrated Thanksgiving dinner at my house this year. Everything went                         great, except for the red wine stains left on my linen tablecloth. I don't                         want to ruin my favorite holiday linens! How do I even begin to remove                         these stains?
                        Linda, red wine stains may be somewhat intimidating at first glance. Try                         these tips to help remove those stain remains from your precious linens.
If possible, try to treat the stain immediately by using a cloth to blot                   (not rub) as much of the liquid spill as you can. Make sure you work from                   the outside in, to keep the stain from spreading even further. Remember                   that time is of the essence, and the faster you get to the stain, the                   easier it will be to remove.
                  However, if you aren't lucky enough to treat the stain early (as many of                   us aren't), there is still hope. As a standard rule, before treating any                   garment, always refer to the care label instructions first. Protect your                   colored linens by pre-testing the effects of these stain removal                   techniques on a hidden area of the item. Now, onto removing those                   wine stains!                   First, rinse the garment in cold water to dilute the stain. Then, soak                   up to 30 minutes in a plastic bucket, with 1/2 dose Tide® with Bleach                   per gallon of water. Weight the item with a white towel to keep submerged,                   and don't forget to discard soak solution prior to laundering. Finally,                   wash in 1 dose of Tide® with Bleach in warm water. Air-dry your table                   linen and repeat procedure if necessary.
