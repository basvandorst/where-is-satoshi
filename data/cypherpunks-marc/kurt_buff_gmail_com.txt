the ratification of the Constitution:
No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.
         ---Thomas Jefferson: Draft Virginia Constitution, 1776.
Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are
in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot
enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are
armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that
can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States. A military force, at
the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people
perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power,
and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the
execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.
         ---Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the
Federal Constitution (Philadelphia 1787).
I particularly like the following:
*Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we
shall turn our arms each man gainst his own bosom. Congress have no power
to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of
the soldier, are the birthright of an American...[T]he unlimited power of
the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments,
but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.
       ---Tenche Coxe, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.*
The whole of that Bill [of Rights] is a declaration of the right of the
people at large or considered as individuals...[I]t establishes some rights
of the individual as unalienable and which consequently, no majority has a
right to deprive them of.
         ---Albert Gallatin to Alexander Addison, Oct 7, 1789, MS. in N.Y.
Hist. Soc.-A.G. Papers, 2.
[C]onceived it to be the privilege of every citizen, and one of his most
essential rights, to bear arms, and to resist every attack upon his liberty
or property, by whomsoever made. The particular states, like private
citizens, have a right to be armed, and to defend, by force of arms, their
rights, when invaded.

People arrange themselves in hierarchies all the time, and it's no

these extra "winners" get a salary? Is the salary for the district
divided amongst the winners? Do any of them get assistants?
Seems rather complicated.
Instead, I propose a much simpler system: It's long past time to
vastly increase the number of Representatives, and limit them to 1
paid assistant. If we were to apportion House members as originally
conceived (something like 1 Representative per 100k eligible voters),
we're certainly have a lot more representative House (as it were),
with lots more members to vote for, and much smaller voting districts.
More efficient? Oh heaven forbid! But certainly more representative.

Authoritarianism (of which corporatism, communism, fascism, socialism,

resources is a crime, and that the hierarchs are justified in killing
anyone who believes differently.
Remember - when a law is passed, it's with the firm understanding that
anyone who refuses to obey it is worth killing. Therefore, more laws

Three quotes from a man of wisdom, which seem apropos here:
The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern. Every
class is unfit to govern. - Lord Acton
It is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be
oppressed by a majority. For there is a reserve of latent power in the
masses which, if it is called into play, the minority can seldom
resist. But from the absolute will of an entire people there is no
appeal, no redemption, no refuge but treason. - Lord Acton
There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of
it. - Lord Acton

It's worth keeping in mind Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy:
"In any bureaucratic organization there will be two kinds of people:
those who work to further the actual goals of the organization, and
those who work for the organization itself. Examples in education
would be teachers who work and sacrifice to teach children, vs. union
representatives who work to protect any teacher including the most

Focus, man, focus. Yes, biowarfare is real, and has been practiced by
governments and individuals. In this case, the evidence isn't there,
any more than was evidence in 1918.
Let's keep this on target. The US government, at least, did not, and
probably the Chinese did not either, absent better evidence,
deliberately create the virus or infect anyone. We can take lots of
issue with how it's been handled, but we've seen no evidence in this
case that the infection is deliberate. Nor do we see, at least in the
US (China is up for debate on this point), the government withholding
care. Poor planning and execution, yes, and Trump trying to downplay
it, yes, and Trump trying to keep proceedings secret, yes, but not
much else.

Consider, if you will, a possible outcome of the current bio-crisis.
(I want it over, swiftly, and with as little damage to humanity as
possible, I really do, but it doesn't look promising at the moment)
We're seeing some congress critters self-quarantining. I think it
likely that more will do the same.
And yet, they (and some of you, even it not not so much me) want the
work of the Congress to continue.
How to resolve this?
One solution is teleconferencing. Votes, meetings, etc., could be
carried out this way, and work (such as it is) can get done. Think of
the transparency (if not voluntarily achieved, perhaps attained with
the help of some volunteer work by technologically sophisticated
persons of flexible morals).
If this goes on for a while, there's no reason why they (the
accumulated they of Congress and staff) wouldn't become acculturated
and accustomed to this new way.
At that point, what's to stop the congress critters and their remoras,
with suitable encouragement, to permanently relocate to their own
It would certainly make lobbying more difficult, being in view of
their constituents, rather than sequestered in the summer hellhole
that is DC.

I slightly misspoke - the mission of government is to prosecute crime,
not prevent it, because ultimately prevention is impossible.
But here we see the problem with your scope of government - everything
unfortunate becomes defined as a tragedy, and therefore legitimizes
all government intrusion into the private sphere.
War, that is, invasion by a foreign power, is a species of crime.
Illness is not.
