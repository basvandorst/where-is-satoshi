I believe I was trying to do what Martin was talking about. (I think)
  On the other hand if I was trying to do your latex code with lyx
  what would be the basic steps. I tried entering the latex code
  to see what is does but kept getting errors so gave it up.

  ps I couldn't cut paste the above code into lyx. It would go everywhere
  except where I tried to paste it and then left out the line-feeds and I
  eventually had to type it in manually.
