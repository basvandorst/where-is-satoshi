Hello cypherpunks
This is our final notice to you that payment is now due on your domains.  A list of domains associated with your email address is attached to the end of this email notice.
Some domain owners did not receive the first notice due to some problems with our email servers.  Also regular surface mail service has been slow due to 9/11 related problems with delivery in North America.  So please don't delay get your agreements and invoices filed as soon as possible so you do not loose your domain(s).  Your domain agreements must be received by us no later then April 8th.
IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR YOUR DOMAIN PLEASE DISREGARD THIS NOTICE.
Please visit our billing center at:

If you have lost your password please visit the registry at:
  Select the .GOD registry and then click on the "Lost Password" link and enter your email address to retrieve your password(s).
