Mo, I wish your student great success. I will definitely take a look! I expect the UI for a plugin to  be quite different to that of a web app. I've chosen not to build a plugin or a single platform app for obvious reasons, though it is nice to know that there are efforts in these directions that may assist my own in part. Here's the plan to create ease of use: taking note of the UIs of existing tools, collaborating with experienced UI designers, and making use of an extensive background and contacts in UI test.
