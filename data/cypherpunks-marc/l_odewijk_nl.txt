What problem are we solving, exactly? No eavesdropping is simple enough. No
MITM is not preventable without information known to come from the intended
source. Presently we have "all knowers" called certificate authorities. We
trust them as a collective not individually. Their security depending on
their collective is a fatal mistake. The idea of an all-knower is very,
very convenient for the design of these systems.
Yet, is it required? Surely there must be a distributed, not decentralized*
approach that works to spread information with certainty.
The problem then lies with the link between the security record (signature,
proof of private key) and the name record (DNS). Simply signing the DNS
records would be enough, then the DNS records must be provided properly.
This is moving the problem. Yet, it is moving the problem to the DNS
provider, which also suffers from the centralization weakness that persists
in such decentralized arrangements.
Having a DHT in which several known friends are anchored might allow that
DHT to "vote" on the subject. Every node will accumulate the votes from its
trusted neighbors and vote on what the majority agrees on. Heuristic, but
typically functional. And we swat two flies with one blow. SDNS, (Secure
Distributed Name Server) a mapping from name to signed machine location
In this future the overhead for security is as big as the signature for the
SDNS record, and the encryption and decryption on the data itself.

decentralized. I believe that, in practice, we could better describe it as

This is a bit self delusional. "Use your opponent's strength against him",
sway pools to support your cause. Or better yet: start pools with possibly
negative profit. Pay-per-share but you payout a tad more than you actually
could. That way people will consider your service the most profitable, ergo
the best, and flock to give you shares at an extremely discounted rated (it
only costs you whatever you add to it).
Better yet: force existing pool owners a: out of business, b: to support
Better yet: subvert pool managing computers! Make the machines support you!
Or do MITM attacks to get the shares instead of the pools!
Maybe just subverting the developers (enough are US based, hint hint) to
write a teensy exploit.
Just cracking the central exchanges and everything that accepts Bitcoin
will also cause a rather big stir. A small division breaking into
bitcoin-accepting services and selling the bitcoins will lower the price
directly and decrease trust significantly.
Visa and Mastercard not providing services to Bitcoin accepting customers
would also be quite effective.
Bascially, the cost is lower legally than it is otherwise. And a 51% attack
can be solved with a trust model, should people wish to do so.
Lastly you must imagine there's plenty of computing power available to most
governments on that list. Temporarily using that power for the time of the
attack is a fairly good idea (depending on what you want to do with a 51%
attack), and not the full price at all. A cost/hr would be much more useful

The alternative answer is that you're dealing with two problems. Political
problems, from gag-order-ish affairs to licenses to prevent you from doing
it, and operational problems, the implanted code, the coerced backdoor.
Political problems call for political solutions. Distributing everything is
an approach to evade them. Just like we can write code we can write a legal
structure for our entities. Mega is  doing just that. Put the right thing
in the right country, evade certain punishable things but deal with their
use cases. Basically you're looking at a system of laws, and you're
programming a way to not be subject to them. You musn't forget that laws
move, however slowly. (like dealing with changing APIs)
Operational problems are historically dealt with by controlling the people
working on the project. You should get those with iron loyalty and
confidence in the greater good you're doing. That's nearly impossible to be
sure about and NSL-type-things make it excruciatingly hard for them. Then
layering, rounds of approval, people approving in different nations, etc.

contain backdoors. Formal proofs are touchy and hard to read. Code gets
complicated and large. Backdoors are elaborate and sneaky. But the
political problems can be dealt with. And minimizing the code that can
contain backdoors is also a good idea.
You could also go for the never-done-in-production testing method where you
have two (or more) distinct implementations of the same thing, and you see
if the results are totally correct. That way someone would have to hide two
backdoors, for two different programs, in the same payload without breaking
the program the backdoor is not meant for.
There's ways. It's a lot of work.

2013/9/22 Tony Arcieri I, personally, find that a most commendable and remarkable fact. To use DES
with longer keying (and more rounds) is, to this very day, a solid choice.
It makes one wonder why the longer keys weren't used before, doesn't it
make you feel safer that your secret will remain that way until long after
you die?
Performance issues in cryptography are an interesting problem. Both the
safety and inconvenience are in it. It is my preposition that the security
has been minimized too often, and too much.
Longer keys, stronger crypto. This is what I would like to see.
I still think simplicity is something largely ignored in the algorithms.
DES is a *fairly* simple arrangement, AES definitely doesn't improve upon
it. It still seems strange to me that *tricks*, because that's what they
are, require so much trickery.
A simple purpose, a simple solution. You'd imagine.
The simplest algorithm would be the simplest trick to figure out, to undo
the trickery of. Anything more complex would be more difficult to undo, but
will it be more computationally expensive? Are we increasing human effort
or computer effort?
Regarding this topic: typically I'm always disappointed in groups by two
things. The first is the capacity of the group. The second is the kind of
effort being performed to achieve a goal. Usually groups display much
lesser capabilities than individuals do. And the groups will not perform
outside their parameters, meaning they do much less than you'd think they
do to achieve their goals.
I doubt AES is subverted through partaking in the contest. But as those at
the competition I wonder about the abilities of the immense amounts of
cryptographers possibly employed at the NSA. They're careful though. Maybe
we won't ever find out.

Public key depends on high level math. That math has some asymetric
property that we can use to achieve the public-private key relationships.
The problem is that the discovery of smarter math can invalidate the
asymetry and make it more symetrical. This has to do with P=NP, which is
also less trivial than a first explaination makes it seem. If it becomes
even effectively symetrical (P is that) it will stop having the nice
useable property.
Symetric cryptography does a much easier thing. It combines data and some
mysterious data (key) in a way that you cannot extract data without the
mysterious data from the result. It's like a + b = c. Given c you need b to
find a. The tricks that are involved are mostly about sufficiently mixing
data, to make sure there's enough possible b's to never guess it correctly
and that all those b's have the same chance of being the one b. Preferably
even when you have both A and C, but that's really hard.
So I'd say Bruce said that in an effort to move to more well understood
cryptography. It is also a way to move people towards simply better
algorithms, as most public key systems are very, very bad.

(*should be) isolated from NSA developments and should be at about public
level. Russia might not be that ignorant though, best stick with Cuba. Iran
and North Korea should be 100% monitored and likely don't run any Tor
nodes. This is on the basis of their hostility towards America (&friends)
and with that the assumption of isolation from their developments and no
cooperation. China is hard to judge but might also be better than anything
else. Hong Kong might be the best in China. HK is in China's womb yet, like
a baby, it isn't China.
All of the less-than-stable Africa seems like a good target. Too busy
running crime or trying to keep stuff together to have developed
international spy agencies. South Africa might have an agreement with GB/US
(doesn't actually matter which) so I'd avoid them. The northern
"dictator-band" has been/is being disassembled. The US is likely only
involved to protect its interests now that the obedient dummy dictators are
gone. That means there's no telling what the status of surveillance is, but
it might be very good (iow: absent). Regardless the Internet connections
are unreliable and the security will likely be US-colors soon enough.
Asia except for China is hard to judge (for me). Taiwan (aka "Republic of

trouble getting recognition/allegiance due to the People's Republic of
China.  No clue about security allegiances. Can imagine it's been declaring
its independence so hard it doesn't have any, and might be a good target.

Indonesia group). (There's quite some difference between those countries,
but I *think* they still end up in the same category). Singapore is a total

are both very mixed in their level of development to a point where
mass-surveillance just doesn't make sense. They're also nuclear powers,

powers. Probably good exit points.
All the middle east is probably bad because of oil/militairy interests.
Special mention of Isreal as being extremely bad.
Turkey too is subject to military interests and wants to be EU and whatnot
so let's just avoid them. EU is all surveillance or wants to be
surveillance. Eastern Europe has the developmental backlog that might've
caused them to push it further down the to-do list. Greece, Italy, Spain,
might be so busy not going bankrupt that they've skimped on the
surveillance. Morocco and Algeria are oddballs, close to the EU but nothing
else (deserts) they might've not had purpose for surveillance, yet have
better connections than the rest of Africa. (Tunisia?)
The world feels pretty good about the Nordic countries but I think they
just tie into the US+ spynet so that makes them useless. Iceland's small
population and distance to everything made it really nice, now I'm not so

how that'll work out. The population is small enough to be smart. I suppose
they're observed in any non-politically approved but still possible way.

bandwidth too. Quite like fiber, except for the ideal transmission.
And that highlights the problems. You have to keep the laser pointed, that

This agreement has led to laws. These laws are executed by a blind

microphone's function? How is the microphone guaranteed to have "its
microphone function"? Is a microphone input just the microphone's jack or
an actual soundwave-modulated-magnetic-power-factor?
In either case it's also a semantic non sequitor. If someone plays a darn
loud sine wave in the serverroom you can be sure the microphone will
replicate it. It'd be doable to make any microphone always output it's
maximum value, through a plenty of means. The sad thing is that it's sound,
so it might even be doable at distance!
(scenario: people breaking into a running-but-physically-controlled server
through manipulation of it's random numbers)
I think an internal radioactive source such as a smoke alarm makes great
sense. Be wary to isolate it very well to prevent outside interference. If
it just goes to MAXINT if someone holds his cube of madam curie next to the
server's case it'd be a shame.
 Bell: wouldn't such a ring oscillator aggregate be subject to
patterns? If you have something that can create more out of fewer pieces of
randomness, isn't there plenty bad-randomness-sources to go on?
 Callas:
How is this random generator affected by CPU Interrupts? It seems to be a
feature added for "more randomness", but given interrupts are far from
guaranteed (especially in problematic systems) you cannot depend upon them.
Especially because random numbers are harder on smaller systems I'm not
sure I'd call this solution elegant.
I believe stir-back is not always possible but a very strong feature. If
you can always stir-back, can't you always generate something fairly random
by simulating a x-times-stir-back? If you can't, how can you trust your
stir-backs to be spaced enough for your -x-times-stir-back to not happen
Lastly I feel your way of dealing with the pool-distiller model is finicky.
If you hash a pool your hash will be able to fold onto itself very often
and bits of entropy in different places can have different effects. You're
placing an unusual amount of faith in your hash function on it being
perfect. Diffusion with a partially known sourcetext is very, very murky
business. And with predictable data going into your pool you're essentially
creating a probably partially known plaintext. That's complex, and that'll
do you good, but it is not the kind of nice randomness you'd go for.
A suggestion I'd like to make is a laser & light strength measurement unit.
Neatly self contained and accurate enough it can measure the bending of
spacetime itself. I suppose anything even nearly that accurate will measure
it's direct environment's noise so well it all doesn't matter anyway.
Something like Delta(cpu_magneticness_mid_cycle) would do wonders. Anything
dependent on the activity of the computer itself gives problems with people
manipulating what the computer is doing. More rough it could measure minute
changes in the movement and heat of flowing air.

Why does the DHT require a cryptographic quality hash? I agree that SHA1 is
too weak to be cryptographic, but a DHT is merely finding chains of other
nodes. Worst that can happen is the adversary manipulating you into
connecting to them with higher chance. Given the whole friend-to-friend

Far as I know there's no deep-communication tactics except

attack surface and functionality.
The greatest problem with plugins is that I'm never sure how they deal with

I think Retroshare could well be replaced by something alike Tor, but not
Tor, then to have some quantity of programs connect to it to do interesting

So, why use Retroshare instead of a Tor hidden service with standard chat
relay? Because Tor is a target and RetroShare is not. And because
Retroshare actually does a lot more than relay chat.

Regarding general disagreement with Bitcoin: there's really no point
resisting mathematics. And at this point the deflation of Bitcoin is about
as tied to a mathematical certainty as reality ever gets. It's a market
thingy. Early adopters get *huge* advantages. Knowledge presses the price
harder than risk. Anyway.
Having multiple Bitcoins isn't much going to solve your problems. No other
currency will be without it's own flavor of problems. As a rule of thumb:
if the math is sound but it seems illogical, check yourself. If you can't
check the math, don't trust it.
Having multiple cryptocurrencies would be nice. But Ripple for example
sucks in comparison.
Again, this thread is not about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
Regarding assassination markets I don't think this particular one isn't too
special. I also think any form of assassination should be communally
prevented. Of course anonymity, which always exists in some form, makes it
impossible. I'm not sure making it as in-your-face as Tor+Bitcoin is doing

This is the kind of scheme that could last indefinitely. I visualize a

tip flows towards the creator of the system. All the pieces higher in the
piramid get some air too. In bitcoin the hole at the tip is closed.
Although the pressure on the top increases (there's some gravity effect)
there is no money dissapearing.
There's a significant illusion that everyone involved in the system could
"cash out" for a certain price. Market dynamics don't allow such an event
to occur though.
You'll note that all commodities follow the same mechanism, except for
commodities being translatable to other valueable things intrisically.

Okay. Let me explain it a little bit.
Satoshi (and maybe some buddies in the very-very-early days) is (are?)
estimated to have 1.5MBTC (M for million, m for milli, k?). That's worth
about 900MEUR now. Let's make a generous assumption, that Satoshi started
working on Bitcoin right after DigiCash bankrupted (1998). That assumption
is a bucket of nonesense, I think 2/3 years would be more right.
Thebitcoin wiki
tells us he "has claimed that he has been working on Bitcoin since 2007",
the Bitcoin software was released 2009. Paper distributed in 2008.
Okay so: 1.5MBTC for 2 years. I doubt I'd have to show you that no other
scientist, no matter his contribution, got quite that amount of money for
his efforts. In fact most scientists waive what little they get because
they do not need it (their dedication is to science, not to carnal
pleasures). 1.5MBTC for 11 years is still a pretty high salary. But this is
in "employment terms".
If we compare to people like the creator of SnapChat, a hyperflawed
consequence free multimedia application (media is deleted after being
viewed for a specified amount of seconds), who's product is apperently
worth 4 billion on a functional market. We're doing okay right now, because
something far more usefull (it is) is priced at 1/4th of the price of
However if you believe Bitcoin will stay at around 600 euro's (oh wait it's
700 today already, haha) than that's quite strange. If you think it'll stay
at around 4x more (2400) than you're probably still thinking quite
strangely. See, Bitcoin has a very unusual market mechanic. And Satoshi is
rewarding himself in how much the system is used, the sum of all banks his
software replaces will be his money. But nobody is paying him directly and
his efforts are definitely not a markted good.
Why shouldn't it? Because if satoshi lives in a huge home, spending freely,
with several people assisting him in whatever whilst owning some companies
that'll do things he deems important (squirrle rescue patrol, private
police, education, art displays, helping the poor, etc) then he didn't need
this much. Having this much of what might become world wealth simply isn't
reasonable for what the money stands for. Somewhere I feel it unfair that
someone who works at the top of his abilities in a more profitable field
gets paid more, but it isn't actually unfair. But the amount of buying
power that Satoshi now represents is so exeedingly vast, and will be so
much vaster, I cannot fantom it "fair".
The best we can go for is the amount being "realistic" and "result of a
fair and honest process". And I think that because a buyer of Bitcoin has
no reason to be interested in economic or Satoshi, just in his personal
profits, we have a game-theory situation where Satoshi is paid in a way
that nobody is interested in observing. After all, every Bitcoin you buy
makes the Bitcoin scarcer at your expense and Satoshi profits. And because
of this game theory problem I don't feel there is a market-related effect
being placed on Satoshi's efforts.
The bottom line is: wealth distribution fairness was never a core design
goal of Bitcoin.

constant in some way. Best I can come up with is increasing mining payout
with the difficulty. That'll link the value of a coin to the cost of
mining, directly. Meaning you can turn electricity into coin, but not the
other way around. I suppose you'll need demurrage because else the coin
will inflate beyond making mining cost neutral, and the mining rates will
decline accordingly.

Why don't we create a distributed website catalog? It's harder, as

No. Rewriting the blockchain gives back those coin days. I imagine it's
pretty hard to use many people's coin days for the same block, whereas a
nonce to a block is very easy to communicate.
Why? If it works it works and if it doesn't it doesn't. A mix between the
two is an extremely political and complicating choice.
I'm stuck with a democracy problem. Is Plutocracy better? Is Democracy
better? Is any Obliarchy better?
I tend to think that the people are incapable of making the best choice.
Things turn into a trust/populism issue as the people thinks emotionally.
Additionally it just often lacks the domain specific knowledge for a good
Thus a form of obliarchy should be better. The selection criteria is the
real problem. Elections typically reintroduce the previous problems.
A higher level of education is a start as it correlates with domain
specific knowledge. It correlates too weakly for my taste. And it lacks
testing for critical thinking and similar skills, although they also
correlate. This also puts a pressure on determining the level of education
that isn't in the best interest of academics.
Simple intelligence testing would be preferable. But it is as of yet
impossible to accurately determine intelligence.
Wealthy is a selector that would work if it were not for a distorted
political situation and different levels of economic engagement present
even amongst the most capable human beings.
Ultimately the obliarchs can be trusted to make choices best for them, and
not the rest, in the ideal situation. Thus I feel it is not adequate.
In the end however the social/political/economical power wins anyway. Might
as well hardcode it. Even with all choices made up front a system will only
thrive with the support of people. People can be convinced and coerced with
political or economic power, or the social pressure of their peers.
The standing arguments against POS are:
* "Stake" is reverted/restored when the blockchain is rewritten
* It's a political choice, not so much a functional one
* Bitcoin days become a commodity of it's own (it is now too, as it speeds
up transactions, but it becomes something worth buying not something that's
nice to have. Can you imagine trading 1 btc for 1.2 btc and it being worth
it? Sidetracking by exchanging private keys -_-'.... )
* One's investment might change in a single trade. This might also be true
of mining, but it doesn't have to be.
* Large scale mining is traceable. This is an interesting notion, actually.
It'd seem that POS mining is more government-resistant as it does not
require large energy expenses.
I think if someone can solve the "investedness" in a certain blockchain it
gets very interesting.
The relative cost of an attack. It is also assumed that the overal usage
goes up. Mining not going down is a change I would make.
The everlasting counter argument is that money now is costlier still.
There's a simple trade between fraction of computing power devoted to
mining and security.
There's also stuff like  that, if properly
implemented, could drive down computing costs for scientific application.
I think this sort of clarity is valuable. There's a lot of stuff that needs
additional support. If it has to be trusted it is usually not called a
third party. The wealth of individuals is definitely something governments
have* a lot* of influence on.
Difficult to corner for who? Why and how do you want to distributed voting
authority, that's the ultimate question. Ideally there wouldn't be such a
thing as votes, just transactions.
Correctly is undefined. If you give people economic incentive the most
profitable choice would be the one taken. Making the voters take a choice
best for the system, thus the most profitable, might also not have
desirable results. Depending, of course, on the ultimate question.
You don't name the cost of voting. They are allowed to extend the
blockchain and get compensated for it. If they were wrong about their
extension, as defined by the mayority of extenders, their payment gets
revoked. This is enough to ensure each will apply the same rule to maximize
You incentivise becoming a greater stakeholder. I also think that people
with a lot of money will have ulterior motives. They don't just sit on
their money.
There's also interplay between many currencies and their exchange. It all
complicates the system tremendously.
The chief concern for the blockchain is ensuring a singular sequence of
transactions. Nothing else is vital. As a side effect the miners can change
the policies, but this is not a pleasant feature.
Voluntary entrance to a system is ideal. No need to run with BitcoinXKE, I
prefer BitcoinXKA. Blockchain forking does enable that. But transactions
could cross between chains where they are legitimate and it could get very
I'm worried about wanting a digital gold and getting a digital euro.
Reducing the flexibility of votes is a good means to that end. In Bitcoin a
policy change is agreed on before hand, a switchover date is arranged, etc,
in order to not lose money. That's pretty good.
You weren't and I'm not sure how this would work. If I sent in a
transaction to the network, someone else can claim reward for it? Do I get
rewarded for it?
This sounds like I'd have to re-announce my presence on the network pretty
frequently, allowing for easier tracking of participants.
ASIC time? But why override? I just change the order and that's enough.
How does POS factor into POW in this case?
I suspect reminting older blocks with more transactions would be feasible.
But you have to link to or explain how you want to do POS.
There may be legitimate incidents of accidental double spending. You're
also only fucking the recipient of the transaction, the sender has it's
trade long behind him.
It even means I could do a legitimate transaction and later destroy the
money I sent. Close but no ball. Without psuedonyms this is more feasible.
You could kill the sender's address, but that won't have much effect.

The fundamental problem here was that the guys in charge, especially the

it in the counter *without actually ever checking the vault **for years*.
Never checking if the money in the vault fits the money you owe people is a
very extreme way to put your head in the sand. This is obviously negligent,
to a point that it would fall in the category of *criminal negligence* anywhere
The reason I had faith in mtgox is knowing they use cold storage, so if
somehow the vault was draining they'd always have a wide margin to figure
out what the hell was up. Somehow they kept *all their coins* semi-live.
Meaning they could *all *get stolen.
It's *ridiculous* and I couldn't imagine such a wealthy and industry
leading company to not once have thought "maybe we should fix this".

Afterwards you seem to describe some properties you'd really like to see. I

Even when you've modeled a good ideal-world, there's still the journey
there. With Bitcoin the journey is pretty solid (we're seeing it). The
final situation is a subject of much speculation. I suspect Satoshi just
checked his own value in the final situation and decided "Awh, what the
hell", given it can't go wrong.
So, does Bitcoin have any desirable (inherent) property except that it'll
spread? Maybe, but it would only be that of cold-hearted economics. The
kind humans are exceedingly bad at. Human Failure, much more than economic
failure, causes current situations.
Human Failure is encouraged by soft-economics, as it reduces the penalty
for failure. Things like picking the wrong bank, not spreading risks, etc.
There's no course in primary school for evading Human Failure in this
aspect, even though it's the very core of humanity's current existence. Any
speculation as to why?
Either way, no currency alone will solve Human Failure. Even if Strangecoin

it will be applied wrongly in nearly every situation. It will fail less
than it should, because the "brick wall" that should be hit will also have

So how do they do that? If there's power failure on a specific box, what
happens? Are all transactions synced to disk before commit, thus minimal
rollbacks? A minimal rollback takes a very small margin of what would
happen in case of power failure on a box. Maybe they have several boxes
advocating a single transaction, so that expectible failures would never
crash a system completely.
I can imagine mitigating this by redundantly processing everything, in
which case sequence must be kept somehow and so I can't imagine it being
ridiculously fast. Maybe you mean the throughput is insane, because that'd
make more sense given the multiple months of CPU being thrown at it. If you
didn't then caching would just slow things down (most of the time).
Finance should run better on SSDs, so I imagine this is an old story.
Overall a bit confusing, and I'd love some more details! Like, why are they
even using disks when fiber and RAM might be faster and similarly reliable?

The sad part is that I got scared away from the exchange business because I
thought it would be nearly impossible to get it 100% secure. And if it were
less then 100% secure, how could I take people's money?
I spent days feeling sick because I couldn't figure out a way to do
exchanges distributed over sufficiently geographically disperse points to
avoid trouble with a single government going mad. Then I realized the
Megaupload situation means that any US-ally country is susceptible to a
planned US-exercise.
Once I found that I cannot trust maybe 150 countries in the world with the
rest being mostly unsuitable, that turned into a bit of a problem. Suddenly
you find yourself thinking about how to get servers up in Iran, Irak,
India?, Morocco?, Laos?, Vietnam?, Cuba, Russia, China, North Korea
(scratch that) and maybe Iceland and some micronations.
You're thinking you can't trust others to set up the server, and you don't
want the costs, exposure and actual unsafety that comes with visiting all
America's enemies so you'll end up shipping wholesome servers to be loaded
straight into a rack.
Then you realize you're still not physically secure. The server itself is a
hotbox of 100% exposure. It's exceedingly unusual to want a physically
dispersed leaderless secure computing cluster with hot failover of a large
portion of servers (>49% is impossible, can't determine if you're being
fucked in the BGP).
If you let the box call homes first (homes is the list of other servers) it
can use it's already present crypto to prevent any possible MITM or
listening in. So that's good. Problem is a little liquid nitrogen,
connection on a bus or firewire port, etc. is enough to make the server
bleed information faster than the Titanic ate water. So you have to cut the
firefire connections (USB is okay and convenient AFAIC) and heat-conductive
epoxy the motherboard, RAM and a good margin around the CPU too (use a
taller and wider cooler than usual). Maybe even run some wires through it
to measure breach.
I have some additional ideas that are better obscure than open, but you get
the level of obnoxious. It's still not secure yet though, and that bothers
me a lot.
Then you find out Intel's chips have all sorts of hyperintelligence on it
to allow "remote administration" which just blew my fucking mind halfway
across the galaxy. "Dear NSA, have a backdoor into any PC that has a NIC.
Thank you for making us the industry leader, Kind regards\nX\nIntel". So
I'm thinking you'll probably want the beefiest ARM processor or maybe even
AMD (have to do more research). Of course a wiretap could expose the magic
packets, to prevent the NSA from being able to launder the exploit as some
more simple hack that doesn't point the finger at them. And then their
ability here couldn't be used because they want to reserve it for, you
know, WW3 time (hey China).
Once you have your physical platform you have to make sure the software is
okay. I found that it's entirely impossible to not trust your compiler. And
the likelihood of cutting yourself is way too high with low level
languages. I've so far permitted myself to use Node.js, and I feel plenty
bad about that. You can not trust your SSL unit. You can not trust any
library or database software. But you have to, because you can't do better.
(I did go for OpenBSD, although many things required hand compilation which
I wasn't familiar with )
By now I'm a week further in worrying and researching, I'm sweating more at
night, I don't feel comfortable using my own computer anymore, I don't
understand why the world isn't a chaotic place where no computer ever is
not hacked out of it's guts. I realize it's probably because nobody is
motivated and smart enough to go through the effort, and then also doesn't
get caught except for those that'd pay a high price to hide their
capabilities, which is why you'd never notice.
Knowing all this I quite damn well decided I couldn't make a secure and
reliable centralized exchange. No distributed exchange would earn me a
profit, which I'd need to produce more software to help other people's life
better, so that wouldn't really help either. Aside from the fact that it
would not be popular because it'd be slower and less easy than a "central"
Overall I decided I respect greatly the people that take on this challenge.
This was over a year ago.
Looking at the hacks that happen I'm mostly shocked to find the level of
stupidity. Shocked as much to see how long things just go on without
significant trouble. MtGox failing because money dissapeared over the
years... That was shocking at an unbelievable level. The first thing would
be a BIG CLOCK in the office, showing total supposed amount of Bitcoin
according to the servers and the total amount supposedly in wallets
according to the Blockchain. If not that than at least an alarm on a
dedicated phone, e-mails and a message on the admin interface (if you have
one). Somehow they had none of those. I'm amazed. This is just an aspect.
They run Ubuntu (thick stack linux) and PHP (thick stack webserver), which
are illogical choices. The list goes on.
So I think I'm capable of making an exchange platform that's far better
than what's out there right now. And I will once I have time (I really
don't have it right now, life is such a fuzz).
I still question if it'd be used by anyone. But at least I can try.

sometimes intentional, and a symbol of what's wrong with it.
Sadly it's also a symbol of what's wrong with capitalism. And anarchy (as

I haven't been able to satisfy any clear conditions for being good or bad
guys. Not even for being patriots or not.
Ultimately it doesn't matter. Their jobs are inherently evil. Spying always
has been, but this is different because it involves everyone (even without
being suspect) and costs for additional invasion of privacy\surveillance is
negligible. Meaning a single person that doesn't do his/her job can ruin
the world (in *many* scenario's). Looking at Snowden there is not the kind
of security procedures to prevent it, either.
So. Are the NSA guys good guys? Well. They're the enemy of the people, as
they invade their privacy and therewith their safety. If you can be
blackmailed, studied, influenced, etc. you are weak and vulnerable.
Preaching to the choir, I guess. So I cannot call them good guys by a very
long shot.
Are the NSA guys bad guys? Well, they do anything to protect their nation
from whatever attack could happen (bad for non-US; me). They steal secrets
for their government (bad for non-US; me). They assist foreign secret
agencies in subverting or avoiding legal restrictions put in place to
protect citizens as (real/wise/elected) politicians see fit. (very bad for
non-US; me)
Uh. Yeah. I guess they're the bad guys. I usually feel like they are
soldiers on a certain mission, and so no blame comes to them. But I feel
more strongly that the organization is build to produce law-breaking,
privacy-destroying, unethical, unfriendly, aggressive, anticompetative,
distracting and confusing and ultimately just *mean* practices.
So yes: the NSA is *EVIL* to the maximum realistic extend.
The NSA's people enjoy a margin of appreciation. They're doing a job. They
have their reasons. But I do believe most of them are keenly aware of the
extremely large quantity of thoroughly unethical things their organization
is doing, and must be considered at least partially responsible.

The problem is that the general public is very slow to learn. Every step
along the way even the wise said things like "OH! The NSA said A, but
they'll *never* say B!". Then two weeks later the docs show that B has not
just been said, it'd been SCREAMED. Then the word is "But they'll never say
C!". Etc. Maybe at some point people will pick it up differently.
It also fits the media format better to drip info. A new news article every
new drip. That makes for a lot more exposure.
It's sad but true. I would *LOVE* instant full disclosure. But it just
wouldn't have the same effect. Maybe you could do selective full
disclosure, but who'd be allowed access? And who'd prevent the store of
data from being leaked again?
Additionally there's the rewriting and securing. Often documents have
person-specific typo's or sentence changes that can identify a specific
instance of a document. There was this company that wanted to use it on
e-books, rewriting "good" to "not bad", etc.
Anyway, mixed bag regarding full disclosure. I think this is easier, safer
and reaches the general public better and as such it's the right choice.

Exhaustive list of possibilities (please extend where possible):
A Did not know
B Did not care
C Felt like it would negatively impact the NSA's (legitimate) functioning
D Didn't get around to it yet
E Snowden is an unconventional NSA set up
F Snowden's documents are not recent enough
A, is interesting, as it would show that the NSA has levels of secrecy and
secret data that go further than what they had so far. Something above "TOP
SECRET" should probably exist, and Snowden didn't find it. This actually
makes a lot of sense to me, so it might well be it.
B, he might think it's not very interesting. Using 0-days should be old-hat
and expected. Disclosing specific exploits would not stop the bleeding, the
NSA would just find new ones. He might even consider 0-day hoarding
acceptable business, just not the mass employment of them.
C, he's often maintained a sort of "I'm coming out to the public with this,
but I'm very sorry to hurt the US in a way"- kind of attitude. It would
definitely cripple the NSA if he released novel and important bugs. Think
of how hard it would be to hack-back at China!
D, There's some scheduling going on to maximize impact. He might release
the "0-day-exploit list that endangers live as we know it, and the NSA did
nothing" later, when attention dies down again.
E, Maybe the NSA have become a common thing in popular culture and they
dislike their image of being a completely opaque organization with
potentially unlimited power. So now they are sharing information about the
"outer shell" of the organization, a sort of facade. Meanwhile it seems
like the world is crushing down upon them.
In a few years their image will be renewed. Everyone will think "The NSA
was not that unlimited in it's capabilities and worked very hard. Now that
they have rules and limits it will all be okay". And with that a whole new
level of FUD will have been achieved. Making people believe they are the
evil you know.
Of course, this is religious level conspiracies. And of course, that's
exactly the level the NSA would start to accept. They're the information
and espionage experts. If anyone could pull this off, it'd be them.
(Didn't the CIA/NSA own the media? Don't they still? This might be easier
than you'd expect)
F, I couldn't find exactly to which date his documents go. Heartbleed was
merged December 31 2011 (lonely night? sneaky vacation timing?). Assuming
the NSA checks patches (ofc they do) they should've found it in Jan 2012.
Snowden. Ah. Found it. "reenwald began working with Snowden in either
February[113] or in April after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New
York City, at which point Snowden began providing documents to them both"
That'd be April 2013.
He still might've stolen the documents earlier, but who knows?

And that last one is just as intended and a good feature. In a way you can
say that your fee buys you security, by buring your transaction under a
certain amount of hashes. Now there is money out of nowhere paying for a
whole load (maybe around 60x) more security than you paid for. That's a
good thing because Bitcoin is (used to be?) kind of small and thus
hackable, and is now (maybe around 60x) less hackable.
The question of who pays for that is peculiar as it seems in many ways as
if money comes out of nowhere. The complexity of supply and demand does not
nessarily change the value (although supply might correlate with amount in
existence) of the coins as they increase in quantity. I would say that
"newcomers" that push the price compensate for the pulling of the price
caused by selloffs through mining. The truth is miners are purchasing new
coins from nobody, not affecting supply/demand directly and securing the
network through it. It's a very good choice for Bitcoin. So good that you'd
almost like to make a coin stable versus hashing power.
And what's worse: this does not depend upon any one transaction at all.
And what's better: this means that by your account the Bitcoin transaction
price is expected to regularly drop *dramatically*!
I think you should add the cost of developing software for Bitcoin, if you
take initial coin distribution into account. And to think that the price
ends up being similar to a bank transfer!

But, let's go with the flow of the article. Rants won't really settle
Two example usages are given.
The first is client-side hashing of a password, so that it's never sent in
the clear. This is so legitimate it nearly makes me drop my hat, but, the
author decides to use HMAC-SHA1 instead of SHA2 for reasons that are fully
beyond me. Perhaps just trying to make things less secure?
The second is using AES keys to client side encrypt. The author must've
thought he was being helpful when he imagined the scheme for this. Or maybe
he was drunk. "So you generate an AES key for each note, send it to the
user's browser to store locally, forget the key, and let the user wrap and
unwrap their data.". Somehow trusting the transport layer is all back in
vogue. The only key-generation problem in JS is entropy, which is a problem
everywhere tbh. If you really want to ensure entropy, send a random data
blob and XOR it with whatever client-side best-shot at randomness.
The author bluntheadedly claims "They will both fail to secure users". In
principle I agree, his methods sucked balls. He, however, blames it on JS.
Okay.. Let's go on.
REALLY? WHY?
Until those problems are fixed, Javascript isn't a serious crypto research
(points numbered for pointwise addressing)
1 - Yeah. Duh. What do you think of delivering anything client side?
There's the whole SSL infrastructure, if that doesn't cut it for you, well,
welcome to the Internet. (I suggest the next article is about how the
Internet is fundamentally flawed.) I would suggest, however, that once your
delivery pathway is exploited you're fundamentally screwed in every way.
You can't communicate anything, you can't authenticate anyone, you really
can't *do* anything! So let's leave out the "Javascript" part of this
point, and just do whatever we're already doing to alleviate this issue.
2 - This is a conclusion without any basis so far (aside from being..
meaningless to a computer scientist. Hostile?)
3 - Then just look at what data was transferred. Does every crypto
application require checkable source? Is any SSL implementation "considered
harmful" because nobody is able to flawlessly read the code, no compilers
are trusted, etc?
Okay so that chapter meant absolutely nothing. The author goes on to try to
defend his brabble:
"WHAT'S THE "CHICKEN-EGG PROBLEM" WITH DELIVERING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTOGRAPHY?
If you don't trust the network to deliver a password, or, worse, don't
trust the server not to keep user secrets, you can't trust them to deliver
security code. The same attacker who was sniffing passwords or reading
diaries before you introduce crypto is simply hijacking crypto code after
you do."
A fair point against a single thread model. Interestingly the last line
does absolutely not have to hold, sniffing (after the fact) and on-the-fly
rewriting are worlds apart. Take Tempest of Xkeyscore, for example, they
can't do rewrites. They need specialized programs for that. (Conclusion:
nope, nothing to see here)
The next chapter tries to justify the fallacies made earlier on. Equating a
rewrite to a read, ad-homineming the JS crypto "industry" (and failing to
distinguish operational security from actual security), and lastly claiming
that misplaced trust is bad (which is obvious and unrelated).
The next chapter claims SSL is safe, and "real" crypto unlike JS crypto.
Then firmly cements his baseless ridicule by claiming that if you use
non-JS crypto to make JS crypto work, then obviously there's no point.
The next chapter "WHAT'S HARD ABOUT DEPLOYING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTO CODE OVER
SSL/TLS?" claims all the page has to be SSL/TLS and that makes it hard.
It's not hard and you should already be doing it to have /*any*/ security.
Not to mention it's not true, only that interpreted as page contents has to
be SSL'ed (eg, images don't need to be transported over SSL).
So, point 1 has no merit against JS whatsoever. There's also a lot of
FUD-like text that denies reality. Especially the assumption that SSL and
desktop programs are somehow more secure.
So point 2.

"HOW ARE BROWSERS HOSTILE TO CRYPTOGRAPHY?

So far these people have been very reliable for me.
But, more seriously, nobody thinks SSL is a reasonable way to secure the
web. It's just the best people could think off.
Oh, and all the "people in charge" are in favor or not against it.
It does work against a /lot/ of threats. It's a pretty big deal when people
find a MITM that a  root cert helped with. Because releatively few people
can exploit a root cert (socially, politically, financially or just the
usual computer hacking way) it still helps (a lot) to have SSL. It also
means any attack that does work gets a lot more attention (is a lot more
high profile).
But, ultimately, a much better way is still unfound or unproduced.

tl;dr: I think it's a good idea, but it is offensive in a vague way.
It's really unfun to suddenly see binary in your JSON file. Both for
automated software that parses HTML (or something) and for people that use
text editors. The motivation for JSON isn't that it's easy and not too
inefficient. It's cleaner and more generic than XML. It's also faster to
write because the { and } are always written in code (you find them more
easily). It's just XML but a bit better.
If you want efficiency you could take to templated binary blobs. It
wouldn't actually be that hard, either, once we have some tools to do it.
You could even have a dual request, where you request "file.binary" and
"filelayout.json", where a JSON file describes the shape of the binary
information file.
It is actually a good idea. Definitely better than any alternatives (all
none of them). Just need plugins for text editors to hide the binary when
you're viewing it. And find some way to prevent binary overflow. You know
how C coders love to believe a length field, then do something bad and
everything goes poof. Maybe port over how attachments work in e-mail.
Actually, please don't it's awful. But it shows the sort of trouble you get.
It's great for some applications. I don't like that it would be good for
the wrong applications too. I also think we should harness more off the
power we already have, instead of thinking of new ways that are
I think I'd rather have a way to put JSON in front of my binary file, than
a way to put binary into my JSON file. It'd be great for metadata for
images, actually I've seen XML in front of PNG's and GIFS. We could use a
.BJSN, a format for a (JSON, Binary) tuple.
References may be better than embedding; flexibility in delivery and
storage, respects both formats more, keeps JSON simpler. That's the only
really valid concern I can come up with.
It depends on the application field. As a webdeveloper I can see the
utility and also the difficulty of good support. I think of previous
trouble with binary overflow, and how it can get really really messy. I'm
pro-possibility though! We should be able to do it, and leave it wherever
we think that's bad.
Maybe we should start calling it "JSON Transfer Protocol", though!

Yes, it needs crypto. I said verifably because "proving" an untamperable
hardware box (IOW: you can only plug it in, nothing else) is what the spec
says it is, is, well, impossible.
You'll depend on some observers, audits and where possibly physical
impossibilities, to show that indeed it is what it is. It's not proof, but
with trust you can verify it.
It's as good as it gets, but no better. I don't think that'd surprise
Part of the design involves generations. Eventually you'll have a
generation for which something is questionable in a certain way, nothing to
do about it. Generations will slowly die as the hardware breaks and the
network becomes too small (has too few resources) to uphold anonymity and
fault-tolerance guarantees.
Perhaps a generation will be hybrid with blackbloxes mailed to people and
satellites in space. That generation would be expected to deteriorate fast
in the first 100 years, and then hardly deteriorate at all for many after
All these different grids will have some sort of resource pricing scheme,
that may guarantee a certain runtime, or may be subject to monthly renewals
at new market prices or whatnot. It's a very interesting part of the design.
But yes, the anonymity profits /greatly/ from crypto. Interestingly I think
it could well work without crypto, whereas hardly any other designs could.
It'd lose a lot of convenience though! And P = NP doesn't mean crypto is
useless, just less nice. At the very least there'll be OTPs! Then there may
be (quantum) couple RNGs that can generate secure OTPs. I think there'll
always be ways the newer generations of this idea can continue to function.
It's progress, because now all we need is to specify safely, or find a way
to prove specifications. The rest is somewhat, maybe, experimentally
operational. It'll depend on how well we use it, but it is a step in the
right direction!

I have a rough outline for a "cloud computing grid" that verifiably:
* Exists on many hardware nodes that can be run by untrusted third parties,
as the hardware is "tamper evident" and the "cloud computing grid" is self
healing and distributing.
* Can run programs in a way that geographic location is unknowable - Onion
routing, amongst other features, causes programs to seemingly run on every
node in the network
* Cannot inspect what runs on it - the microkernel programs cannot read
what the programs are doing, nor can programs contact one another unless
they are instances (that potentially run on another hardware node).
* Is fault tolerant, automatically scaling, etc.
* Can still be addressed from the Internet or other networks
You could run something like your Bitcoin wallet in it. It's really
geodistributed, automatically fault tolerant, etc. There's no way to tamper
with the programs running, except as specified before a cluster was created.
Right now you're always stuck with an insane amount of local law, hardware
issues (and features), fault tolerance, accessibility, etc.
With this you could run a program in a nigh-perfect vacuum. Your program
would be networked, but not in any specific place. Nobody can know what it
does, but it can compute and it can communicate as it wishes. Depending on
the grid (grids have to be manifactured in one go, checked by several third
parties, distributed, set and forget) there's some pricing scheme or

I suggested one of the Bitcoin ATM guys to use two boards. One board is
connected like normally to networks and accessories and the like. That one
board also has a custom connection to the other board. The other board
contains all the secrets and performs all the important functions. The one
board just communicates.
The advantage is that once the big bad guys crack your baseband, your
chipset, your system on a chip's trapcards, etc. your secrets are still
safe. If you sign all the packets that pass through the communication board
you can truly abstract away from almost every possible hack that both the
boards could be vulnerable for. (Do you trust your silicon?)

Know what you code, and what you run. Don't be fooled by words and shapes,
code does what code does, that is all.
We seriously need a way to detach code from mental models to expose hidden
features. Basically, all computer law is rubbish because everything you run
on your computer, exploits and all, is something you run by choice. But
there's no way you could validate the sheer bulk of code. If you want to
really solve security flaws it'll involve somehow validating the
possibilities of the code run.
It's a discipline that touches on visualization, automated testing and
simplification. Simplification meaning, reducing possible states and
"execution paths". And just making code easier to comprehend.
The problem is that there's either no market for "truly secure" computing,
or there's just nobody filling the gap. Banks with their Cobol are laughed
at, mostly, and accused of lacking innovation. They do lack innovation in
the technical field. And Cobol is definitely not an ideal language. But
"truly secure" is worth a lot to them. L4 validated is a step in the right
direction, but catches a lot of wind saying it's still imperfect and
therefore worthless.
I'm utterly bored by code review. Maybe it'd be better if there were some
nicer tools to help out. I'm really sure someone has great recommendations
regarding this. (That don't even require Cobol :)

They send a Coast Guard Cutter and a squad of marines to escort you back
home forcefully. Or just leave you, without giving a damn. They couldn't
declare war without first declaring you a nation, which they won't, because
internationallylegally you aren't.
Unfair doesn't factor into it, if you ask me. Being a gentleman... well..
You'll probably be the offender in their eyes.
The thing is, violence is difficult. You're not allowed to harm a foreign
national (I'd be Dutch, you'd be whatever you'd be) for no reason
whatsoever. So maybe the coast guard will trick you into doing something
wrong, like shooting them first. There's no territorial waters when you're
not a nation, so they'll be allowed to ship right in.
But either they don't have a reason to care (and why would you do it?) or
they cannot do something (which is highly circumstantial) or you're just
not their match and lose. You'd say there's a chance you'd win, but there
probably isn't without being huge (Cuba is big enough though).
Somehow many nations still have never admitted to recognize Taiwan as an
independent nation, nor recognized it to be part of China. Taiwan still
claims to be the original and legitimate China, but sits on it's own seat

at some point they were clearing it with a helicopter, but they had AA guns
on the platform (wtf?!), so the helicopter went away again and Britain
really isn't going to risk lives for winning Sealand back.

So, those nations are doing well? I'm not sure what this does for you.
Internally, the nations you mentioned give much less security, wealth,

have posed large national security risks time and time again, seemingly to
very little avail other than to remain isolated, poor and sad.
I really (really) think we have huge *huge* first world problems. But, I
don't think the mentioned nations are doing any better.
Will this independence be better? How, why? These aren't trivial questions.
I believe the right conclusion for the wrong reasons is still wrong.
Independence seems like the right conclusion, but you must know why.
Power of law is a security as much as it is a risk. Humans act strangely
around things such as "duty", "honor", "law", "allegiance", "right", etc.

Couple it to Bitcoin to allow for payment, use a Mastercoin-like setup to

Actually, if you put a hash in the Blockchain that's pretty great too.
The alternative is not having payment for it, or having a trusted party

For me the reason for a kernel is existing drivers and a proven

possible, change it around as much as you can, to remove potential
exploits. There's just too many exploits though :(... No way to protect
against an exploited PDF, unless you want to reformat the PDF's (maybe into
JPG?). You could theoretically do that on the fly with L4, but with
bare-metal you'd be hurting yourself a lot.
Which also brings us back to Eugen, Eugen, for what is USB flash Biosafety
4? What do you want to do with these drives? Just moving data in, without
moving data out? Or just preventing some magical build-into-the-chipset
exploits (like is possible with Firewire)?
All of those could be brought with an L4-running device with USB and
another protocol, allowing better connectivity, too. But depending on the
threat model, less might be enough (or more!).
I think an air-gap is supposed to be gapped both ways. one could create a
purpose-specific data format, that can be re-interpreted by the software
running on the L4 device. Then, when transferring a file, the L4 device
will read the stuff from the USB, reinterpret it to ensure correct
formatting, write it out to the other side in whatever way chosen.

The same applies to every other tech startup out there.
Note that "compliance" can be subtle. It can be a National Security Letter

exploit in a router. It can be an undercover agent that came upon good
knowledge of how to achieve a key position. Most likely a wealth of methods
is used simultaniously, none admitted and without mutual knowledge of

(never happened, won't happen without a good amount of Change) the loss of
liberty is a damage paid cheaply with children's lives.
That sounds harsh, but it isn't. Unless they're going to make believable
statistics about the amount of deaths there's no argument at all. A cheaper
seatbelt costs lives. Not putting lithium in the water costs lives.
Influenza, and a lack of smart and organized medical spending are the
scourge of humanity. The bureaucratic response to crisies, big and small,
costs lives. Actually, the car is probably the greatest affront to public
safety there ever was.
But they're not talking about the car, are they?

I think Bitcoin going big like this was inevitable and not actually a good
thing. The distribution of Bitcoin is horrible. Really, really, really
horrible. Its also what drives and makes inevitable the adoption of
Bitcoin: simply put, there is a marketing budget.
Sadly the alternatives lack adoptation and technical merit. Basically the
future of finance is less humane (Bitcoin is hard currency) and more unfair
(Bitcoin is unfairly distributed). It is also not, in practice,
distributed. There is far too few parties in control of the miners that
work on the blockchain, and there's no reason for that to change. Bitcoin
policy hell is also real, very little will ever be able to change in
Bitcoin world. If it does it will make business sense and not reduce "early
investor advantage".
I'd like to add that Bitcoin is not as interesting as advertised.
Blockchains are a clever hack to achieve global consensus, but in order to
achieve a security level that takes X currency units to reverse around X
currency units have to be burned. Burning currency is undesirable. Only
currency successfully burned by trusted/not-untrusted/uncollaborating
parties counts towards the security level.
 * Distribution is terrible, which causes unstoppable success
 * Is less humane and more capable, causing assorted dangers but also being
more pure (in a currency sense)
 * Can be substituted very easily by something else
I don't really mind Bitcoin becoming successful even though it's imperfect;
it's still an entirely higher/better league than banks. I do mind there
being no talk of why Bitcoin sucks. Because no matter how awesome it is, it
really does suck.

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Re=3A_Hackers_can=E2=80=99t_solve_Surveillance?= 
The fun began with the implication that healthcare for everyone is a must.
Good healthcare means not dying in good health. Assuming mental health (too
tricky to deal with for this argument) that leaves people that wish to die
in a precarious position. And what do with so many people?
That might seem a strange argument, but it is not at all. Healthcare is yet
imperfect because it's damn hard and expensive. Less surveillance is
easier, not harder.
The problem is that the general public WANTS surveillance. They want to
give away their liberties for the safety it may bring them. Marx had a huge
audience. I do not believe the hackers do.
"Solving" surveilance for me means aligning it with justice, dignity,
freedom and most significantly, tirrany prevention. With the cost of
surveilance only going down we must consider the endgame. The endgame is
full and continuous surveillance. It is inevitable as long as more
surveillance has any advantage. I am not yet sure how to deal with this
properly, and think it a political question.
As for claiming your own privacy: we're far behind in the game for reasons
beyond me. Most likely some modern variant of imperialism, where money is
stolen from the weak and thrown at surveillance (see also the American
budget for the department of unconsitutionality).
To compare these issues with healthcare is meaningless. Although the
conclusion is correct. If there is not far more effort (=money) expanded on
feature-and-convenience parity for privacy-protecting solutions; we're all
royally fucked.
And no violent revolution will beat back the drone armies that already in
flight. The time that a revolution was feasible was already ending when the
founding fathers decreed Americans must bear arms in militias. Without
similar class weaponry there is no chance, regardless of combatant
quantity. The assault rifle cannot match the helicopter, the APC, the
drone, and is not readily available either. The people's organization
(intelligence and command and control infrastructure) will never again
match that of the army. There will be no more violent revolutions. That is
over now.
So, if everyone would be so kind as to think of what to do about a world
steepled in dysfunctional markets ... Well that would probably solve the
privacy thing as well. We'd know to buy safe. And we'd spend a lot more on
healthcare, too, I'm sure. But perhaps before everyone lived indefinitelt,
we should fix democracy, or adopt whatever *cracy does work. Although,
who's first to shoot me when I suggest no person knows what's best even for
himself, or should be left the freedom to make the wrong choice? Besides,
isn't government merely a product on a less free market?

Totally untrue. If any of the websites has failed to do proper password
hashing (or you password is intercepted due to keylogging, bad HTTPS, bad
remote host, etc) then the security of all your passwords will be VERY low,
depending on the length of the site's name. This is because the beginning
of the password is constant, and the latter part is a (partially
discovered) substitution.
Still, for "ye olde user" this isn't that bad. Could easily be improved
with some sort of substitution-ring-scheme, where you have various

Shouldn't be much more expensive, but could be a bit bulkier (or less

This is what I'm most concerned about! I think the Intel platform is too
big to not be exploited (more or less) on the hardware level. I have a very
little better feeling about AMD but I don't think it's based on much.
The idea that ARM processors are much much smaller and therefore easier to
audit makes them less attractive exploit targets. That, and that they've
only recently come into use, are build by smaller companies, etc. When you
build a SOC around it, well, that's kind of asking for trouble!
The best avoidance method I've come up with so far is taking two units,
(bitbanging) I2C (or whatever) over the IO pins to do "networking" from one
to the other, connect one to the Internet and the other exclusively over
those IO pins. That way, whatever exploit is present is VERY unlikely to be
triggered. It's... still not 100% of course.. If the exploit is on the
relevant IO pins, well, it just might be trigger-able by manipulating the
network traffic. Maybe write high every so many bits just to meddle? It's
closer then anything else, anyway.

Many people utilize faith for productivity or resolution to the existential

thinking, max(independence + transparancy), productivity (meaning,
advancement of the race or a derivative race/structure) and satisfaction.
Some understanding of the implications of evolutionary effects (selection,
and how it reflects on the currently existing), mathematics, and the nature
of energy and the universe (including entropy) must be included for a
complete and worthwhile picture. Spirituality must be explained as a
function of the brain, mythical events through statistics and human
capacity ("No gods but man").

The how is slightly easier to answer, it is just a how-to-get-there. The
where to go is the real issue.
Is this the problem? Human collective madness seems to have fostered first
kings and such royalty, whom then managed things as they did. Now we live
in a more Roman-like empire, where populism rules because the crowd does. I
suspect intentional market-expansion tactics found a happy marriage with
"American Imperialism" in providing a certain brand of democracy around the
world. It's not even obvious if that's good or bad. It sure has a certain
efficiency to it. And with the expert management of the superwealthy we're
practically guaranteed of capitalistic democracy's success.
I simply do not know what's best. So I tried to avoid the discussion for
the nonce. I am certain that a world in which people's lives are
continuously on the line is not one I'd like to live in. Less violence is
more efficient, too, as less is materially lost in conflict. The police are
not brainy philosophy types, so long as they do what they're supposed to
(represent the law, that is) you should not blame them at all. Better to be
systematic about solving issues.
Petty crime and petty policing is a mayor grievance. Why have the petty
laws? If it's hidden taxation, maybe it's just better that way. Why else is
it done? Don't hate the player, hate the game. Current politics puts the
masses in charge. They chose them that chose these laws.
There is. The answer changes depending on what you care about, but there is.
The democracy discussion is an exceedingly uncomfortable one. The largest
problem is pragmatism. Reality is cruel, yet I'd like not to be. A simple
example is having longer or shorter working days. Longer working days
(might, it's just an example) make a more productive society, yet it is not
something I'd necessarily want.
Reality is also intricate in it's interconnections, and amazing in it's
diversity. It is exceedingly hard to talk about. I suspect we'll continue
muddling in murky waters until we find a way to collaboratively apply
something like First Order Formal Logic. A sort of Wikipedia, but it would
be an encyclopedia of arguments. Enter your axiom's and get your logical
conclusions. Unfortunately, ArgueOnlineTM is a project I'd rather watch
than start.
Seems much like I just need to troll harder... I don't see much in terms of
discussion solutions at all.
I've been thinking frequently about map-reduce politics. I feel like a lot
of trouble comes from a lack of involvement in politics, partly due to
corruption and whatnot making involvement mostly a pesky annoyance. And
partly because people don't know how to be involved, can't be bothered to
spend the time to learn, and well, because it doesn't matter anyway.
Individual opinions are irrelevant, unless you're elected, in which case it
matters quite much quite suddenly.
So, what we do:
Starting with a population we convene in groups of 20. These groups elect a
single person to represent them (not to rule them, but to represent). They
can do so with a 16/20 agreement, if they fail to achieve that agreement
they will not be represented. The grouping method should be geographic by
default, but allow people to form groups at will. A variation with
randomized groups provides weaker convergence as geography correlates with
cultural norms, and does not provide greater safety per se.
This first level electorate (1 person out of every 20) will also form into
groups of 20, and again elect a single person. This causes a tree like
structure, leading up to a top level of less than 20 people which will not
select an elected (there is no president of the world).
It scales decently
^1 20 (very small school class)
^2 400 (a moderate/small school)
^3 8,000
^4 160,000 (two very large football stadiums (like Real Madrid's)
^5 3,200,000 (~population of Kuwait/Uruguay/Lithuania)
^6 64,000,000 (~population of the UK/Thailand)
^7 1,280,000,000 (~population of India/China)
^8 25,600,000,000 (about 4 times humanity, top council will be 6 people)
(group size rationale, skip if you don't care) I chose 20 because larger
groups are favorable, to cause lower levels to have a higher degree of
professionalism. Additionally 20 * 7 (=140) is still an almost
first-name-possible group size. I also think 8 layers seems like a good
quantity. Reducing the group size to 10 causes there to be 10 levels, with
the highest being 7/10 filled. There's some chance there'll exist an 11th
level in the not-too-distant future, the 20 groupings are expected to be
stable even with "optimistic" population growth estimates. Importantly, I
think 20 provides a good balance of being able to get to know people, yet
not uncomfortably personally. Culture and other factors may make tweaking
of group sizes favorable. Especially in remote regions it may be
hardly/unfeasible to group into neat groups. This effect is noncritical.
Every level is allowed to make law for the levels below it. The extend of
permissible law is limited by higher level law.  In accordance with the
laws the levels may levy taxes and manage budgets. If law permits they may
contract natural/legal persons to perform tasks, even legal persons of
their own making.
Somewhat interesting to note is that this is not at all a peaceful setup.
Every representative will continue to fight for it's group's unfair
advantage. I would hope the highest level will create a legal person that
is exclusively granted military rights, with elaborate safeguards, so as to
enforce a demilitarized planet (let's at least get that out of the way as
best we can..). Similarly I imagine multiple levels of courts. I wish for
free migration, because we are all human and our place of birth was not a
choice, but who am I?
After all it will be an exceedingly fair struggle. A very pure form of
democracy, with exceptional clarity of authority and robustness in growth.

Cool! I like the cipher-cascade :)
Regarding the FS: if Keccak loses some entropy in it's hashing, the entropy
in the key used would slowly degrade. Certainly Keccak doesn't preserve all
entropy, but it probably doesn't leak it fast enough to matter. You could
probably add some new entropy from the random generators. To prevent
padding, you could replace, say, merely the last bit as Keccak doesn't
(seem to) lose a bit of entropy per cycle. Could someone more knowledgeable
comment on this issue? It's probably inconsequential so long as Keccak is
what it seems, but it's much weaker-looking than the cipher-cascade.
I'm also impressed by the idea of data diodes. At first I thought they were
in software, and already thought "what an effective way to limit risk!".
Write a "microservice" that fronts two other processes, with separated user
accounts, and allows only data in or data out. Formally prove the fronting
microservice (it's small enough) and any error in your own code becomes far
less harmful (side channels are still there; cache- ,DOS, timing-attacks,
etc). Doing it in hardware is even better. It's highly likely that it
works, and that's *very cool*.

I went on this trip to the South of South Korea. It was organized by some
enthusiasts/travelers that regularly organize stuff. I thought at first
they were a semi-company (unregistered doing travelling agency like
activities) that don't pay tax and make a little buck while travelling,
especially as they mentioned no insurance and also carried a brandname and
logo, and had very regular activities. Operating through meetup.com,
though, always skirts the fine line between professional and amateur.
Certainly, though, the notion that they might make a profit even with cheap
tours (hint: no taxes) or that acting like a company kind of makes you into
one, was certainly lost on them.
The trip I went on was half paid for by the Boseong government. Given that
county was far away from anything touristic and, well, there was probably
hardly anything there, I thought they were just getting some
try-out-and-spread-the-word tourists. This was definitely true, the housing
was brand new (and empty). They managed to herd us into a
"Boseong-Kazagstan sister city project" presentation televised in
Kazakhstan (note: countries can be cities).
During the main activity a photographer's event was coincidentally planned.
Naturally, I was very unhappy about all this. Confronting others I found
that none of the 80 other participants shared my feelings to any extend.
Notably, most considered that they should do something back for the Boseong
government, for having paid half their trip, and so this was all fine. They
also gave enormous leeway for the volunteers that happily organized this
tour, and simply didn't see the harm of being taken pictures of (for
whatever purpose). (I got a horde of childish remarks, apparently most 20
somethings abroad are still living their highschool dreams)
The age of privacy, and everything with it, including the freedom of
association and separation of public and private life, is ending. The
public is smiling merrily along the road. 1984 is coming, but the public is
not scared or suppressed. They are smiling happy people, obedient and
cheerful, and they take the best of care of their keepers.
This is neither a hyperbole, not that much of a doomsday scenario. It is
simply inevitable and true. The cost of surveillance is decreasing, the
abuse of surveillance is mild or absent - and has passed from the people's
minds. People are not concerned with the eventual consequences of tracking
all their activities, they are concerned with having more fun.

your lawyer costs more than the whole blockchain, including operational

fraction of the features at IMMENSELY OVERSIZED WTF prices - just the time
spent negotiating it is outrageously more expensive. We're nowhere near
unacceptable, and it doesn't seem we will ever be. It's something to think
about, and you'll have to use SPV/API's in many cases where there would be
some value to not having to use them. That's definitely not convenient, but
also not that big a deal.
Bitcoin is often misrepresented to be:
 * Private
 * Free
 * Promoting equality (it does the /exact/ opposite!)
 * Jesus

2015-07-02 18:38 GMT+09:00 rysiek :
Saying Gavin knows quite a lot about Bitcoin is not an argument of
authority. It doesn't make him right, but it does make him very likely to
be right. Certainly more likely than the heapings of shitty arguments,
especially those that are technically disconnected from what bitcoin is.
When you listen to the arguments about blocksize it usually goes something
 * Cheaper transactions
 * More truly Bitcoin transactions
 * Simplest way to scale
There's some derivative arguments regarding poor people's access to Bitcoin
and a herd of applications that just require cheap access to the
blockchain. I think the most noteworthy argument is:
 * Bitcoin becomes more competitive/attractive as a result of cheaper
 * We can already fit quite some txs
 * the blockchain will be less wieldable
 * the bandwidth required to keep up with the blockchain (regardless of
storage) will increase
 * we can scale externally
The derivative arguments here are also poor people's access to Bitcoin, wrt
bandwidth, but the argument holds up much worse as SPV would work just fine
over those rare very slow connections. Then there's a lot of downright
fearmongering like "only institutions will run full nodes". Economically
that's just not true, and technologically it's not important - crypto
features allow usability immediately (simplefied (commercial) APIs, "blind"
tx broadcasting), strong guarantees *very *quickly (SPV), and certainty and
independence if you'd like it (a pruning full node), and history novelty at
only minor hassle (less than a day's work). Even a 100 fold increase in
blocksize would not radically change this.
It's pretty annoying to have an even bigger blockchain, don't get me wrong
on that, but that's just the way Bitcoin works: a blockchain that grows
with use. There's no reason for it to truly upset you, either. Running a
full node is already something you don't do for no reason at all. I can't
really make this argument as well as I like. The point is that if you have
a reason you would still do it later, and if you don't you don't already.
Some people noted that the pruning makes it possible to run a full node on
their phones. Cool! But there's no reason to. In fact, you won't because
it'd drain your battery. We'll be okay without the one silly geek that does
it anyway.
So.. these points were already hard to argue against clearly. Then there's
"we can scale externally".... The trouble is that there's so many ways,
like pinning (sidechains/mastercoin), exclusively inter-institutional
settlement, debt based moneys ("the bearer of this token is entitled
to..."), and all of them could work! In fact, we could just abandon Bitcoin
alltogether! And that's the core of my counterargument: we don't have to
cripple Bitcoin, so let's not. Let's not make it more complicated than it
has to be. If we do scale externally, let it be for exceedingly good
reasons and at exceedingly competitive prices.
Mostly I see people haggling over nothing on Reddit, and even here. There's
also confusion about roles in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and about ideals. Then
there's confusion about consent, and how to manage it. It's probably
because all those things are badly fleshed out. Hard-to-achieve consensus
has advantages; Bitcoin will be technologically stable. The roles will
shift anyway. Ideals are not inherent, only cold hard currency is. It's
implications depend on culture and math, both generally not very well
understood. Reddit has never been conducive to quality argument - at
fantastic loss to everyone but the populists.
I think, ultimately, that giving Gavin ultimate authority for 10 years then
freezing the whole ordeal would probably work out rather well. I think it's
ran afoul of his control too soon. We already have some weird bugs in
Bitcoin. Then there's some strange (unstudied) economical effects like the
halving (and why not gradual decrease?). I'm sure lots of people found
similar oddities from their perspectives. There's just not much to do about
it anymore now.
The Chinese mining pools stamping their document regarding increasing the
blocksize to 8mb was extraordinary. They ignored Gavin's 20mb or anything
proposal ("or anything" probably mostly to make 20mb seem reasonable). They
stamped - a thing completely outdated in the West, yet common in Asia (and
pretty badass). They are a group of Chinese making law for everyone.
 Gavin appeased them and provided for
unattended growth with a period 8mb increase. Smart move.
So - conclusively - Gavin is a hero, the Internet's retarded, Bitcoin is in
policy jail but it likes it there. Oh, and the free-est market of the world
is already significantly run by Chinese. If you read this far, thanks.

There's absolutely no reason to think the NSA doesn't have a
layered/multi-cell operation wherein a mere contractor is not given access
to nation-essential secrets. If there's a foreign spy you want him to
penetrate what seems like a complete organisation. Why not give them what
they want? There's lots of "more secure than FBI/CIA, less secure than 'we
broke enigma' " work to be done, just put it in the public-facing
independently operating organisation.
Would you publish "we broke enigma" in a memo to the intranet? NSA didn't.
NSA wouldn't get worse at what they do.
The real headbreaker is when this is a problem. It's basically not a
problem until you're a threat to the absolute fundamentals of what the NSA
is designed to protect. And what's that? Is it personal freedom, the
advancement of the human race, and the minimization of suffering? Is it the
maximization of some abstract profit? The concentration of power? Do the
latter two pretty much amount to the first?
Intelligence laundering is a serious issue, of course, but running a clean
organization would make the laundering exceedingly hard.
They're each large organizations with no bottom line that attract people of
I'm in Korea, I talked to a bunch of US soldiers stationed here. They're
exceedingly good-hearted, well-intentioned, high-spirited guys. Many love
their work, the tension, the seriousness and hone their performance for
sport and need. The balance between trigger-happy and accident-adverse is
delicate and they seem extensively coached to preserve the balance properly.
I've talked to some that like their state, but hate the FED. I've talked to
some that think the US is bad but it's enemies are worse. I've talked to
some that have doubts about parts of the US, about corruption, but believe
in democracy such that they believe the US is a fundamental force of good.
The lesson is: very moral people still do very immoral things for many,
sometimes excellent, reasons.
I think there's not much difference between organisations. Make sure
people's motivations are sincere and that they put in the effort. There's
apparently a serious issue with "human resource rot" where worse people get
brought into orgs or people get unfocused or demotivated. Without a bottom
line there's less penalty for it. Doesn't mean it will happen. Snowden sure
shows a certain amount of rot in NSA_Public. The recent Trident leak shows
that the UK's nuclear deterrent program is rotten to a ridiculous point,
but seems to indicate the US does much better.

"All browsers suck"?.. They run HTML pretty darn well. I'd say HTML is a
document language, not an application language, and now it's trying to be
both and it's a pretty psychotic fit. But it still works pretty darn much
better than anything else out there. I'd like there to be an "all settled
standards compliant fast and secure browser", but the secure is usually
omitted (and there's a rush to support the not-quite-settled standards).
Not much wrong with JavaScript, but I hope they'll soon support several
other languages too. Like perhaps LLVM's intermediary format - so we can
compile whatever into a near-metal language that will run really fast. (and
saving a lot of people the effort of writing/maintaining to-js compilers)
But the cloud is a better computational platform because of:
 * Economies of scale for computer electronics, power, network connections
 * Time sharing on the cloud's hardware
 * Sometimes architecture advantages
But, pushing back, there's:
 * Latency/bandwidth to user
 * Loss of end user's control over essential hardware
 * Massive trust and security issues
We're looking at the following:
- micropower devices; IoT and thinner smartphones (less power usage as
batteries do not seem to develop fast), home automation panels, extra
body-mounted-displays, in-car panels, home-appliance panels (refrigerator
to mixer), televisions, alarm clocks, some tablets and laptops
anything with power or financial constraints. These machines are that which
the user interacts with. Their entire design gives way to human preference
and comfort. They do not compute much, and might contain nothing but a
video-stream-decoder and a "window manager" that decodes simple graphics
statements (hopefully simpler than HTML).
- computers; workstations, desktop pc's, laptops, stand-alone "videocards"
with generic computing support, servers, gaming-appliances
fast computers that are positioned somewhere in the house. Low latency to
the user and with very good price/performance relationships (desktops now
are miracles). Given the single-core-ceiling these machines will typically
fare better than ideal cloud setups for many applications. They can be
rented out to remote users dynamically.
- remote processing; the cloud, the neighbors' computers, etc
time-shared computing that is not in-house. Typically high latency,
extremely high maximum power and lowest cost. Latency constraints force it
to be used only for very expensive operations - such as rendering tasks and
machine learning (for business intelligence or otherwise). If the
set-up-time for such an operation is 2000ms many tasks are still better ran
locally - the application-support-system (OS?) will have to make choices
about this rather fast.
What I've described above is a sort of multi-tier architecture. At the
moment remote or local computing is a wild west with exclusively homebrewed
solutions. At some point we will integrate all our devices, and software's
locality will be managed better as well. Encryption will be applied
automatically at the appropriate places. I think the largest desired
capability is the inaptly named "homomorphic encryption", which should be
optimized and packaged such that heavy processing can be remotely executed
in a safe and trustless manner.
What is to be done? Well, I hope we can avoid the situation where we run
the browsers and they run the software. We're going there now because the
architecture I mentioned does not exist - and because it's a simpler model.
A business could be made out of making hardware that follows the above
model, that would probably be the best way to make it happen. Elsewise
we're all along for the ride that the unknowing public is buying us into.

Anyone care for a law that will:
1. Ban unhackable vehicles and other life-critical devices (meaning:
life-critical software must be rewritable)
2. Require all life-critical software to be released in source format, for
the purpose of public auditing, improving it's safety features and
employing the software on the devices it is intended for.
3. Any tools used to translate the source to writable code must also be
provided in the manner of 2.
These laws should still allow manufacturers to:
1. Spy on their users without that being changed
2. Lock down their code so competitors may not use it (proprietary open
3. Have software in the machines that is not opened; so long as it is
properly (verifiably) isolated from essential systems
4. Legally own the entire machine
5. Drop guarantees when non-security-related modifications have been made
This law should be as precise and immutable as possible. This is not a
matter of "I want to hack things" or "competition would be better if it
were open" or "I want to own what I have/use", etc, etc. Being precise with
the law allows it to pass more readily.
Personally I think if everything were required open source and
self-compiled; that would objectively be better for humanity as a whole.
For protecting innovation there's patents, closing the source is excess.
Etc. etc.
But this is not about fun. This is about extremely basic safety. It is
about national security; if 500,000 cars go haywire at the same time a lot
of deaths, directly and indirectly, can be expected. And it's not just the
cars; it's also the industrial machines, medical equipment, the metro's and
trains, the automated cars and busses and trucks and aircraft, medium sized
hobbyist drones, heaters, stoves and ovens, automated doors, elevators,
fire, smoke and other emergency alarms, etc.
Should a foreign country cyberattack whilst doing any other kind of large
scale attack; the effects could be devastating. Should a person be marked
for assassination, no one would be the wiser.
I'd argue for similar protection for fridges, televisions, smartphones,
etc, etc, as more and more items are expected to become networked and
essential for upholding basic freedoms and ways of life. And I'd argue to
have it for privacy; not just essential safety.
Simply put; the simple version of the law above is imperative for personal
and national security. And it doesn't exist.
(note: all countries should be more worried about cybersecurity. I cannot
trust my government to act as it should if every public servant can be

Money Laundering itself is of no harmful consequence. It's good for the

like the idea of people living off of money I earned. It only makes sense
because money is already an abstract and perverted item, and because basic
needs will soon drop much further in their cost. (Especially if cheap
living becomes a greater priority)

I think I'd feel a bit less anxious in general, knowing the worst that
could happen is living in good comfort. I think 30k per person is too much
though, 15k is really quite enough (at least in NL). This also to prevent
complete perversion of reward-for-labor.
I think the "digital nomad"-compatible family of jobs will lose their
associated risk (if it doesn't work out, you're still fine) and that will
help them. Jobs that are highly paid will likely still be pretty rewarding,
too. It's the jobs that pay little now that get the serious change in their
economics. Who wants to pick up garbage for almost no money, when you have
enough money?
It is also hard to estimate how many people will prefer entirely useless
work, or a minimal lifestyle. Given a tease more automation that should not
be a problem. But, remember, as automation increases the basic income can
become less; as a certain level of comfort is achieved at a lower price.
This also gives governments some new and interesting incentives.
The gamble sometimes seems to be whether some "successful creative and
risky business" produces more value than "cheap labor". (And, well, what
those lousy-job-people will do when they get a lot of time on their hands!)

Ah, but it is exactly why we must invade.
Tradition, lore, ethnicity, religion, these things fracture markets. A
homogeneous market is easier to sell to, easier to maintain. So too does
democracy create a neat field for the economic game.
It is too offensive to simply do away with these things. More tolerable is
creating meta-culture, culture that must be observed within other culture.
These meta cultures allow people to coexist in a way that's offensive to
everyone, but no so offensive as to cause people to go out-of-bounds.
We've gone and crushed their existing systems. We must now wait for chaos
to consume the resilient. At the same time we must prevent all roads to
order, except that road that leads to maximum economic exploitability; a
privatized free market in a tolerant elections based democratic government.
Aside from making the country impossible to steer, the representative
democratic system is also the most sensitive to (foreign) propaganda, and
still subject to every form of bribery and corruption. I struggle to
envision a system that's more readily exploited.
I do find it peculiar that these places do not readily organize into neat
democracies. I am not the expert of such matters, to me it mostly seems
that people do as they please. Perhaps the children will not struggle quite
so much. Certainly, until they give in, there will be no order. This can be
made sure of.
Ok, so, either the above, or, you know, these places were a mess before,
then NATO went in, and it was still a mess.

Can I get a fork with penis heads on the prongs? Or maybe just a single
fork like that in a set that's otherwise just like it?
In NL we've succeeded at eliminating most of this sort of culture. Girls
may wear their ridiculous hair-hiding self-incriminating headpieces, and
they often do. I just love it when they also do makeup; thick eyeshadow,
bronze powered cheeks, vibrant warm lipstick. When they finish up with
form-fitted T's or sweaters and nice leather boots, well, that's even
lovelier. And when you've gone that far, why not wear those gorgeous
form-giving 50% denim, 50% stretchyester pants. You know, the kind that has

Okay, so, satire aside, the author does not enter into specifics. Should
NATO have left the dictators, kings, etc to it? Should we have seen
overmuch of our wealth flow whence the oil comes? There's also throwing
around words like "war criminals" which is just propaganda, as the word is
unde(rde)fined. There's a good grasp of world-leader-geography, but little
of anything else. There's no real point made, except "it's a mess where
NATO went".
Ultimately, I think given the same axioms people should end up making the
same conclusions. It's pretty rare for people to unify their own arguments
correctly, so this is not always true. I can confidently say that men can
maintain a level of composure even when a woman uses a fork, and that most
religions keep out-of-date notions of cleanliness. (dear all, we can
reliably sterilize pork now. It's no worse than other foods.) (dear all, we
can reliably combat sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy without
abstaining. By now abstinence is causing far more harm than it is solving)
(dear all, besides alcohol, there's a range of safe-enough recreational

crime. Heavier punishment may be completely ineffective, depending on the
crime and its motivations.)

If you're panscient (know the current state of the world) you could
determine the actual risk precisely. Then you multiply value * risk, and
you know the likely debt, or debt equivalent. If the gamblers are even a
bit conservative (and correct) you will likely find the debt is negative -
these derivatives will probably be positive assets. Why else have them?
Nobody's panscient, but the people that make these bets try to be. They
stake their wealth on their correct guessing. I'd say that gives them the
right incentives.
It's also quite likely that bets are both ways (one person thinks x,
another thinks y), limited in their ability to lose money (stop loss
present), etc, etc. Simply counting them as debt is /wrong/.
The more competitive you need to be, the riskier your bets need to be. You
can abide with little risk, or fly high with intense gambles. Try not to
burn your wings.
This is not the right thing to do.
If you remove risk, the system will not be balanced. You will create a
system that is overly risk-seeking. If you remove the penalty for taking
huge huge gambles, why not stake it? Reduce the penalty for failed bets and
you (directly) increase the amount of failed bets.
Having this advantage only apply to large corps is an even greater
disturbance in the market. Why in gods name would you give big companies
incentive to fail? Larger risks, larger profits. Countries as a whole are
running on their economic hindlegs - running because they can no longer
seem to walk.

of national interests*. An evil system without evil actors. If we're going

It'd all be fun and games if it weren't my taxes that're being used against

* eg: we have national insurance for salaries, so they may be paid despite
bankruptcy. Employees do not suffer even though their labor was bad for
society (as determined by the markets). At least, we'd know if the markets
weren't already disturbed beyond realism. This leads to companies being
less risk adverse than they should be, which leads to a disturbed market in
which a legitimate, fair, balanced, honest company cannot operate
profitably. Everyone suffers.

US debt has no theoretical limit. Instead debt value is limited by the

The way the US rents the finances from the FED is confusing and I'm not
sure what it means for where the rent goes. Ideally, it just reduces the
amount of USD in circulation.
The US is not in the situation that it's rent outweighs it's income, and is
therefore not killed. Even if it does it mostly means the government and
people will have to adopt another currency that's not hyperinflating. Then
wait for the USD to devaluate the entire debt to a payable level. (Note:

Not true at all. Many people have trouble tracking long lines, partially
because eyes are jumpy (not scrolling). Some people have this very

This is also something testable. There's empirical research. According to
this "An empirical demonstration carried out by Morrison and Rayner (1981)
confirmed that saccade size is consistent in terms of number of characters,
and not visual angle"
meaning, you plop your eyes a certain amount of characters - not angle. You
read a certain amount of chars per peek, and variable width might confuse
you (maybe).
"If the lines are too short, readers cannot make use of much information in
each fixation. If line lengths are too long, the return sweeps to the
beginning of the next line are difficult."
Pretty straightforward/as expected
"(..) 2.2A + 21 ms (Carpenter 1977), which means that the greater number of
return sweeps with shorter lines will add more to the time than longer
Not sure about the unit of A (amplitude?) but it means you take 21 ms, plus
some measure of distance, to move your eyes from x to y.
The authors seem to be fans of the idea that reading speed simply improves
from longer lines, up to about 130 characters, after which the line becomes
unwieldy. Some in-print research showed 70 or 52 (?) characters to be the
ideal width. I find it amusing that these relate roughly to coders'
standards of 60, 80 or 120 characters.

Money is liquid value. Value is the game. It's not at all about money,
money is useless. It's the value it denotes that's what it's all about.
You seem to ignore how seriously amazing pure liquid value is. In an ideal
world; when faced with two choices, the most profitable one is the one
that's bottom line better for humanity. You make an egoistic choice, and
improve the world.
A more profitable solution is either more efficient or provides greater
value. Error is introduced in judgement of value, and unmarket effects can
distort the picture of efficiency.
Other unmarket effects include excessive wealth (where more or less wealth
simply doesn't matter), limited lifespans (who cares if you lose? You'll
die anyway), extreme fuzziness of value, etc, etc.
Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?

Pollution is a difficult subject. It is easily solved:
1. All the earth is vested into a legal person
2. The legal person will auction destroyable earth - licenses to dump
pollutants, manipulate land, cut rainforest, fish, hunt, etc. such that
auction profit is maximized - yet earth preserved as per politically
determined rules. (must support X panda's, Y biodiversity units, Z
radioactivity level, etc)
3. The auction's profits are diverted to causes of common interest (donated
to the world government)
3. ALTERNATIVELY The auctions profits are transferred into (a) fictive
good(s) and destroyed - causing inflation/deflation to distribute the
finances over the owners of the fictive good. The choice of fictive good is
as important as the choice of a cause of common interest - it is merely a
way to exclude government from the process. There is atm no suitable
fictive good.
There's some issues regarding compensation for those most affected.
Chernobyl's responsible legal people (Russian gov, whatever exploitation
company, etc) will be forced to buy the destroyable earth licenses, likely
causing a massive bump to the price. It would have been dearly paid for.
But it would make sense for people more affected by the nuclear fallout to
see a bigger cut of that value. It's complex and political but can be done

The "Wall St vultures" may be greedy assholes (idk) but the reason they're
effective is because our markets are not. The better our financial system
works, the less money people in the business could make. Perhaps now it
explains everything :P? (I think the obscurity, complexity, gravity of the
subject matter and legal restrictions caused by the aforementioned is why
the financial markets don't work better)
We're all in the same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.
Or not together, that's the problem. (Also, sometimes people don't care)
Sorry for being verbose. It's very hard to get these arguments across. I'm
quite sure we're all on the same side, it's just so damn hard to speak.

New threat, this is offtopic.
So I think people took my meaning wrong. I meant to say "don't hate people
for behaving as the system rewards them to do", and then to ask "what kind
of system would make people behave as you like?".

I feel like you are ignoring the cost of time, underestimating people's
expenses, and arbitrarily hate cars and meat.
For most "the latest iCrap" is not a significant expense. 200 euro's a
month or so (phone + laptop) is quite doable, especially given how much
time one spends with iCrap devices. Resale value is nonzero, too, so
really, quite doable.
I know how to fix/repurpose most things. Actually fixing things often
doesn't compare favorably with just buying a new one - time spent at 10
euro's per hour makes most repairs very borderline effective.
Trade what? I do secondhand shopping and selling when appropriate, that
should be good too.
Do, for the things it makes sense for. It takes more effort as you
frequently will not find what you were looking for. (protip: great for
amplifiers and speakers)
Fair trade/wages are determined by the capitalist market, not by me. I'm
simply not that arrogant. If you don't believe in markts you have more work
cut out for you than just buying fair trade branded products. (Protip:
fairtrade is just another way for things to be shiny)
Buying local is even more meaningless. If transport costs do not outweigh
production costs, go ferry it in from Australia, China, Chile, etc. You're
making the efficient choice by doing so.
- Use a bike or public transit whenever possible.  Get rid of your car and
Public transport or Zip Carring add to stress, cost more time, are not
reliable and are not portable storage. I'd like an electric car, but the
initial purchase is so high it skews things like tax and insurance.
Idk why you hate cars so much. They're pretty damn useful, give you lots of
freedom and independence, and just help you get around so much better than
public transport. Their prices also compare with other forms of transport.
(bikes are slow and only really work in villages or compatible cities)
Preparing my own food is a waste of time, other people are cheaper, mass
production is cheaper, I'm very mediocre at cooking.
Going vegan is an interesting choice, all evidence points to it being much
much much better for the environment, etc. but meat is still quite
affordable and quite complimentary to meals. If it truly were 100x easier
on the environment I'd expect to see that in the price, and I hardly do. I
assume there's some sort of sponsoring going on, and until it stops I'll
keep on eating delicious and healthy meat.
(Hey, you asked for suggestions: these are mine.)
Thanks for playing :)
Razer mentioned a TV, I don't own one. I have a sizeable monitor. Much
prettier than most TVs. I might get a projector someday, it's fun to watch
movies together like that.
Razer also fuzzes about collectivism vs individualism. They used to have
collectivism in many nations. They all lost. I think a society design that
involves individual incentives (the best of capitalism; advanced finance,
legal persons, markets, competition), global optimization (the best of
communism; managed competition, fine tuned production, >designed markets<),
and collective ambition (the best of government/academia; being able to
strife together and make deep, long term investments) would be ideal.

I'm sorry, but there's only so much one will do with disregard of self.
I feel like this discussion has starved. There's a distinct lack of depth
and logic, and now the meaningless arguments are drying. There has been
naught in the way of designer societies, let alone the code we can write to
help get there. Mostly it's the powerless contemplating how fair it would
be if they weren't.

The idea that you can force people to act in the common interest has been
tried many times. We prefer to have freedom, nowadays. At least, I do.
Game theory puts wrenches in any collaborative action that's not entirely
individual centered. Go let the pigs ravage you, I'll just wait to discuss
an arrangement with them once they're through with you. I just hope you
didn't give them absolutely unmatchable unfair advantages. (footnote: did
you ever see a B-52 bomber in real life?)

Hence I am upset with it.
What, because law is made by criminals, for criminals? idk why you don't
like law. I guess you'd rather grab a horse, a sack, and a rope, and call
that justice.
Ethical considerations like animal rights should not encode into strict
law. Same goes for drugs, sexuality, etc. Because these things are
difficult and I am not going to hurt people (punish them) for something
that might be fine, depending on how you look at it.
You know, when I answer with a joke it's probably because I couldn't bother
to bridge to your level of stupidity. Sorry for letting that out, but
compare the Wild West to the Roman Empire, compare African tribes to old
Japan. Structured violence can decrease overall violence.

I explained in detail why this is. If you didn't get the "costs of
enforcement" argument you're allowed to admit it. Hell, you might try
providing any argument yourself instead of responding to mine.
(to recap: if it costs 100 bucks to enforce a contract, the contract will
not at all protect any damage below 100 bucks. Without governance the cost
of strict enforcement is huge. You may also be in no position at all to
enforce a contract, like when your adversary is more powerful than you)
You're like a redneck piece of shit or something. To call CERN scammers ...
you must be seriously troubled.
And, actually, yeah, I think humanity is pretty much nothing but little pet
projects. I think bigger and cooler pet projects are practically all we can
hope for.

instantiated as "some organization that can generate 'appropriate'
political decisions", where I marked "appropriate" such that you might
understand it is an undefined variable, that I cannot fill in just like
It's not the first time you've failed to grasp my meaning, and responded
unkindly to the shadows you drew instead.
        "Freedom is not very strongly defined anyway"
Nah, I'm fundamental. If you think the word freedom has a good exact
meaning, well, fuck you for keeping it to yourself.
Continuing in the same vein as the CERN comment. Sad.
Well, at least I don't think I'm the source and means of justice.
Like, I dunno Juan, I'm really trying here. I thought you were about to
start explaining what you think, but here you are, spewing meaningless
offense again.
I mean, I learned some formal logic, you'd say that's a superset of basic
logic. UKGOV (through cie ) even certified me for
critical thinking which, I think, involved some logic. I mean I got a
pretty bad grade, but I think it is because I merely skimmed the book the
day before the exam and dedicated my essay to shitting on the BBC and how
they're pressured for time in a world with bad journalism and lack specific
expertise to discuss complex topics, but whatever.
Doctors say no, Juan says yes, the mystery continues...
Did you ever go for a mental checkup? Or did you prefer the criminals keep
their scary tentacles away from you?

The way Hillary handled the North/South Korea issues during her term as Sec
of State was simply horrid, leading to the greatest tension in a very very
long time. Basically, showing the US' teeth to a cat in a corner. Just to
see if it really won't back down. It was a moronic policy, and could well
have led to casualties. If she wins and attempts to cause stuff like that
she just might succeed.

We do make sport of improvement plans for the global situation. I feel we
do pretty well, probably on account of tossing history and a lot of feeling
out of the window. More importantly, we ignore the difficulty of reaching
the envisioned state. It is interesting, and could well improve our ideas
of how things should be.
Reg. US/EU vs CN/RU, CN will overtake economic and thus military capacities
well within 20 years. From that moment onward we are subject to Chinese
politics. My guess is they will start with harassment of neighbouring
countries, and just move on from there. Likely eventually
forcing/negotiating a surrender, rather than WW3, on account of our
pacifist intents.
ATM we would win. Perhaps the idiotic US candidates are put forth to
provoke war on our terms. A war we would win - with large casualties. A war
we should fight if we like democracy and individualistic financial economy,
and that form of "do whatever you want" that we have. That is, if you
believe China would actually end up fighting, rather than becoming as
pacifist as the west. If you have ever spoken to Chinese, you will know the
latter to be less likely than the former. Of course, the world is banking
on peace - given we are allowing China to advance.
I do hope that China intentionally turns itself pacifist. It would save a
lot of lives, money and time. It's borders are large enough, most would
say. I cannot pretend to know "what China wants", so I cannot really say
how it will behave. My talks with Chinese have shown a pride in their
ignorance of politics. And a government in exclusively self-checked control.
As a side note: I would propose we split the world into countries of equal
population, introducing a GDP based tax to (softly) ease imbalance between
these new nations. It only requires a bye-bye to nationalism. The size of
each nation should be chosen based on evidence of that size being effective
- which sizes of government perform better. The internal structure of a
nation is quite moot. Whatever works. War would be illegal. Natural
resources and permissible pollution should be auctioned on a global market.
We can have a shared (UN?) court for determining things like permissible
pollution and settling lawsuits that are carried all the way up. For
settling disputes between nations, and their adherence to global law.
I'd like to see "timeliness of justice" to exist. I'd like to see the US'
pieces remove it's landmines, and stop it's hollow points etc, and stop
killing it's citizens without due process, and for Israel not to drop white
phosphorous into civil areas, and for Russia not to annex nations, and for
China to stop polluting the planet to beyond critical, for European nations
to make good on their human rights promises regarding immigrants, for
someone, anyone really, to stop ISIS' obvious human rights offenses, etc,
etc, etc.
It should be politics like we're used to. Only we've levelled the players'
fields to make the game better. And stand a chance at forcing good
So, can we achieve this system? Of course not. But would it work? Well, not
trivially, but yes, it would be better than the Pax Americana. Or, I guess,
the peace of those that actually "run" the US. (probably some
association(s?) of people with outrageous capital looking to expand their
circle of capitalism/power to the rest of the world?)
Reg. brainwashing and individual power, I know you want brainwashing to be
responsible, but most likely the brainwashing is generally improving the
situation. People are the problem, not all, but many, and the brainwashing,
through religion, television, smart filtering, is primarily making them
behave in a way that is generally civilised and cooperative. I don't know
what else it does, of course, but without the brainwash people are probably
less nice, not more nice, and individual control is just awful. If only
because less disparity means less friction means less trouble. If you want
to see what anarchy does, basically Detroit. As soon as things start
looking better, it starts looking more like government.
