@_subject: [gentoo-embedded] Hello 
Hello everyone. I'm new to the list (obviously).  Just a note to say hello.  I've been speaking with 'solar' on IRC today and he has been helping me get setup.  I'm working primarily with the soekris although I also muck around with OpenWRT on the Linksys/Crisco wrt units. I hope I can be of some help, anyways looks like a great effort and I look forward to witnessing this all progress. Cheers, James James Couzens,
