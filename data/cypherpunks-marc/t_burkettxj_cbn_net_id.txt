I sent you an email a few days ago because you now qualify for a new mortgage.
You could get a $300,000 for as little as $700 a month!
credit is no problem, you can pull cash out or refinance.

No thanks
The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that 243 counties -- mostly in the eastern third of the country -- will probably be found in violation of the federal air standard for soot.
State officials will have to develop plans aimed at cutting the pollution by 2010 or 2015, depending on the severity of the air quality problem, or face sanctions, including possible loss of highway funds.Reducing microscopic soot, EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt told reporters, is "the single most important action we can take to make our air healthier."But getting those reductions has been far from easy.The EPA issued a new air quality standard for "fine particulates" -- particles less than one-seventh as wide as a human hair -- in 1997, only to have it challenged by industry. The legal fight went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and eventually the EPA prevailed.
