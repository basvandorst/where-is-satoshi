Attn: Dear,
I am Dr. Henry Seely, before anything i ask if you can be trusted, because one of my late friend deposited the sum of US$3,000,000.00 in a Bank here in Abidjan Cote D Ivoire, and i went to the Bank in order to be sure if the said fund is still with the Bank, and the Bank here in Abidjan has assured me not to be worried about anything that all i needed is to forward to them my full banking information where the said fund will be transferred to, and i told them that my Late friend did a contract in your country with you, that before his death, he wrote a well that the sum of US$3,000,000.00 should be transferred into your account.
Furthermore, all i needed from you is truth and honesty, because i dont want any delay in this transaction, so as soon as you read my mail do not fail to reply me with your direct telephone and fax number together with your full banking information so it will enable me to forward it to the Bank for them to notify you for onward transfer of the fund, for your information, the sum of 30% will be for you, why the balance 70% will be for me after the transferring of the fund to your nominated Bank account.
Finally, i will be looking forward to read from you, and if you need to discuss with me on phone all you needed is to contact with me directly with the number that is stated herein 00225 08 188 984, for further details.
Thanks and God bless.
Yours Henry Seely.
