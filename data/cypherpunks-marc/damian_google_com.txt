Thanks for clarifying.
We're off-topic, but that decision needs to be weighed against the
alternatives.  If your alternative is running your own mailserver at home,
then your risks are:
  - They can come into your home and walk off with your machines.  Even if
your hard drives are encrypted, your backups might not be... or maybe you
don't have backups?
  - If you browse from the server they can get you with a trojan impacting
Flash or Java.
  - Even if you don't browse from your mailserver they can try to
compromise it remotely if it's not fully patched.  How good are you at
keeping your system patched.  Does it fall a day or two behind when you're
on vacation?
  - Speaking of vacation, how do you authenticate to your system?  Does it
support 2-factor?  Or maybe you don't think you need 2-factor because you
have an SSL cert.  Did you self-sign it and tell your browser to ignore all
other CAs (to approximate Chrome's certificate pinning)?
  - How does your email arrive/leave?  They could be tapping your line...
or they could just DoS you off the net.
If you really think you can get all of that right, all the time, then I
wish you the best of luck.  But remembering that most targets are not
cypherpunks, telling them to do it themselves is incredibly bad advice.
Back on topic: encryption without knowing who you're talking to is worse
than useless (hence no self-signed certs which provide a false sense of
security), and there are usability difficulties with exposing strong
security to the average user (asking users to generate and upload a
self-signed cert would be a customer-support disaster, not to mention all
the outages that would occur when those certs expired).  Real-world
security is all about finding a reasonable balance and adapting to the
current threats.

[Full disclosure: I work at Google, though the opinions stated below are
mine alone.]
Aurora compromised at least 20 other companies, failed at its assumed
objective of seeing user data, and Google was the only organization to
notice, let alone have the guts to expose the attack [0].  And you're going
to hold that against them?
If you're the target of a state-sponsored attacker, Google is by far the
best place to host your mail.  Good luck finding another provider that
enables SSL by default [1], offers 2-factor authentication [2], warns you
when you're being targeted by state-sponsored attackers [3], and actually
fights overly-broad subpoenas from governments [4].
While I'm writing, I'll also point out that the Diginotar hack which came
up in this discussion as an example of why CAs can't be trusted was
discovered due to a feature of Google's Chrome browser when a cert was
being used to spy on users in Iran [5].  Note that it also provides a good
example of the difficulty of getting away with such attacks.
