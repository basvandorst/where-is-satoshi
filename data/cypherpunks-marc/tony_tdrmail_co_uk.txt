It has changed since SORBS blacklisted my TOR node then. It said it was
Trojan infected or a zombie host at the time. I was told that this was
triggered by just connecting to certain IRC networks.
Maybe they have finally fixed their system.

Um, in the interest of settling this argument :
grep router cached-routers |grep -v signature |awk -F " " '{print "host "$3".dnsbl.sorbs.net"}' |sh
(most return NXDOMAIN, meaning not listed by SORBS). The ones that do, return the database in which they're listed as the last octet.
       new.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net    127.0.0.6
    recent.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net    127.0.0.6
       old.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net    127.0.0.6
    escalations.dnsbl.sorbs.net    127.0.0.6
        badconf.rhsbl.sorbs.net    127.0.0.11
Of the 887 IPs I have in my cached-routers file, 709 return NXDOMAIN. The others :
0	http.dnsbl.sorbs.net
0	socks.dnsbl.sorbs.net
0	misc.dnsbl.sorbs.net
0	smtp.dnsbl.sorbs.net
2	*.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
0	web.dnsbl.sorbs.net
0	block.dnsbl.sorbs.net
0	zombie.dnsbl.sorbs.net
46	dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net
0	badconf.rhsbl.sorbs.net
0	nomail.rhsbl.sorbs.net
So, according to SORBS, they're blacklisted because they're in dynamic IP ranges

SORBS marks TOR servers as zombie spammers I believe.

Really? In which one of the following lists does Sorbs list Tor servers?
And in what way does the description mislead the user as to the purpose
of the listing?
 1.) http.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 2.) socks.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 3.) misc.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 4.) smtp.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 5.) web.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 6.) new.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 7.) recent.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 8.) old.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 9.) spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
10.) escalations.dnsbl.sorbs.net
11.) block.dnsbl.sorbs.net
12.) zombie.dnsbl.sorbs.net
13.) dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net
They each have very specific listing criteria, but none of them specify
"Tor exit node"...
unlikely to be the case.
other SPAM
not only. In fact they check 3 "spam databases" and if the user's IP is
in one of them, e-gold just declines any operation, people cannot even
login into their accounts.
SPAM databases! Spam is, as far as I know, an EMAIL problem, so why
would a domain block surfing from these IP?
would be listed in spam databases, as most of them (if not all) don't
accept sending mail requests. That is why I rather believe that e-gold
in fact fetches the TOR exit nodes list, and directly block their IP
without any proxy, cannot enter his account as his IP address (a dynamic
one from a dialup provider) was listed 2 months ago for spam!!!
their accounts, and so their money seems to be lost! E-gold was already
known to block accounts without any warning and explanations, recently
blocked accounts of all Iranian people and KEPT their funds, now they
automatize the scam process!
