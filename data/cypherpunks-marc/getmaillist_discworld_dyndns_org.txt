Okay, your problem is clear now.  You didn't leave any space in front of the
lines you wrapped, so the parser can't quite tell what you meant.
Change that to be like this:
  [destination]
  type = MultiDestination
  destinations = (
    "/var/spool/mail/abasko",
    "/var/spool/mail/kerem",
    )

Your getmailrc file contains a serious configuration error.  But you didn't
actually include your getmailrc file, so I can't really tell you what you did
Please include your getmailrc file in another message to the list -- make no
changes to it except to change your password.
