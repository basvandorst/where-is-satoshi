If anything, the potential is worse now than it ever has been unless you
have just ridiculous amounts of bandwidth, as the ratios between leaf user
connectivity and data center drops have continued to close. The finger of
packety death may be rare, but it is more powerful than ever, just ask
Wikileaks, I believe that they were subject to 10Gbit+ at times.
At least the frequency has dropped in recent years, if not the amplitude,
and I am thankful for that, due to in no small part to what you list above,
as it mostly requires compromised bots to preform major attacks now, instead
of having many available unwitting non-compromised assists spread across the
internet like previously.
