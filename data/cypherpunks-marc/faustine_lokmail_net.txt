I suppose, but don't forget that there really is a reason they're
called "Schelling" points instead of anything else. People really
ought to invest a little time in reading the genuine article:
The Strategy of Conflict, Harvard University Press, 1960

Yep. So why not do a little something about it? I've been donating books
to a local women's prison for awhile: Ayn Rand, history books, old textbooks,
etc. can go a long, long way. Go to the local library sale and load up on the
fifty cent hardbacks, ten cent classic paperbacks--such a small investment
when you think of the good that might come of it. Magazine subscriptions are
probably worth looking into, too. I was meaning to do that myself, thanks
for the reminder. Of course "what you REALLY need" is in the eye of the beholder, but if more literate, concerned people at least made an effort to get what
THEY would want to read into the prisons,it could only be a good thing.

And now, for a special thanksgiving message from a closet Objectivist-
libertarian in the Bush administration... :)
*** The generosity of capitalism
The US is the world's biggest giver because its ethos of individualism
encourages humanitarianism, argues Lawrence Lindsey, Financial Times
Published: November 21 2001 19:54 | Last Updated: November 21 2001 22:09
Approximately $1.3bn has been donated to benefit the victims of the September
11 terrorist attacks. While this is a considerable sum, it is consistent with
Americans' generosity. According to the American Association of Fundraising
Counsel, in 2000 Americans gave $203bn to charitable organisations, or 2 per
cent of gross domestic product, far surpassing the contributions of any other
nation. Further, those other countries that were runners-up in private
philanthropy were nations that share US values and traditions. Why are Americans such big givers? Some say this generosity is merely the
outgrowth of the spectacular success of capitalism at wealth creation. And no
one should argue with capitalism's success in generating wealth, or that
possessing wealth beyond that required to meet one's immediate needs makes
contributing to humanitarian causes easier. But surely there is more to the link between capitalism and humanitarianism
than wealth creation. After all, there are plenty of things one can do with
one's wealth other than contribute it to meeting the needs of others.
Humanitarianism rests not just on wealth but on an ethos. And two aspects of
the ethos of capitalism - materialism and individualism - are what make
humanitarianism possible. Materialism is the belief that the quality of one's life on earth is important:
that life should be more than a daily struggle to meet immediate needs. This is
important, for if one does not believe that the material conditions of life are
important, no value exists in meeting the material needs of others. The individuals who commandeered the aeroplanes and flew them into the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon did not think the material conditions of life
mattered. Indeed, they did not think life itself mattered. They willingly
brought death to themselves and thousands of others and suffering to tens of
thousands for a non-material purpose. Indeed, their acts and the rhetoric of their leaders are not just non-material,
but anti-material. They believe in tearing down. Capitalism, by contrast, is
the ideology of building up; it is the best ethos for making our dreams and
aspirations concrete that mankind has ever found. Indeed, "Man Also Rises", the
painting by Frank O'Connor, husband of novelist Ayn Rand, is a rendering of a
skyscraper under construction. The symbolism behind our enemy's choice of
targets is profound. So, of course, materialism is also necessary for wealth creation, which in turn
makes humanitarian acts possible. But materialism as an ethic, as well as
materialism in its substance, is a precondition for meeting the needs of
others. The second ethic of capitalism that is necessary for humanitarianism is a
belief in the individual. Individualism places value on the sin gle person
apart from the value of the group. It requires rebuilding an individual's
spirit. Humanitarianism is not the act of helping humanity in the collective -
indeed, such an act is difficult to imagine. It is the act of helping to meet
the needs of an individual or a number of individuals and thereby assisting
humanity. This point is lost on the US's new mortal enemy. But it was also lost on that
other mortal enemy: communism. Communists often speak of the needs of humanity.
But this does not make them humanitarians, for they never care about the needs
of a single individual. Indeed, it is communism's lack of caring for the individual that ultimately
stopped communism from meeting material needs. As Margaret Chapman, founding
president of the US-Russia Business Forum, wrote of the dying days of the
Soviet Union: "It is often said people are willing to die for their country but
not to work for it." Unlike communism or nationalism, humanitarianism is not
advanced by anyone's heroic death. Humanitarianism is never that easy. It
requires hard work and sacrifice to improve the life of another individual. It
requires being there day in and day out. Indeed, the ethic of communism or socialism works to undermine humanitarianism.
If one is told that the state will care for the needs of the individual,
individuals are absolved from the responsibility of caring for their fellows. The reality of this was brought home to me when I visited Romania in the early
1990s to adopt our daughter, Emily. What we think of as civic society had been
destroyed in Romania by years of brutal Communist dictatorship. The elderly were starving in their apartments because they could not leave to
get food and no one thought it their duty to help. A neighbour of one of the
consulates died, leaving a widow and several children. The consul offered help
in the form of food and a small amount of cash. Her Romanian employees were
furious, insisting that the condition of the neighbour's family was none of her
business. Taking care of people was viewed soley as the state's responsibility.
The basis for even elemental acts of kindness, let alone humanitarianism, had
been destroyed by an ethos that denied individualism and individual
responsibility. Individualism as an ethic defines the individual not only as the ultimate
beneficiary but also as the ultimate problem-solver. While government can
perform many important functions, it is hard to think of the state as
humanitarian. Indeed, most religions recognise the individual's role in this
function. Christianity recognises charity as one of the seven holy virtues,
along with faith, hope, prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude. Islam
considers alms to the poor as one of its four pillars. Judaism has a similar
concept: tzedakah. Each of these - charity, giving alms, or tzedekah - involves
an individual act. There is no collective short cut. The point is that it is no accident that the US's attackers on September 11
were those who did not value the material and had no concern for the
individual. It is also no accident that Americans' response to their fellow
citizens' tragedy has been so generous. Paradoxical as it may seem, men and
women who are free to pursue individualism and material wealth turn out to be
the most compassionate of all. The writer is President George W. Bush's economic adviser and director of the
National Economic Council at the White House

I'll bet you all were running the risk of facing arbitrary enforcement of a

Quite a nice little collection of straw men you have there. Too bad for you
they have nothing to do with what I think. The archives speak for
themselves; I doubt you can find one post where I said any of that claptrap.
Absolutely not. I've made it crystal clear how I feel about gun ownership, the
right to defend one's life and property, and the first and second amendments.
I draw the line at initiating force though. What I find dangerous and counterproductive is your repeated escalation and provocation of law
enforcement. Surely you knew by responding to the troll you'd be kicking
it up yet another notch. What's the point? Aren't you in enough of a balance
of terror already? I guess not.
The dangerous people I have in mind are all the pissed-off federal agents on
the "domestic terrorist" jihad who are circling the wagons and looking for more
rope to hang you with. I have no idea how much they knew about whatever you were
doing, but it was the first time I ever saw you speak as if you're getting
something in particular organized. That's the way it came across.
How much of all this boils down to the fact that you profoundly relish playing
high-stakes intimidation games and would love to be known far and wide as
a "force to be reckoned with"? Just a thought.
Bah, I just believe in taking personal responsibility for my statements and
actions in a public forum. Show me where I ever said anything pro-censorship.
Nah, just a common human feeling called sympathy.

No, just that due to your wee touch of megalomania, you didn't much
mind when the troll was characterizing the entire group as having something
rightfully to fear from the sedition laws because of support for encryption
itself. That's not right.

I just happen to have this gut-level common sense belief that if people might

courage is one thing, playing straight into the hands of people who wish you ill is quite another. It's none of my business what you do, but I'll be damned
if I don't have the right to say I think you're making a mistake by talking
about it.
It's not about intuition, just reading the news and putting two and two
together. Everything I've seen about what's happening these days indicates that
law enforcement will be looking for any excuse they can find to crack down on
people they don't like. If they can keep people off planes for moronic reasons like reading Hayduke and Harry Potter, what else are they going to do with what's already on the books? It's probably just a bad case of pantscrapping
paranoia, but I still think it's better to think a few steps ahead.
If you'll look at the archives, we had this conversation a few months ago.
Nothing has changed. It sure is. That's why I think (and have always openly said, here and

misrepresented myself or what I think here, even when it goes against what
passes for the conventional wisdom around here. "Agent Faustine?" Are you totally out of your skull on crack? Use your reason:

Not "sheeple", just uninformed. Not really interested in computers for their

to have met plenty of them who were receptive to crypto, once presented with
the right set of facts.
Everyone who posts here must have their own stories of how they became
passionate about encryption (or at least interested enough to think posting

to do. If they don't feel like listening to you, of course they're on their

accessible to people of average intelligence, and below? AOL is so popular
for a reason: ease of use while providing services average people really
care about (all that family, community and chat garbage, etc).

Funny, I assumed all along John was just rorschachblotting around to avoid
saying the unsayable, i.e. bringing up the idea of simultaneous detonation of
suitcase nukes in multiple metropolitan areas. But even that wouldn't pack the same punch as if had come before the WTC/Pentagon/Anthrax crisis. The psychological impact of an entire population
seeing the towers go down in flames over and over again is probably more
significant than we'll ever know. Also, I dont think there's really any reason to assume that Americans are so
soft and weak they'd roll over and die at the prospect of a real home war. For
every hundred (thousand?) people whining around begging for the government to
hand them safety on a silver platter, there's at least a couple arming
themselves and laying in supplies to take responsibility for their own
security. All the people who organized themselves for Y2K are already there:
the fact that so many more woke up post 9-11 and started integrating
survivalist ideas into their everyday experience has to be a positive thing. History shows that in any war or crisis, some people will pull it together and
pull through, others won't. America won't be any different. You never know
how people are going to act--what they're really made of--until they're
actually put through the fire. The only thing you know for certain is that
people will surprise you.
Besides, the much-ballyhooed "American sense of security" always was a middle
class myth. How easy it is for smug and comfy desk workers to forget that a
good number of their fellow Americans face hunger and a violent death on the
street every single day of the year. Abandoned, destitute, homeless, those

What Is an FFRDC?
A Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is a unique
organization that assists the United States government with scientific research
and analysis, systems development, and systems acquisition. FFRDCs bring
together the expertise and outlook of government, industry, and academia to
solve complex technical problems that cannot be solved by any one group alone. Working in the public interest, FFRDCs operate as strategic partners with their
sponsoring government agencies. In order to ensure the highest levels of
objectivity and technical excellence, FFRDCs are organized as independent, not
- -for-profit entities , with limitations and restrictions on their activities.
This special standing permits a degree of access and a long-term perspective
not shared by commercial contractors. Since FFRDCs are prohibited from manufacturing products or competing with
industry, commercial companies can divulge sensitive information with the
confidence that it will not be misused. This enables FFRDCs to provide guidance
across the full spectrum of capabilities development, from planning and concept
design to technology insertion and integration, in a way that gives their
government clients maximum flexibility for meeting future requirements. First established during World War II, FFRDCs currently number more than 40
different organizations, and work in the fields of defense, energy, aviation,
space, health and human services, and tax administration. All FFRDCs are
sponsored by government agencies, but they are privately administered by
universities and other not-for-profit organizations. Master List of FFRDCs, 2001

maid service and sperm bank? Seriously, doing a cold-eyed cost/benefit analysis

to go through the motions of the very things that bring them the most
unhappiness is a real shame.
Or else, you could keep always looking for a woman who has a view of things
more to your liking. If you're the kind of man who posts here, I can't imagine
you'd have much in common with "average people" anyway. So why fall back on
citing the flaws of the average woman (which, incidentally, I'm not denying) in
this case.
Who said anything about noble? There are more than enough flavors of
psychological pathology to go around--but of the infinite number of problems
that can come from dating a woman as strong-willed and unsentimental as you
are, being whinily pressured to measure up to an imaginary ideal just isn't one
of them.
But nobody's forcing you to shell out cash to goldiggers and breeders: find a
woman who doesn't buy into either scenario and you're in business. They're
certainly out there, just a lot harder to find.
It doesn't take a judgment by society at large to realize that some
people really are better off alone instead of inflicting their destructive
fucked-up personality on others (psychotics, alcoholics, etc). On the other
hand, if more people refused to cave in to societal pressures and thought about
what they really wanted to do with their lives (instead of blindly falling into

Hash: SHA1
In case you haven't read it, here's a partial synopsis of Heinrich von
Kleist's "Michael Kohlhaas", written in 1810....
In Michael Kohlhaas, Heinrich von Kleist tells the grim story of how a
relatively small injustice escalates almost into civic insurrection. It is the
story of the wealthy horse trader Michael Kohlhaas.
The strange and unhappy story of this man takes it beginning one day when he is
travelling to Saxony with a couple of well-fed young horses. Crossing the
border he is asked to show his travel permit. Michael Kohlhaas has never heard
that such permit is necessary, and does not have money available to pay for
one. Instead he leaves behind as security two black horses together with a boy
who is told to care well for them. They are all placed in the care of the
castle bailiff, Junker Wenzel von Tronka.
When Michael Kohlhaas later arrives in Dresden he finds out that a travel
permit was not necessary. He succeeds in selling the rest of his horses and
returns to collect his two black horses and the boy. He finds the horses in
miserable condition in a stable, while the boy has been chased away for
disobedience. Kohlhaas is incensed and refuses to accept the horses as they are. Instead he
carries his case to the court, but his complaint is turned down, apparently
because the bailiff, Junker Tronka, is related to the officials of the court.
His wife goes to Berlin to deliver a petition in person. Guards hinder her in
delivering the petition and by accident one of them wounds her fatally. Kohlhaas swears revenge. He rides to the castle of Junker Wenzel von Tronka,
and burns down everything.The Junker has already fled to Wittenberg. Kohlhaas
follows him, torches part of the town, and threatens to continue until the
Junker is delivered to him. The Junker flees to Leipzig with Kohlhaas at his
heels. A growing number of people is following Kohlhaas. What began as a
personal vendetta has grown into a small but dangerous insurrection.
I won't spoil the ending...a great story!

a role for non-publicized privately-run remailer networks to serve as a "privacy buffer" before putting messages thorugh the public remailer system?
For example, if I had the hardware, software, phone lines, internet connections
and time to run multiple autonomous mixmaster remailers out of my basement to
route my own messages (and dummy traffic) around before funneling them to a
public remailer, would there be any way to keep all-but-the-last box entirely

And what about the idea of surreptitiously installing this kind of private
remailer network via piggybacking a stripped-down highly-anonymous version of
remailer software onto other people's badly-maintained networks--free POP
accounts to hold the traffic, maybe along with some sort of remote
administration tool for maintenance. A tiny trickle of traffic has all the
obvious problems, but is it possible that a "single user" scheme like this
might be sufficiently under the radar to go completely unnoticed? Little

investigations in ways that are unprecedented in its history.
The CIA's intelligence gathering has long been kept as separate as possible
from domestic law enforcement, which is bound by strict evidence-gathering
rules and legal safeguards protecting the rights of those investigated.
But as the nation girds itself against global terrorism carried out on American

Suddenly, for instance, the CIA will now have access to testimony collected by
federal grand juries.
And the CIA, FBI, and other federal agencies are, for the first time, being

pretending to be qualified to go into what that might entail, but if it's a
question of feeling safer for your Hydra having ten heads or a million heads,
the direction to go from here seems fairly logical and clearcut. And putting the
issue of determining who to trust back in the hands of the individual end user
rather than forcing them to make choices among 10 seems like a good idea to
me. Just a thought.

This is a great point, but it's worth remembering that even your opinions

I have a friend who used to write for a financial magazine whom I wanted to get
in touch with again. I had no idea which aliases he was using, so the first
thing I did was look up a few keywords related to a current subject
that, if he were still posting, he was unlikely to resist: dollarization and the
financial crisis in Argentina. I knew his opinions on other subjects well
enough to pick him out of a crowd, but chose Argentina first, since not many
people posting online are well-informed and passionate enough to get a first-class tirade going about it. Hear somebody rant about something a couple
of times and you know what to look for. Sure enough, I found him on the very first search, railing away and breathing
fire as anticipated, almost as if on cue. All I had to do was jump right in the conversation and trot out my own crotchety old hobbyhorses in my own

was quite pleased with himself to have found me! Harmeless enough, but I'm sure you can think of more sinister applications.

Hash: SHA1
Oh no, I just meant the ones people here are recommending most. The ones I had
my eye on to begin with, plus some .40s and others.
Concealed carry it the only way to go, after I iron all the permits out. I'm a firm believer in mobile preparedeness: in fact, every day I never leave
home without carrying a complete BOB concealed in a Kate Spade bag. And I mean
fucking EVERYTHING, the true survivalist nutcase works: first aid kit, emergency
rations, flashlight, space blanket, poncho liner, magnesium fire starter, water
purifying tabs, mini-entrenching tool, Swiss army knife, NIOSH-95 filter mask,
nitrile gloves, monocular, grundig shortwave, passport, etc etc. (Full contents
available on request, it would take awhile!)
Since I put some effort into cutting the items' weight, and densely packed and
organized everything into 3 see-through zipper pouches for easy access, I can
actually get away with going much smaller than a lot of the regular
women's handbags you see every day. Total stealth: nobody would ever know it's
not just a regular cute, fashionable purse. Would you believe I've actually been complimented on how nice it looks? LOL! If only they knew!
Once upon a time, I lived out of such a stealth bag, minus most all of the cool
stuff. Just because I'm doing well now, I see no reason to deprive myself of a
system that works. It's a nice feeling to know that at the drop of a hat I could
disappear completely off the face of the earth, survive and thrive. And even if
I were separated from my BOB, I've studied primitive skills (shelter, firemaking, trapping etc) so I know I'd pull through. With the right attitude
and knowledge, you can live through most anything. But then, investing in a solid concealed carry never hurt anything either. :)

@_subject: contextual anonymity 
Hash: SHA1
I couldn't agree more. Here's another couple of personal examples to illustrate
my point that all anonymity is contextual. A few months ago, I posted about how crazy I am about my job and office--
"I usually stay late every night and come in on the weekends--researching,
writing, coding, studying, absolutely anything I feel like doing";
it's "private, comfortable"; and in sum, I have "complete freedom to work on
whatever projects I want while surrounded by excellent resources". I still feel
that way, wouldn't change it for the world. Nevertheless, even though it's a private company, the level of security and
surveillance around here is absolutely mindblowing. A formidably locked-down
facility: Armed guards at the entry, armed guards in the parking lot, armed
guards patrolling the roof, security cameras in every hall, every bathroom;
high-tech ID badges to be worn at all times, etc. The perfect picture of a
dystopian nightmare. But my hours are my own; my opinions are my own, and I
feel more free to express them here than I ever have before. No dress code, no
internet filters: if anyone ever took exception to my browsing and posting
habits they never told me about it. Once you embrace the fact that yes, They
probably are looking over my shoulder, and no, They don't really find me
significant enough to give a damn...well, it's quite an unusual feeling.
But in keeping with being the resident Savage in the land of Alpha Double
Plusses, you might find it interesting to know I chose to live in a cash-only
hotel suite. It's not about the money: actually, I pay over $2000 per month for
rent and storage this way. It would be nice to have more workspace for my
computer tinkering projects, but it's a small price to pay.  The truly beautiful thing is, every single piece of my ID, tax information,
health insurance, and any other form I fill out maps back to a mail drop. No
phone line to tap, no physical-location information to surface in a database,
the neighbors change every day. Even my work doesn't have my physical address,
and my landlady doesn't even know my last name. Anonymity! Freedom!
Or is it?
A couple of weeks ago, my boyfriend decided to change his hair color. Nothing
drastic: light blondish brown to a darker brown. He also had a new coat on, and
left his hair down instead of pulling it back like usual since it was
still damp. Who cares, right?
Less than a minute after he left, my landlady frantically knocked on my door,
concerned almost to the point of panic: "Oh! I saw a strange man coming out of
your apartment! Are you okay? Anything wrong???" After I explained that yes, it
really was just the same nice young man she knew with darker hair and a new
coat, she relaxed, smiled and wished me a good night.
After I thought about it, I got that sickening little feeling in the pit of my
stomach again. Jesus christ, I can't even have a visitor without setting off
some kind of alarm worth investigating. How much time had she spent watching the
front door to pick up on the fact that we never have guests? It was then that I
had the epiphany that if I were doing anything I actually needed anonymity for--rather than merely living quietly and making a symbolic gesture--there's
not a doubt in my mind she'd have the cops, SWAT teams, and the five o' clock
news all over us like a cheap suit.      Or: freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.

I agree; fascinating stuff. Here's a paragraph on deviousness and psychopathy
as an adaptive trait you might find interesting:
...we speculate that evolution designed a subspecies of humans who use
deception and cheating to get resources from others but do not reciprocate. The
key characteristics of such a subspecies ought to be: skill at deception, lack
of concern for the suffering of others, ease and flexibility in the
exploitation of others, extreme reluctance to be responsible for others
(including, in the case of males, their own offspring), and total lack of real
concern for the opinion of others. These are psychopathic traits. The point
here is that psychopathy is not a disorder because psychopaths (and their
mental characteristics) are performing exactly as they were designed by natural
selection. According to this view, psychopathy is an adaptation.
Our theory is that, although nonpsychopaths are capable of some criminal
behaviour under the right (wrong) circumstances, psychopaths form a distinct
subgroup of humans who use distinct life-long deception reproductive strategies
under all circumstances.
Looks like some people around here are ahead of the curve. "subspecimens of humanity", now theres a thought...

Interesting timing--last night, I read a fascinating book which really gets to
the heart of a lot of what's wrong with our foreign policy in the Middle East:
"Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam" (Robin Wright, Touchstone, 2001).
Not at all technical, but an excellent overview.
An interesting sidenote: when Terry Anderson was being held hostage, the 1985 edition of this book was one of the few things his captors gave him to
read. Highly recommended.

Bah. I don't think it's going out on a limb to lay responsibility for a vastly
enormous amount of bloodshed squarely at the feet of Mao and Madame Mao
personally-- there's no blaming the West for what happens when ruthless people
with a vengeful streak seize power. Read Ross Terrill's "Madame Mao: the White-
Boned Demon" if you'd like some vivid (horrifying) examples of how personality
drove policy during the Cultural Revolution.  It also makes powerful statement about why giving up on the idea of
constitutional democracy is a bad, bad idea.

Huh? Where's the con? It really depends on what you mean by "humble".  Let's
see: I have an IQ of 166 (Cattell); which puts me in the 99.7 percentile of the
population. However, the Triple Nine Society--representing those testing at or
above the 99.9 th percentile--accepts a GRE Analytical score of 760. I scored a 780. So in that respect? Not humble, never pretended to be. On the other hand, when you happen to be working with a true mathematical genius
who hands you several pages of analytic work, then calls you back ten minutes
later with an impatient "Why aren't you done yet?" because he does all the
calculations instantly and entirely in his head and you're not comfortable in
your accuracy without a calculator...now that's humbling.  Or:  humility is relative.
I don't care who you are or what you do, there's always someone 1) smarter who
2) knows more and 3) has done more than you. The trick is to find them and
learn from them. Why bristle up and get a chip on your shoulder when you could
be improving your own understanding and ability instead? If you actually want
to DO something in this world (as opposed to sitting around feeling smug), you
just can't afford to be arrogant and complacent.  Though it's true that for
every problem, there's a dimininshing return on investing time in reading the
works of others, why reinvent the wheel? I can assure you that kind
of intellectual vanity is the fast track to making a grade-A ass of yourself. I
saw it happen once, pretty gruesome...the ninny sure had it coming though. Without a broad and deep reserve of knowledge to draw on, you're lost.  I
believe in adding to mine wherever and whenever I can. Having a self-confessed
big head doesn't have to keep you from being able to accept a good old-fashioned no-rose-glasses view of your place in reality. And as far as I'm concerned, nobody ever did anything worthwhile taking it easy
and patting himself on the back. Which is one of the reasons why  I think
high IQ societies are a pointless waste of time. Ugh, boring!
As I've said, if you have a superior intelligence and aren't doing anything
with it--that is, if you're content to spend all your time on the kinds of
pursuits it only takes a person of average intelligence to do or appreciate--
you're not really that much better off than if you actually were average.
Which is fine, as far as it goes: after all, there's no shortage of average
people to pal around with.  I just can't see any reason in this world why I
shouldn't hold myself and the people I respect to a higher standard. Big head and all. ;)

How ironic, then, that a lot of the most vital, interesting (and truly
frightening) work on networks and netwars, PSYOPS, surveillance, and the whole
nine yards is being done by RAND, the very same research institution that clued-in the Pentagon the first time around.
Something else I find fascinating is how many of the original Cold Warrior strategists are still alive, kicking and very much in business-- they're merely
changing with the times. Just think of the implications of that. Heavy!
The new RAND works are creating the vocabulary we use to think of
these things just as surely as the old RAND works did: "In Athena's
Camp", "Strategic Appraisal," "Strategic Information Warfare Rising," "The
Emergence of Noopolitik: Toward an American Information Strategy", on and on.
The free pdfs are anyone's for the taking at   In my opinion, people who care about these sorts of issues can't afford to miss
them. And just for the hell of it, here's a gratuitous dose of history thrown in to
tie together loose ends of several things I enjoy going on and on about...
With the work of von Neumann, Turning, and Wiener, machines that were intended
to merely model reality were anthropomorphized into "thinking objects" that
were often considered more reliable than human actors. Such capabilities of computation coupled with the ability to "accurately" simulate "real" situations
(or at least the strategists' perception that their models were correct) led
quickly to the adoption of computers for complex decision making. Researchers
at RAND asked, 'If von Neumann's methodology of formalized games can be applied
to physics, why not policy judgments?' In 1952 Herman Kahn became involved with von Neumann in the design of the
hydrogen bomb. To this end, Kahn simplified the Monte Carlo simulation while
increasing its accuracy. Modeling a hypothetical hydrogen bomb became possible
as a result. Later in his career, Kahn worked for the government's military
consultation group, the RAND Corporation. While working at RAND, Kahn settled in with a group working on nuclear strategy
known as the Strategic Objectives Committee. Its members recognized that an all
out nuclear war with an initial strategy to attack cities was not feasible. In
response to such a strategy, Kahn (only half jokingly) proposed his "Doomsday
Machine," a massive computer connected to a stockpile of hydrogen bombs. When
the computer sensed imminent and intolerable danger from a Soviet attack, it
would detonate the bombs and cover the planet with radiation fallout and
billions of dead. No one laughed.6 The Doomsday Machine, however, was only a
mildly absurd version of existing US policy: If the Soviets scare us, we
destroy their cities and provoke them to retaliate. Kahn advanced the
strategists' thinking to a new level by suggesting military installations as
the next logical target. This work led Kahn to believe there could be such a
thing as a winnable nuclear conflagration. Kahn began working intensely with the massive computers at RAND's disposal.
Modeling nuclear wars for the Strategic Operations Committee, Kahn proposed a
variety of simulations that he claimed proved his theories. At the same time,
his work had such persuasive (albeit paranoid) force, it became the basis for
the majority of military strategy during the Cold War. Kahn believed that any
war plan ought contain a variety of responses. The war had to be "controlled"
so that "intrawar deterrence" might be practiced to prevent "escalation" of the
conflict. Conceiving of 44 "rungs of escalation" from "Ostensible Crisis"
to "Barely Nuclear War," from "'Justifiable' Counterforce Attack" to "Local
Nuclear War," Kahn saw himself as the great systematizer of nuclear strategies
(Kahn, 1961). To "control" a conflict, the military needed what Kahn called
a "Credible-First-Strike Capability" so that they could suppress Soviet
strategic forces in the event that conventional forces failed. Kahn labeled the
pure deterrent capability as Type I, a first-strike capability as Type II, and
the retaliatory deterrent as Type III. These many types of deterrence, variations on possible escalation scenarios,
along with many other variables, were calculated. Using this data in a modified
Prisoner's Dilemma simulation, Kahn modeled nuclear wars to determine US
nuclear vulnerability: "If the Soviet aggressor is reasonable, he will avoid
the defender's cities, civilians, and recuperative capability in order to
maximize his post-attack blackmail threats" (Kaplan, 1983, p. 224). For
example, given a Type I deterrence, a rational competitor would most likely
attack military bases while keeping a reserve as a threat to destroy cities
afterwards. Kahn was not advocating a preventive war but was calling for first-use in the
face of conflicts that could not be deterred otherwise. As a result, Kahn
called for a buildup of missiles, bombers, and "limited-war" forces, as well as
a massive civil defense program. Kahn's advocacy of civil defense was not so
people could survive a first-strike attack. Rather, it was a strategically
sound approach to winning a nuclear war. Any country that could evacuate its
cities could "take firmer positions" in conflicts hot or cold. With a good
civil-defense system, Kahn felt going to the threshold of a nuclear war might
even be advantageous. In response to criticism that this might escalate a
limited conventional war to a strategic nuclear conflict, Kahn
replied, "Insofar as the civil defense program gives us the ability to convert
at our discretion, it should be a good thing" (p. 225). Kahn's book On
Thermonuclear War (1961) collected his thoughts over the years and the content
of his public lectures. He described the horrible side effects of radiation on
the human body. Even after graphically describing the mutations possible, Kahn
concluded, "War is a terrible thing, but so is peace. The difference seems to
be a quantitative one of degree and standards" (p. 228). Kahn followed with his text, Thinking About the Unthinkable (1962). Partly
responding to critics who characterized his work as murder, he claimed that one
must consider nuclear war as possible and therefore a topic of discussion. He
argued he was merely trying to guarantee a higher rate of survival than without
any strategy at all. Even so, many of his RAND colleagues believed that with
his models as the basis for decision making, a nuclear war might be more
likely. Moreover, it seemed that Kahn's simulations of war and survival might
be inaccurate representations of potential situations. His approach to the
civil defense problem assumed several optimistic conclusions while failing to
account for certain complications and unquantifiable variables. Kahn even
admitted his assumptions were "optimistic." In the end, however, his influence
was felt and formed the basis for how everyone conceived of nuclear war. He
created a vocabulary under which strategic issues could be discussed
comfortably and easily. His labels reduced the emotional content of nuclear war
to scientific indifference. Perhaps the most damaging effect of game theory in the hands of RAND was the
paranoid bias it introduced into the modeling of an enemy's psyche. Creating a
computer model of the Soviets' military mind was the essence of RAND's work in
strategic decision making. As in a Prisoner's Dilemma, the most rational action
was to minimize risks and maximize gains (von Neumann's Mini-Max theorem). For
two prisoners, the best strategy was to snitch on your partner before he
snitched on you. Rephrasing the problem we can see the Prisoner's Dilemma was thought to be the
perfect model for the Cold War; If you cannot maximize your gains through
disarmament, minimize possible losses with a buildup of weapons. By framing the
problem in a zero-sum calculus, the mathematicians artificially introduced
conflict over cooperation. If the "game" were not as symmetrical as the zero
sum claimed, then it would be better to think in terms of collective good
instead of individual gains.

Where you got the "deserve what they got" part out of anything I ever said I'll

wrong by the system and should be given a new trial due to gross negligence

amounted to little more than "being a scary person" and having an
unrepentantly "bad" attitude. That's deadly serious, something anyone here

Why does supporting Bell's right to a fair trial mean that I have to support
everything he does?
What isn't good about doing anything you want and being left alone. Why is getting a dirty record over easily-avoidable BS that accomplishes
absolutely nothing somehow noble? Unless you're in it for the symbolic gesture. Huh? Cops with dirty hands are criminals, the rule of law ought to apply to

Secret Plan Outlines the Unthinkable
A secret policy review of the nations nuclear policy puts forth chilling new
contingencies for nuclear war.
By WILLIAM M. ARKIN
LA Times
WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, in a secret policy review completed
early this year, has ordered the Pentagon to draft contingency plans for the
use of nuclear weapons against at least seven countries, naming not only Russia
and the "axis of evil"--Iraq, Iran, and North Korea--but also China, Libya and
In addition, the U.S. Defense Department has been told to prepare for the
possibility that nuclear weapons may be required in some future Arab-Israeli
crisis. And, it is to develop plans for using nuclear weapons to retaliate
against chemical or biological attacks, as well as "surprising military
developments" of an unspecified nature.
These and a host of other directives, including calls for developing bunker
- -busting mini-nukes and nuclear weapons that reduce collateral damage, are
contained in a still-classified document called the Nuclear Posture Review
(NPR), which was delivered to Congress on Jan. 8.
Like all such documents since the dawning of the Atomic Age more than a half
- -century ago, this NPR offers a chilling glimpse into the world of nuclear-war planners: With a Strangelovian genius, they cover every conceivable
circumstance in which a president might wish to use nuclear weapons--planning
in great detail for a war they hope never to wage.
In this top-secret domain, there has always been an inconsistency between
America's diplomatic objectives of reducing nuclear arsenals and preventing the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, on the one hand, and the military
imperative to prepare for the unthinkable, on the other.
Nevertheless, the Bush administration plan reverses an almost two-decade-long
trend of relegating nuclear weapons to the category of weapons of last resort.
It also redefines nuclear requirements in hurried post-Sept. 11 terms.
In these and other ways, the still-secret document offers insights into the
evolving views of nuclear strategists in Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's Defense
While downgrading the threat from Russia and publicly emphasizing their
commitment to reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons, Defense
Department strategists promote tactical and so-called "adaptive" nuclear
capabilities to deal with contingencies where large nuclear arsenals are not
They seek a host of new weapons and support systems, including conventional
military and cyber warfare capabilities integrated with nuclear warfare. The
end product is a now-familiar post-Afghanistan model--with nuclear capability
added. It combines precision weapons, long-range strikes, and special and
covert operations.
But the NPR's call for development of new nuclear weapons that
reduce "collateral damage" myopically ignores the political, moral and military
implications--short-term and long--of crossing the nuclear threshold.
Under what circumstances might nuclear weapons be used under the new posture?
The NPR says they "could be employed against targets able to withstand
nonnuclear attack," or in retaliation for the use of nuclear, biological, or
chemical weapons, or "in the event of surprising military developments."
Planning nuclear-strike capabilities, it says, involves the recognition
of "immediate, potential or unexpected" contingencies. North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya are named as "countries that could be involved" in all
three kinds of threat. "All have long-standing hostility towards the United
States and its security partners. All sponsor or harbor terrorists, and have
active WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and missile programs."
China, because of its nuclear forces and "developing strategic objectives," is
listed as "a country that could be involved in an immediate or potential
contingency." Specifically, the NPR lists a military confrontation over the
status of Taiwan as one of the scenarios that could lead Washington to use
nuclear weapons.
Other listed scenarios for nuclear conflict are a North Korean attack on South
Korea and an Iraqi assault on Israel or its neighbors.
The second important insight the NPR offers into Pentagon thinking about
nuclear policy is the extent to which the Bush administration's strategic
planners were shaken by last September's terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. Though Congress directed the new administration "to
conduct a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear forces" before the events of
Sept. 11, the final study is striking for its single-minded reaction to those
Heretofore, nuclear strategy tended to exist as something apart from the
ordinary challenges of foreign policy and military affairs. Nuclear weapons
were not just the option of last resort, they were the option reserved for
times when national survival hung in the balance--a doomsday confrontation with
the Soviet Union, for instance.
Now, nuclear strategy seems to be viewed through the prism of Sept. 11. For one
thing, the Bush administration's faith in old-fashioned deterrence is gone. It
no longer takes a superpower to pose a dire threat to Americans.
"The terrorists who struck us on Sept. 11th were clearly not deterred by doing
so from the massive U.S. nuclear arsenal," Rumsfeld told an audience at the
National Defense University in late January.
Similarly, U.S. Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton said in a recent
interview, "We would do whatever is necessary to defend America's innocent
civilian population .... The idea that fine theories of deterrence work against
everybody ... has just been disproven by Sept. 11."
Moreover, while insisting they would go nuclear only if other options seemed
inadequate, officials are looking for nuclear weapons that could play a role in
the kinds of challenges the United States faces with Al Qaeda.
Accordingly, the NPR calls for new emphasis on developing such things as
nuclear bunker-busters and surgical "warheads that reduce collateral damage," as well as weapons that could be used against smaller, more circumscribed
targets--"possible modifications to existing weapons to provide additional
yield flexibility," in the jargon-rich language of the review.
It also proposes to train U.S. Special Forces operators to play the same
intelligence gathering and targeting roles for nuclear weapons that they now
play for conventional weapons strikes in Afghanistan. And cyber-warfare and
other nonnuclear military capabilities would be integrated into nuclear-strike
forces to make them more all-encompassing.
As for Russia, once the primary reason for having a U.S. nuclear strategy, the
review says that while Moscow's nuclear programs remain cause for
concern, "ideological sources of conflict" have been eliminated, rendering a
nuclear contingency involving Russia "plausible" but "not expected."
"In the event that U.S. relations with Russia significantly worsen in the
future," the review says, "the U.S. may need to revise its nuclear force levels
and posture."
When completion of the NPR was publicly announced in January, Pentagon briefers
deflected questions about most of the specifics, saying the information was
classified. Officials did stress that, consistent with a Bush campaign pledge,
the plan called for reducing the current 6,000 long-range nuclear weapons to
one-third that number over the next decade. Rumsfeld, who approved the review late last year, said the administration was seeking "a new approach to strategic deterrence," to include missile defenses and improvements in
nonnuclear capabilities.
Also, Russia would no longer be officially defined as "an enemy."
Beyond that, almost no details were revealed.
The classified text, however, is shot through with a worldview transformed by
Sept. 11. The NPR coins the phrase "New Triad," which it describes as
comprising the "offensive strike leg," (our nuclear and conventional forces)
plus "active and passive defenses,"(our anti-missile systems and other
defenses) and "a responsive defense infrastructure" (our ability to develop and
produce nuclear weapons and resume nuclear testing). Previously, the
nuclear "triad" was the bombers, long-range land-based missiles and submarine
launched missiles that formed the three legs of America's strategic arsenal.
The review emphasizes the integration of "new nonnuclear strategic
capabilities" into nuclear-war plans. "New capabilities must be developed to
defeat emerging threats such as hard and deeply-buried targets (HDBT), to find
and attack mobile and re-locatable targets, to defeat chemical and biological
agents, and to improve accuracy and limit collateral damage," the review says.
It calls for "a new strike system" using four converted Trident submarines, an
unmanned combat air vehicle and a new air-launched cruise missile as potential
new weapons.
Beyond new nuclear weapons, the review proposes establishing what it calls
an "agent defeat" program, which defense officials say includes a "boutique"
approach to finding new ways of destroying deadly chemical or biological
warfare agents, as well as penetrating enemy facilities that are otherwise
difficult to attack. This includes, according to the document, "thermal,
chemical or radiological neutralization of chemical/biological materials in
production or storage facilities."
Bush administration officials stress that the development and integration of
nonnuclear capabilities into the nuclear force is what permits reductions in
traditional long-range weaponry. But the blueprint laid down in the review
would expand the breadth and flexibility of U.S. nuclear capabilities.
In addition to the new weapons systems, the review calls for incorporation
of "nuclear capability" into many of the conventional systems now under
development. An extended-range conventional cruise missile in the works for the
U.S. Air Force "would have to be modified to carry nuclear warheads if
necessary." Similarly, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter should be modified to
carry nuclear weapons "at an affordable price."
The review calls for research to begin next month on fitting an existing
nuclear warhead into a new 5,000-pound "earth penetrating" munition.
Given the advances in electronics and information technologies in the past
decade, it is not surprising that the NPR also stresses improved satellites and
intelligence, communications, and more robust high-bandwidth decision-making
Particularly noticeable is the directive to improve U.S. capabilities in the
field of "information operations," or cyber-warfare. The intelligence
community "lacks adequate data on most adversary computer local area networks
and other command and control systems," the review observes. It calls for
improvements in the ability to "exploit" enemy computer networks, and the
integration of cyber-warfare into the overall nuclear war database "to enable
more effective targeting, weaponeering, and combat assessment essential to the
New Triad."
In recent months, when Bush administration officials talked about the
implications of Sept. 11 for long-term military policy, they have often focused
on "homeland defense" and the need for an anti-missile shield. In truth, what
has evolved since last year's terror attacks is an integrated, significantly
expanded planning doctrine for nuclear wars.

Other "must see" bunker TV:
The War Game (1965)
Originally made for British television, this semi-documentary directed by Peter
Watkins was banned from television because it was considered too shocking
and horribly realistic; ("the effect of the film has been judged by the BBC to
be too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting")instead after a delay it was
released theatrically and won the Academy Award as best feature documentary of
1966. This film shows what could happen in Great Britain if it were under
nuclear attack and the after-effects its survivors would suffer in a post
- -nuclear-war world. "Sequence after sequence inscribes itself in memory...stirred me to a level deeper than panic or grief. It is more than a
diagnosis; it is a work of art..."--The London Observer. "Unquestionably the
most impassioned outcry against nuclear war yet...a brilliant accomplishment.!-
- -The New York Times. "Now comes a brilliant young English director named Peter
Watkins with a 55-minute dress rehearsal for Hell entitled The War Game, and
finally we have the full physical and psychological horror at Armageddon and
after."--The New Republic. One of the most powerful anti-war movies ever made;
definitely not for the squeamish. United Kingdom, 1965, B&W, 47 minutes.
(available on Amazon.)
"... its pathbreaking and still-powerful juxtaposition of interview,
reconstruction, graphics, titles and the collision of dry data with images of horror still shock, the grainy black-and-white imagery and use of telephoto,
sudden zooms and wavering focus creating an atmosphere of immediacy unique in
British television. Fifty minutes that shook the world."

Bah, lightweight. Herman Kahn did the math, years ago: in order to *really*
take out the New York City metro area, you'd need one -->twenty<-- megaton
warhead AND five (!) ten megaton warheads. As in actually detonating, not just
sitting there fizzing. It's going to take a lot more than one lousy dirty bomb
to do anything truly significant.
The main thing you can come away with from his "On Thermonuclear War" (which if
you haven't read yet, you really should) is that things like this are survivable as long as you pull your head out of your ass, calm down and do what
you can to prepare yourself. Too many people hear the word "nuke" and assume it
must be the end of the world; that the only thing left for anyone to do is just
lay down and die. Using your head and getting a spine beats freaking out any
day. Sadly enough, the US government is taking quite good care of its own with the
network of underground bunkers, command posts, "continuity of government" plans
etc. while letting the general population's civil defense program (something
Kahn himself pushed for tirelessly) totally go to shit. (Any PR spin you may
have heard from various agencies to the contrary, objectively speaking, it's
still 100% total shit.)
The way I see it, there's no reason civilians can't heed the lessons of Herman
Kahn personally and put them into practice on their own small scale--after all,
he was a civilian himself. Having the courage to face up to unpleasant truths
and daring to think the unthinkable is a worthy goal. If the men and women in
charge of "continuity of government" planning are cold-eyed enough to take the Kahnian approach, why shouldn't you or I be?
For a start, you could always download the old FEMA blast shelter plans that for
some reason were taken out-of-print:
And if your general survivalist knowledge, food-and-water-storage etc. isn't
where it should be, try this:
Hope that helps somebody or other. Unlike some of you, I don't relish the
thought of millions of innocent people who never did anything to anyone being
killed for nothing.  As far as I'm concerned, the more people who wake up, think
the unthinkable, and take responsibility for the protection of their own lives
the better.

Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction The Advisory Panel will assess the capabilities for responding to terrorist
incidents in the U.S. homeland involving weapons of mass destruction. Response
capabilities at the Federal, State, and local levels will be examined, with a
particular emphasis on the latter two. The Secretary of Defense, in
consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary
of Health and Human Services, and the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has entered into a contract with the National Defense
Research Institute (NDRI), a federally funded research and development cente
r(FFRDC) at RAND, to establish the Advisory Panel in accordance with Section 1405 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, Public Law
105-261 (H.R. 3616, 105th Congress, 2nd Session) (October 17, 1998). Interesting reading, if you skip the interpretive blather and recommendations
and head for the hard data in the appendices. I thought the methodology was
impressively tight and well-documented. Frankly, it's a wonder somebody hasn't
pulled it off the web yet.
Close, but not quite. I read that the author relied heavily on RAND research
(and researchers) to develop the scenario in the first place; I'm assuming that
would have included Kahn himself, given the timeframe. Anyway, it's a gross
(but common) mistake to assume Kahn was some kind of stupid optimist about
nuclear war, quite the contrary. Read "On Thermonuclear War" if you want to
understand the complexity of his thinking on this and not just the wacky soundbite version.

Even if it did, getting people focused on improving their popularity ratings
rather than contributing ideas is hardly going to improve content. The only
thing it would accomplish is promoting conformity of thought: "disagree with

some vindictive loser with nothing better to do or a group of feds
orchestrating reputational attacks against key posters? (spoofing, vote-rigging,
etc.) As long as nyms unconnected to real names have votes, the system will
always be wide open to this kind of thing and the numbers will be
meaningless from the beginning. It'll turn into just another way for the
offended to disrupt the group: think of all the people who used to post but
left, angry and humiliated. They'll be back. Anyone who reads this list on a regular basis has a perfectly good picture in
his or her mind of basically what they can expect from any given poster. How is
a number going to express anything you haven't already figured out for yourself?
Who I like to read most around here is entirely independent of my personal
opinion of them, whether I agree with their posts or how nasty I get when I

deserve anything less. Seriously, a great idea. Quick, dirty, and to the point, everybody vents and
moves on. Something else which might be worthwile is for each poster to go to the inet

her own posts. What are you really accomplishing here? Are you an asset or a
liability, a help or a hindrance? Are you bickering or contributing?  Mee-tooing or saying something original? Are you fixated on anybody? boring the

Schopenhauer came first! Not a stretch to say he was the biggest influence on
both of them, and others after. Recommended reading: "The Tristan Chord: Wagner
and Philosophy by Bryan Magee, fascinating stuff. If you dont believe me, here's
a passage from N's Untimely Meditations...
"I am one of those readers of Schopenhauer who when they have read one page of him know for certain that they will go on to read all the pages and will pay
heed to every word he ever said. I trusted him at once and my trust is the same
now as it was nine years ago. Though this is a foolish and immodest way of
putting it, I understand him as though it were for me he had written. Thus it
is that I have never discovered any paradox in him, though here and there a
little error; for what are paradoxes but assertions which carry no conviction
because their author himself is not really convinced of them and makes them
only so as to glitter and seduce and in general cut a figure. Schopenhauer
never wants to cut a figure: for he writes for himself and no one wants to be
deceived, least of all a philosopher who has made it a rule for himself:
deceive no one, not even yourself! ... And, to say without more ado the highest
thing I can say in regard to his style, I cannot do better than quote a sentence of his own: "a philosopher must be very honest not to call poetry or
rhetoric to his aid."
And one of Wagner's letters...
"I have a friend to whom I am growing more and more attached. It is my old
friend Schopenhauer, so sullen in appearance and yet so deeply affectionate a
person. Whenever my feelings have ranged most widely and deeply, a unique sense
of self-renewal overcomes me each time I open that book of his, for here I find
myself a whole person once more and see myself fully understood and clearly
expressed...which soon transforms my suffering into an object of
understanding...by revealing me to myself, and at the same time reveals the
whole world to me! It is a most wonderful interaction, an exchange of the most
supremely inspiriting kind: and its effect is always fresh, since it continues
to grow in strength. It is this that restores my sense of peace, and even
contempt resolves itself as love. --Richard Wagner
And the ending of Goetterdaemmerung was Schoepenhauer through and through. I get
a little choked up just thinking about it. Yep, cypherpunk-oriented people
really ought to see the Ring and read Schopenhauer...pardon the prosetlytizing,
I never seem to be able to help myself, ha.  Hm. reminds me of when Shakespeare expressed a somewhat related sentiment, in
Richard III...

best is write code, write code. The main thing is to DO something, whatever
your skills and talents are. Spare everyone the hot air and just do it.

pining away for an imaginary one. In the main? Not particularly. But I could go on all week with case studies
of incompetence, waste, and abuse which could have been avoided if only a
decisionmaker-- interested only in staying elected-- had been persuaded to follow sound advice instead of bad. Say what you will, but I think chipping away at the state by facilitating
privatization is a bigger achievement than than throwing rocks at pigs in a
parade. I'd rather be able to know I did my part to save the taxpayer literally
billions of dollars than know I cost the police department a couple of
bandaids and a couple of man-hours to write up my criminal record. To each his own.

in some depth obstacles to and methods for multiresolution modeling (also
called variable-resolution modeling), illustrating issues with a detailed

computational methods to identify natural phase transitions and facilitate

once said:

mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with
the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena.
The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that
it is expected to work."  This might sound a little off-the-wall, but have you considered sitting in on
some graduate classes in the sorts of areas you're interested in at Berkeley,

important not to throw an accusation like that around which reflects badly on

screw-up at hand. I have a hunch the DoD would like nothing better than to see leakees go totally
apeshit on leakers as "disinformation spreaders." Do their dirty work, save
them the trouble: sounds perfectly in line with Rumsfeld's doctrinal
emphasis on "deterrence by denial" to me. Google this phrase with "information
warfare" and you can find some pretty interesting papers online.
Absolutely, these are often erroneous and badly written. Yes, you have every
right to expect to see disinformation in them. But in this case, there's nothing lethal about adding sodium cyanide to a urea nitrate bomb-- and in
fact would likely boost the lethality by at least an order of magnitude, maybe
more. It's not as if this involved giving a precise formula or anything, just some hack content to put out a sloppy generality. Unfortunately, nothing new.

One more time:
But you genuinely seem confused. Just because some hack gets ahead of himself
and mistakenly writes "Urea Nitrate" for "urea nitrate bomb" (which can contain
any number of things, including sodium cyanide) you can't see any way around it
being deliberate, willful disinformation. Ridiculous. Why would the government
as you say, "encourage" terrorists to use something which would make them have a weapon with a far greater lethality than if they left it out? Doesn't follow.
It's only misleading to someone stuck at the level of reading equations out of
a chemistry book. 2."Chemical agent" can mean anything. "coupling" can mean anything.
No, actually I'm using the terms in a very specific sense: if you knew the
first thing about bomb-making you'd share the larger context and wouldn't need to sit around mystified over word usage and hung up on terminology.
Terrorists add sodium cyanide to urea nitrate bombs to achieve chemical
effects alongside blast effects. Do some reading. Like I don't have anything better to do than baby-step you through a point
everyone else in the whole group grasped a long time ago.
Yes. You should also do some more reading. One more time: given that terrorists add sodium cyanide to urea nitrate bombs
to achieve chemical effects as well as blast effects, I think it more likely
this was a simple error made in haste ("Urea Nitrate" used generically
(erroneously) in place of the more precise "urea nitrate bomb" than deliberate
disinformation. For you to split hairs and demand an example of sodium cyanide
used as anything other than a chemical weapon shows you are completely missing
the point.  Do some reading.

Oh, it's just a kind of poetic shorthand. The way I see it, the American idea
of justice as conceived by the Founding Fathers and made plain in the Constitution and Bill of Rights is "ideal justice". The way things should be.
What we should all aspire to.  On the other hand, real justice-- Darwinian justice--is what actually
happens in spite of everyone's best efforts and best intentions. Natural
selection, human nature, survival of the fittest, our legacy as descendants
of apes in a natural world. In sum, just the way it is...
"This is the Law of the Yukon, that only the Strong shall thrive;
That surely the Weak shall perish, and only the Fit survive.
Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,
This is the Will of the Yukon,-- Lo, how she makes it plain!"
Darwinian justice is the reason why no man-made law will ever be able to protect the lazy, stupid and ignorant from themselves; why math can only be
countered by better math. You don't have to like it or approve of
it, but you ignore it at your own peril. Adapt or die, as the saying goes...

Fine. I already mentioned the first WTC bomb, how about this from the Aum cult:
"Later that evening, station staff at Shinjuku were alerted to a burning bag in
one of the public restrooms. The flames were doused with water but the bag
began to emit noxious fumes. The fire department arrived and finally rendered
the device inactive. Later when police examined the device, they found that it
contained two condoms containing the chemicals, sodium cyanide and sulfuric
acid. The device was simply designed so that when the acid had eaten through
the first condom it would mix with the contents of the second, creating
hydrogen cyanide, a deadly gas that had been used by the Nazis in their
extermination of the Jews."
Or how about this:
GLASS-ENCASED CYANIDE CAPSULES "...a glass cylinder about one liter in volume which is divided into two
chambers: one containing liquid sulphuric acid, the other a powder of either
potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide. If broken, the resulting mixture yields a
very volitile and lightweight yet invisible cloud of hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN)
which will quickly interfere with his breathing. The odor is almost
imperceptible, but faintly resembles bitter almonds. Within seconds, it becomes
difficult to hold one's breath or to breathe normally. Within one minute,
respiration stops. Within five minutes, heart failure occurs. There is no known way to detect these capsules. The most prudent diggers insist
on wearing a gas mask with a respirator impregnated with metal salts at all
Anything else?
Accusing people of sending John deliberate military misinformation is a serious thing, hardly something to throw around without without doing a little
investigation beforehand. Why chalk up to evil what's best explained by error
and stupidity? I still think the passage looks like it was written by a hack, ref. the capitalization of "Urea Nitrate." Clumsy, but the substance stands.

pecking order dynamic as you seem to be, I'd really be putting a lot more
effort into it.
But as it is--given how incredibly busy I am--if my peculiar little set
of toys is all I feel like bringing to share at sandbox right now,
what concern is it of yours or anyone else's? Why not run along now and kick
some sand on one of your boring asskisser friends, shake things up a little...
Well is that a fact Grampy. Nattering about what interests me, alert the media.
Damn straight I do! Anyone interested in libertarian futurism really ought to
check him out if they haven't already--and I'm assuming this description
applies to quite a few people here...good starting links:
I seem to remember your having a few kind words for a work or two of his
yourself--so I do hope you won't go running down a great man just for the sake
of getting at me.
Hooey. There you go again, defining what's acceptable for people what to talk about.
Anyway, as always, it's not what you say or don't say on a list, its what you
do. In the abstract, it would be kind of useful to talk to you about it, but in
practice that's not really an option. A shame, really.
As should we all. Fair enough, but I've written plenty I haven't felt like
posting here for a number of reasons. Maybe I will, maybe not, who cares.
Even if I left it to others to post "significant" ideas it hardly matters.
You know, I like arguing with Choate: too bad you pissed him off to the point
he feels the need to post newslinks all the time. Did you catch how he didn't
start up again until you said you "quieted him down" or whatever it was? Thanks a lot.
Oh come on, that's all in your head. Like you're one to talk about being
condescending about what people know and dont know! Pot, kettle, look in
the mirror.
Looking forward to your next significant post,

I'm not so sure it'll take that long, given the amount of effort people are
putting into it. Here are some relevant articles from that single five-month
old issue of Global ID Magazine I referenced...
A long range ID system
Utilising the internationally approved 2.45Ghz UHF band allows specialised
readers to access the information contained in transponders at a distance of up
to three metres. Familiar sources of disturbance such as reflection, noise
interference and overreach have been eliminated by integrating UMTS/GSM
technologies Miniaturising transponders
by Reihard Jurisch, Micro-Sensys
The consolidated techniques used for fabricating integrated circuits have been
successfully applied to the manufacturing of integrated transponders. Antenna
coils are micro-structured onto the chip containing the transponders electronic circuitry
Smart banknotes challenge conterfeiting
by Gaia Steden
Hitachi has developed its smallest RFID integrated circuit called the Mu
- -chip, which is thin enough to be embedded in paper.
Designer antennas for RFID applications
by Bob Scher, Dynasys
The choice of the correct RFID antenna for a specific application is a complex
issue. It is necessary to consider what elements of an RFID system are needed:
from the spacing of antennas to the strength, shape and resonance of readers and transponders

Well put, actually. But don't forget, human beings didn't evolve from cats, we
evolved from apes. Our ape nature peeks out in spite of the best of intentions
in all social interactions, even here. The true greatness of the Constution as
envisioned by the Founders is that it aims for something better than the law of
the Yukon. The fact that it hasn't worked out as well as it might is a testament to
just how strong our ape legacy is: the weak and stupid are at the mercy of the
strong and cunning and always will be. Here there and everywhere, from anarchy
to democracy to totalitarian state, like it or not. Read some Schopenhauer...
