@_subject: SPCS MSL codes 
Anyone have any idea how SPCS MSL codes are generated? I believe they're
essentially a hash of the phone's ESN, but I haven't been able to
determine exactly what algorithm they use. It would save me a lot of
time if I could figure out how they do it (this would be for legal
purposes; just need a timesaver).

@_subject: Canada issues levy on non-removable memory (for MP3 players) 
I know this story is quite a bit old, but I really have to wonder how
legal this levy is.
"The Board also sets for the first time a levy on non-removable memory
permanently embedded in digital audio recorders (such as MP3 players) at
$2 for each recorder with a memory capacity of up to 1 Gigabyte (Gb),
$15 for each recorder with memory capacity of more than 1 Gb and up to
10 Gbs, and $25 for each recorder with memory capacity of more than 10
It just seems to me to be a bit sketchy to tax intended illegal usage. I
mean, that'd be like taxing condoms b/c of prostitution. Would something like this go over in the US? I wonder ...

I don't see how this could possibly be legal. How can they get away with
this? Grrrr

@_subject: Where did everyone go? 
The old Cypherpunks node (LNE) was much more active. Since that one went
down and I joined up on this one, traffic has decreased by 80% (at
least). Where did all those guys go (Tim May, Major Variola, James
Donald, etc)? Is there a different node that most people migrated to?

As awful as this is, you left out one important detail .. Check when
Riggs' (RIGS) stock price was at a 5-year high ..
