Which wouldn't have been accepted.

I understand that you only need a forward dns record if you're an end
user.  90% of the population can't put a valid key in their forward
dns records.  They don't have forward dns records to put them in.  I
agree absolutely that it would be nice if ISPs made this possible for
end users, but they don't and won't anytime in the near future.
Paul> host -t key vaio.xtdnet.nl.
Yes, its there.  What did it take for you to *put* it there (not
retrieve it).  Did you edit a bind db file by hand?  most people can't
do that.
Paul> But this only works because nerds use ssh.
Oh, I understand.  Most nerds will accept a changed key on the other
side too.  Sure, sales directors will 100% of the time I agree.  Nerds
aren't much better, probably near 50% of the time I'd bet.

This is why OE shouldn't be based on IP addresses in the first place,
IMHO.  IP addresses (even named host names) aren't static enough to
base keying information on.  OE should (have) push(ed) an identity
(not based on an IP addr...  use a cert, whatever) which could be used
to lookup the public key through a trusted server.
ssh and pgp were examples of better deployments (because the ease of
use is better).  I wasn't trying to imply that their solutions is
right for an OE solution.  They're not, and your reasons have
emphasized that.
There are also things that have failed.  Kerberos should be *much*
more in use than it is today, as it is fairly easy from an end-user
prospective.  Its just no-one runs servers...

Agreed.  Don't get me started.
Paul> Why also included the "no US code" politics, dropped by

Agreed.  Though that was an eventual failing of Free/SWAN, and didn't
have anything to do with OE.
What *should* be done for OE is to re-implement it into the 2.6 IPsec
kernel base that linus chose (because he couldn't handle the non-US
code either).
I know I've been bitten by the US stance of Free/SWAN and I had to not
select it since I needed to contribute a zillion patches to an open
stack.  I'm glad that OpenSWAN is around now and wish it was when I
was looking for IPsec stacks I could instrument a few years ago.
