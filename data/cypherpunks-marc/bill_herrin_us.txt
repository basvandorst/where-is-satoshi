If you're in the U.S., the process for handling these notices is
prescribed by law, specifically the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(search: DMCA takedown notice). It details what the infringement
notice must include in order to be actionable and what steps the ISP
must take on receipt of an actionable notice. It also prescribes
procedures for the alleged infringer to object and for the ISP to
restore the material following an objection.
Follow the procedures described in the law to retain your immunity as
an ISP. Consult a local lawyer if you don't find them sufficiently

No. It assumes that the /128 route propagates far enough that every
router (read: radio tower) operated by the service provider within the
rough geographic locality has that route so that wherever the packet
lands in the general area, it can make its way to the origin router
currently talking to the device. It makes no assumptions about the
particular path or paths between those two routers which could be
terrestrial radio, satellite, wired or even a VPN across who knows
what Internet path. It does set a requirement on the network
architecture that at least one such path must exist: network
partitions appear deadly to this architecture.
I'm not saying this is a good idea. I'm just saying it's a legitimate
topic for research and investigation which, if it shows any promise,
would support the addition of a geolocation option header to IPv6's
layer 3. By contrast, Ammar's other rationale for why to put it there
(common interest at layer 7) aren't legitimate reasons for adding data
to layer 3.

Actually, I think you just articulated the first use for Ammar's idea
that's not either wrong, absurd on its face or obviously better
handled at a different location within the protocol stack.
Suppose you have a large single-owner mesh network, such as a folks
walking around with cell phones. If you want them to have a stable
layer 3 address (and you do) then you're handling what amounts to /128
routes for tens of millions of devices. If you can guarantee that any
packet *to* that address also contains a rough geographic location
then you can discard any routes internally once they're more than a
short geographic distance from the origin and route on the geography
until you're close enough to find a specific /128 route. Tens of
millions of routes is no problem if no single router needs to know
more than a few thousand of them.
By putting geographic location at layer 3, you're also handling it end
to end which means you don't need a stateful border device to track
the current location of all of those /128 routes. The device itself
doesn't need to add location if it doesn't have the data; it's good
enough for the receiving tower to attach a rough location.
There are some assumptions in this model which are problematic. Key ones are:
1. Only valid as an interior gateway protocol (IGP). Geographic
routing has been proven false for an EGP because it induces traffic to
cross links for which neither source nor destination has permitted
2. Requires the application at the landed end to copy the IP option
information into the outbound packets as well. This behavior is not
presently guaranteed.
3. Assumes that the device will originate communication, receiving
only replies from the landed end, or will use some intermediary to
communicate current geographic information if inbound origination is
At any rate, I think that discussion of adding a geographic option
header to IPv6 should be tied up in the discussion of a routing
protocol which critically depends on its presence and can't reasonably
be built another way. Otherwise when a needful use case finally comes
along, you'll discover that the option's rules of operation don't
adequately enable it.

Geographic-based layer 3 routing has been thoroughly discussed on the
IRTF RRG and just as thoroughly rejected. It's wholly inadequate as an
approximation for topographic locality within the network graph.
Uses of geolocation information at layer 3 are similar to uses of the
"evil bit."
As is the user's legal name and social security number. If it isn't
processed by the layer 3 protocols, if they don't use it for next hop
selection, then it doesn't belong at layer 3.
Given appropriate construction of the layer 4 protocol, nothing stops
an anycasted service from responding with a unicast IP address and
using the unicast address during subsequent communication. An anycast
service has far better mechanisms available to identify the responding
server than stuffing a GPS header in the layer 3 packet.

If you hang out with criminals, sooner or later you'll encounter a
situation where there is a reasonable suspicion that you committed a
crime. Not because you hung out with criminals but because something
criminal happened while you were hanging out with the criminals and
with only a partial set of facts it appears likely that you did it.
It takes extraordinary diligence to hang out with criminals yet remain
personally above reproach. It's a tightrope many news reporters have
to walk. I have yet to see such diligence practiced in the operation
of a Tor node.

All of Mr. Weber's equipment was seized. Last I checked the cash
registers at Starbucks were networked computers too. Maybe your
Starbucks is different.
Mr. Weber lives in another jurisdiction, but in the U.S. the warrant
is limited to material plausibly connected to the alleged crime. If
the guy was shot with a 9mm and the warrant says "all firearms," it's
unlawfully broad. The most it should be is "small calliber handguns"
and not even that much if they know for sure it's a 9mm. If the police
seize a shotgun and a couple of knives, they've overstepped.
If the computer at IP:port:timestamp transmitted child porn, a warrant
for "all computers" is also too broad. "Computers which use said IP
address or which employ forensic countermeasures which prevent a ready
determination whether they employed said IP address." And have a
qualified technician on the search team, same as you would for any
other material being searched.
On the flip side, I think that if you're running a Tor node you'd
better hope the police *want* your cooperation. If they don't your
activity falls somewhere between criminal recklessness and criminal
facilitation. Seriously, who do you think uses your Tor node? Whistle
blowers exposing corruption and freedom loving libertarians? Fool.

Hi Christopher,
That was nearly 30 months ago. At the time there were no reports of
fake Etilisat certs, merely concern that the UAE's regulatory
environment was "institutionally hostile to the existence and use of
secure cryptosystems." Has the EFF's SSL Observatory project detected
even one case of a fake certificate under Etilisat's trust chain since
There's a reason Etilisat's cert is still valid and it isn't Honest Achmed's.

You're quite right about the scope of the threat envelope. And it's

The governments in question are watching for exfiltration and they
largely use a less risky approach: they issue their own root key and,
in most cases, install it in the government employees' browser before
handing them the machine.
A "reputable" SSL signer would have to get outed just once issuing a
government a resigning cert and they'd be kicked out of all the
browsers. They'd be awfully easy to catch.

AFAICT someone finds a way to get themselves a certificate for a

promptly plugged (and the certs revoked) before much actually happens
as a result. Has your experience been different?

You're right that false certificates have been issued in the past.
You're right that false certificates will be issued again in the
future. No security apparatus is 100% effective. But if despite your

that's a meaningful barrier to mounting a man-in-the-middle attack

Hi Chris,
Self-signed and unsigned are identical. The "goodness" scale is:
Encrypted & Verified (signed) > Encrypted Unsigned (or self-signed,
same difference) > Unencrypted but physically protected > Unprotected
I don't see how "feeling" plays into it.
Communications using an unverified public key are trivially vulnerable
to a man-in-the-middle attack where the connection is decrypted,
captured in its unencrypted form and then undetectably re-encrypted
with a different key. Communications using a key signed by a trusted
third party suffer such attacks only with extraordinary difficulty on
the part of the attacker. It's purely a technical matter.
The information you're trying to protect is either sensitive enough
that this risk is unacceptable or it isn't. That's purely a question
for the information owner. No one else's opinion matters for squat.

What other assurance are you looking for?
The only point of a signed server certificate, the ONLY point, is to
prevent a man-in-the-middle attack where someone who doesn't control
the name decrypts the traffic from the server, reads it, and then
re-encrypts it with his own self-signed key before sending it to you.
If the signature accomplishes that goal, it has done 100% of what it's
designed to do.
In theory a signature can mean anything the signing authority defines
it to mean. In practice, that also requires special handling from the
users... behavior web browser users don't engage in.
As for Google (and anyone else) it escapes me why you would require a
signed certificate for any connection that you're willing to also
permit completely unencrypted. Encryption stops nearly every purely
passive packet capture attack, with or without a signed certificate.
Even without a signed cert an encrypted data flow is much more secure
than an unencrypted one. It's not an all-or-nothing deal. Encrypted
with a signed or otherwise verified cert is more secure than merely
encrypted which is more secure than unencrypted on a switched path
which is more secure than unencrypted on a hub. None of these things
is wholly insecure and none are 100% secure.
