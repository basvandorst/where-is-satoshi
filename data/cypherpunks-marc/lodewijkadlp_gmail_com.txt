@_subject: [cryptography] Digital cash in the news... 
I get back from vacation and suddenly my inbox is filled with
While this is supossed to be a fairly technical mailinglist (about
cryptography) it seems clear many people haven't quite understood bitcoins'
Let me break it down:
* With a private/public key combination you can sign a message stating
you're transferring a certain fraction of value (a bitcoin is what we call
the 1 value).
* This message you sent to nodes within the bitcoin network.
* Each node checks whether or not your transaction can be executed and
compiles these correct transactions into a 'block'.
* Each node will try to find a proof-of-work for the block he made. Once he
has it, he can ship the block off towards everywhere (as many as possible
other nodes).
* Recieving nodes will check the block and when they accept it, put a
reference (hash) to it in their next block. The resulting chain of blocks is
called the block 'chain'
Now that the transaction is solidified in a block one can proof he has some
amount of money, by referencing a payment to him in the block.
How do the first bitcoins enter the system? By making a block one gets an
award. The amount given per award is getting steadily lower. If you're
thinking you can get rich quick by letting your computer solve blocks, think
again! There's only one block to be solved every ten minutes, if it goes to
fast the blocks will get harder, and there's a lot of people trying to solve
it, you're electricity will likely cost you more than solving blocks is
going to earn you. You're welcome to try though, solving a block makes
transactions happen.
What will happen when the awards are nearly gone? Then the total amount of
bitcoins will stay nearly the same. This'll happen after quite some years.
The total amount will be nearly 21 million bitcoins. The transactions will
be paid for by bounty set on every transaction. As long as someone is
willing to make the proof-of-work your transaction will end up in the block
chain and be made permanent.
That is basically the system. The whole
whitepaperisn't long or hard to
understand and I highly suggest reading it.
I know of only two (not dealbreaking) issues:
1. Transactions take time to happen (they are non-instant) (bank
transactions are much worse though).
2. Because of the deflation all coins gotten earlier were easier to get and
are now "worth" as much a block gotten now. I prefer deflation over
inflation and if this really takes of the earliest of adaptors really
deserved the money.
On the (geo)economical side I think this is the best that every happend to
the world. The bitcoin is quite violent right now, because there's still so
little value being traded with them. But that will sort out and after that
it'll just keep on getting more stable. "Regular" currency's (dollars,
euro's, yen, whatever) are only as stable as their backing organisations or
resource. Anything that goes up has got to fall, and bitcoins aren't
anything, not even air! Trade has always been based on "when I give you
this, what can I do with what you give me back?" and so, when people accept
a certain amount of bitcoins for something, bitcoins have use and thus
There is a wonderfull elegance in something we can trade at no costs,
without any ability to cheat or adversely manipulate it's amount. Even
without saying who (exactly) we are!
It's propable that when you swap something as elementary as our
not-wonderfull money with this it'll give some turbulance. And as with
anything new, especially when it gives true freedom, people will get their
panty's all up in a bunch. Usually their arguments either rest on not
understanding what's going on, or claiming that this gives a security issue.
The first argument I'll always counter with knowledge and logic. For the
second argument I'd like to parphrase Benjamin Franklin: "He who sacrifices
essential freedom for safety, deserve neither.". Surely being able to own
and transfer what you own is an essential  freedom.
I'd prefer not going into political conversation on here but I think it far
too interesting not to have it at all.

any pheriferal information you'd like to have translation off, I'm

Practically all Dutch government websites of any significance have a

trust is misplaced. Under these is the DigiD project, which is

@_subject: [cryptography] The consequences of DigiNotar's failure 
It is suggested that those that REQUIRE the security offered by SSL's party
verfication would have the knowledge to understand that SSL's party
verficiation CAN FAIL. And that those that have that require such a degree
of security could likely find something else.
The one who suggested the idea therefore assumes others assume SSL to be
broken by design, although that seems fairly obvious to me it's a big
suprise to many others. Such unclarity is dangerous and might lead/have lead
to sincere consequences, it might also not have. If it has then we are
unlikely to ever find out.
For those that do not understand my point take the following senario: I'm a
stupid person doing things others would kill me for. I know others want to
kill me for it so I hide it. I download Truecript and follow all the advice
there is on the subject, really figure out how to use it. Suddenly,
Truecript turns out to be broken (by design even), I didn't know or expect
it. Noone warned me. I am now hunted by those that wanted to kill me. Who is
to blame? Me for not knowing? Others for lying to me?
Truth be told it would be my fault, I should've known what I was doing. Yet
it would've been preferable if it would've been avoided.
TL;DR: Saying SSL is broken by design is true but still sad. Let's all get
over it and figure something better out.

These people took a known minor problem and blew it up to destroy the whole

a botnet operator, it'd still be profitable to mine with botnets. But it
drives down their impact on the hashrate drastically.

Bitcoin banks (perhaps with their own pools) can mitigate any trouble of
this kind. It might require some implementation details and would likely
ruin a part of Bitcoins elegance, but it could work.

criminal, it will fall.

without DNS. Why don't you?

register your company, you get a unique address. Strip the "Inc", "AG",
"BV" and stick to the company name. There is some cross-business-type
problems, fix them by either appending a ".accounting" or by changing
names. Allow people to register addresses but override them if a business
comes in the way.
Why didn't they do it? Politics, man.
Seriously though, we should figure out a way of splitting the
responsibility for who gets what address. ICANN is now screwing that
bigtime by spamming gTLD's. Maybe we'll abandon them completely in the
future. I suspect the switch'll be quite painful.
