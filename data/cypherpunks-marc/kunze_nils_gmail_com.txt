@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] New paper : Users Get Routed: Traffic Correlation on Tor by Realistic Adversaries 
2013/10/17 mick While tone of voice is always hard to get across in a written medium, it
seems quite obvious to me that Joe is not suggesting what you are
paraphrasing, but in fact just bringing a point across: It is not going to
be possible to know the identity and intentions of all relay operators and
hence it is necessary that tor can provide anonymity even in face of the
possibility that some relays are run by adversaries.
