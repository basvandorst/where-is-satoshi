Alert the fucking media. Why? Missing some TV? Gotta go give a five-part gardening update on Usenet? Find some new restaurants to bitch about? What the fuck, one would think a layabout pensioner like you would have all the time in the world.
Thus spake the armchair overman. But nevertheless the question remains as to why a self-proclaimed terrorist mastermind such as yourself isnt doing something far more socially redeeming--say for instance, using your secret research facility to create Cf-251 bullets for your 50 caliber. Actually, if you assume an atom density of 5x10^22 atoms/cm^3 (similar to uranium, neptunium, and plutonium) you get MFP = 1/(6.5 x 10^-24)*(5 x 10^22) = 3.08 cm, resulting in a bare sphere critical radius of 2.7 cm, and a critical mass of 1.7 kg: one-sixth that of plutonium-239. Now the real trick here is for a genius like you to surround it with a good reflector and push it down substantially below 1 kg--potentially in the "gram range". And with a good implosion system, you could expect explosive yields from as little as ~200 g. Chop chop old man, tempus fugit. Nah, better just stick to TV.
