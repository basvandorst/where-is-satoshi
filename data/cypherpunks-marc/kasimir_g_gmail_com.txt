Hi Joe,
The US government is a very large group of individuals which extends
beyond the DoD / CIA / etc borders that I believe you may only be
considering.  For example, consider the NSF.  The NSF is a US
government agency that will fund large amounts of research which have
nearly or entirely no return to the US government directly[1]. I'm
very certain that many of the NSF projects can in fact be used by
anyone---the resulting research is published
internationally---regardless as to whether they are working in the US
government's classified world or whether they are working for US
Tor is funded in part by the NSF[2], but obviously not extensively.
The NSF is just a counter example to your claim.
I'm only discussing your use of the word ``[US] government'', but the
same idea will apply to nearly every relatively large subtree within
the US government.  Of course, if Tor was only funded from one
subtree, say the imaginary "US Monitoring Internet Communications
Agency" then you might have some reason to be concerned.
Take care,
