Interesting. Thanks!
Mind telling what kind of exit policy you are using? I mean, on a
restrictive exit policy this is no surprise. Also default one or more
permissive one would make a difference.
How much % http, how much % https?

.onion is only a part of Tor. 1% or 99%? Who can know that?

I would also speculate that Tor has a lot (from western view, not

blocked in China and other countries, people use Tor for circumvention.
That will have a good impact on statistics.

Same here. So either they leave the botnet or they get two warnings and

A project providing "freedom", i.e. anonymity and circumvention for
"unfree" countries depends on countries, which are still "free". It
depends on countries where it is legal to host anonymizing proxies.
A new law proposing to make Tor and similar software illegal in US would
be a damn hard hit against Tor. And the other remaining "free" countries
can establish similar laws. No more "free" countries = no more Tor.

"I ran an end node for a month or so. I sniffed and logged the traffic
for a while, just out of curiosity. I don't know if it was sheer bad
luck or what, but after a week a significant chunk of the traffic was to
cp websites [...]"
Is this actually true? I've seen in a discussion that there is 00, yes
0.0 cp on clearnet, because there are no countries which tolerate it and
therefore all server admins immediately delete it. Most cp is in private
groups and .onion. Important: he can not sniff .onion traffic. (encrypted)
So how has he observed a lot people visiting cp sites if there are not
any on clearnet and if he can't sniff .onion sites?
I think it's populism against Tor.

This post was pointless bickering. Please stop it. It's not helping anyone.
Sometimes I wonder what Maxim Kammerer's motivation is with some of his
statements. In the thread about the Tor users page I considered his
arguments trolling and criticized him.
In any another thread, if he is right, he is right. Simple. No matter
what he said before whatsoever.
Sometimes he is not trolling, but simply wrong. Everyone sometimes is.
He contribiutes in Tor's bugtracker, Tor mailing list, Tails-dev mailing
list takes him serious as well, and he publishes source code to github.
Useful stuff.

Whonix is about explaining exactly this. Your own workstation.
Torification for anything and no IP/DNS leaks possible. (See security
page to see how difficult it is.)
The source code is essentially a collection of configuration files. (+
putting them all together unattended + distributing binary images
because there are so many configuration steps)
For example just go into the whonix_gateway folder. It contains all
configuration files. (Configuration files used on gateway and
workstation are in whonix_shared.)
If one understood the basic concept, anyone can use any operating system
to build anything selfmade...
Tell me what you need any of these for?
ttdnsd? For what do you need it? DNS queries except "A". Show me the use
case. Just use Tor's DnsPort. What's wrong with it?
polipo? Needed for what?
Did you read that link? Just use Tor Browser to share the same look as
all other Tor Browser users. If you use some speedup configuration
(polipo) you look less like others and are therefore less anonymous.
pdnsd? Needed for what? Don't cache your DNS requests. Most people don't
do it. If you do it, you behave different and web servers might detect
that and therefore you're again, less anonymous.

That's a bit insufficient and some points clearly outdated, see below.
You don't need pdnsd,ttdnsd,polipo. Vidalia is a nice optional graphical
user interface.
Someone else has to answer here.
You're on the wrong path. Don't use polipo / Firefox etc. anymore,
unless you want to stay out from all other Tor users. Use Tor Browser.
You don't need iptables for that. Tor is running on a Gateway. Tor
Browser without Tor/Vidalia started (patched startup script) is running
on another machine. (Which we call Workstation.)
Tor Button SOCKS Host: gateway IP, port: reserve one SocksPort in torrc
on Gateway exclusively for Tor Browser. Add some extra SocksPorts for
other applications. (stream isolation)
You don't need ttdnsd. I recommend using one SocksPorts per most, if not
all applications. If you still want some remaining traffic fallback you
can use Tor's excellent Dns- and TransPorts.
For a "fetch remaining DNS traffic and route through Tor iptables rule"
have a look at
and search for "dns".
You probable mess up there figuring out what is lan traffic for real and
what not. I strongly recommend the Tor-only box to have no local lan
Like said before, forget about that plan. Don't use polipo.
You can do it with virtual machines and/or physical isolation.

I tend to agree but I am not sure. At the moment I don't believe the Tor
project will die soon. It's fine with me if we can continue use it for
anonymous browsing, circumvention and so on for the next years.
It's also questionable if the Tor project should try to get a big share
of the people interested in anonymous p2p. I tend to think no, because
this opens up the project for a lot negative press. That increases the
risk for a new law to forbid the whole network in even more countries.
Let other networks try that out.

Without deterministic builds, and TrueCrypt isn't deterministically
build, [1] Open Source does not prevent backdoors, unless you compile
from source code. The ones who compiles, uploads and distribute the
binaries have the option to add a backdoor. Also the ones who may have
infected the build machine with a backdoor are in position to add a
backdoor without the distributor being aware of it.
And even in the source code you can add subtle backdoors. Source:
"The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally
create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people
like me.) No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will
protect you from using untrusted code. In demonstrating the
possibility of this kind of attack, I picked on the C compiler. I
could have picked on any program-handling program such as an
assembler, a loader, or even hardware microcode. As the level of
program gets lower, these bugs will be harder and harder to detect. A
well installed microcode bug will be almost impossible to detect."

been build from the exact same source code as claimed,

Mark McCarron:
Nice graphic. Looks similar for any country! Exponential growth of
debts. But not because mainly more and more money is wasted, it is the
money system itself that is broken. One of the biggest frauds ever. Who
has the right to create fiat money out of nothing? How exactly does
money creation work? Why is it that almost all countries are indebted?
And those not indebted, have minor funds in comparison to others debt,
don't hold the balance that others owe to them. If you take a balance of
all governments worldwide, debts are exponentially growing. To whom do
they owe the money?
In the fiat money system, amount of money in circulation equals debts.
Yes, even if you personally don't have any debts, all paper and book
money is only in circulation, because someone else made a debt. Pay back
a loan, and money gets literally destroy. If everyone could pay back
their loan, there would be no more money in circulation. One problem
with this system is, someone earns interest for the money in circulation.
So I can only encourage you to learn about the money system. Get
information from official sources. Read different opinions on how to
interpret it. Then try to conclude if it is a fair system or a fraud
system where few get richer at expense of everyone else.
