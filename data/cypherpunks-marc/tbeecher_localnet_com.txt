47 U.S.C. 230 doesn't do much for child porn, no. However, PROTECT does.
PROTECT spells out reporting, but also contains safe harbor provisions such that an ISP who didn't know that child porn was being transmitted across their network cannot be prosecuted for not knowing, only for not taking the required reporting/preservation/destruction actions as required by law.
And in practice, the process is:

Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. §230 is the US law that has been interpreted to provide immunity to ISP for the actions of their users.
Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 4th Circuit, 1997
Jane Doe v. America Online, Inc., 5th Circuit, 1997
Blumenthal v. Drudge, DC District, 1998
Green v. AOL, 3rd Circuit, 2003
Gentry v. eBay, Inc, California Appeals, 2002
Delfino v. Agilent Technologies, California Appeals, 2006
The ISP ones are most relevant here, but look at these cases.
The situation would be complicated if the ISP ran the TOR exit node themselves, and that would be a messy legal battle I'm sure.
Either way, that doesn't change the fact that running a TOR exit on a home PC on a residential internet connection is silly. You might legally not be held responsible at the end of the day, but it just may cost you a lot in legal fees to get there.
Personally, I have better things to spend money on.

Not really comparable.
Speaking from a US point of view, ISPs has strong legal protections isolating them from culpability for the actions of their customers. I know internationally things are different, but here in the US the ISP doesn't get dinged, except in certain cases where they are legally required to remove access to material and don't.
End users have no such protections that I'm aware of that cover them

Assuming it's true, it was bound to happen. Running anything , TOR or otherwise, that allows strangers to do whatever they want is just folly.
People will spend time and money securing their home wireless so their neighbor can't steal their internet, but willingly allow strangers from anywhere in the world to use their connections no strings attached. It's
