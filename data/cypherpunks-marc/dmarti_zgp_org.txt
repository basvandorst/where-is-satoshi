No match for "EXCESSIVE-ANALNESS.ORG".
Zimmermann says that the current practice of keysignings, with
government-issued identification, recitation of fingerprints
and other rituals, is missing the point of helping users get the
practical benefits of encrypting their mail. "What did I start? I
feel like I've created a monster", he told a crowd of GPG users.
Zimmermann explained alternatives to the keysigning monster in an
interview. "A decade ago it made sense to go for maximum security
regarding how to trust whether a key is really the right key",
he said.  "But things can get paralyzed by excessive analness."

(More on encrypted email infrastructure from Seth:
In order to seriously deploy encrypted email you need to kick the
email client support problem and the key management problem at the
same time.
One possible role for EFF would be as a founding member of an
encrypted email industry consortium analogous to W3C.  Such an
organization would have to be positioned as a way to fight
cyberterrorism and protect infrastructure.
It would be nice to get Ximian, the KDE project  and Qualcomm to
join, and use the words "Secure Email" or "Email Security" in the
organization's name somewhere.  You probably aren't going to get
any mail client vendor that depends on many Secret Police customers
to join.

Anyone following the "Obfuscated TCP" kernel patch

  Fast opportunistic crypto at the TCP level.
Looks like a useful way to make it difficult for
ISPs to use services such as Phorm and NebuAd to
collect user tracking data and ad revenue -- so
webmasters should be all over it.  And, of course,
it's protection against forged RST attacks.
Doesn't work if the attacker is willing to spend
more and do an MITM attack, though.

Thanks to the CFAA, violating your ToS is a _felony_.
I understand that you want to use plain language, and

with it.  (CFAA reform is a separate issue--I'm just

How can you tell people, "you're party to a legally

I'm for privacy and against surveillance in general.
But considering recent news, just once I wish I had
a remote keylogger installed on Richard Stallman's
keyboard, just to see what he's coming up with about
all this.
Charlie Stoss says, "v gbyq lbh fb".
  Bruce Schneier recommends GPG and other Free security
software, and adds, "I understand that most of this
is impossible for the typical internet user. Even
I don't use all these tools for most everything I
am working on. And I'm still primarily on Windows,
unfortunately. Linux would be safer."
  Is it really true that all those proprietary OS users
who have IGNORED BENJAMIN FRANKLIN and traded away
their freedom have been proven pathetically wrong?
Or are mainstream Linux releases already so
compromised that it's the Gentoo nerds who should be
busting out in the mocking elitist dance, at least
until the other distributions get deterministic
builds going?
