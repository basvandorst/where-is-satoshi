I would have to disagree here. Since the sentence is a question, the
verb should preceed the subject ;-)
How can THIS possibly help you?
But I would agree that it reads fine as it is, especially as the tone of

If you're volunteering, just check out the module from cvs, modify the docs and submit a patch.  All patches to documentation and code are greatly appreciated.
If you're offering paid services, you're barking up the wrong tree.
