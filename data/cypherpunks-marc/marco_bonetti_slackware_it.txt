Sorry, I've just realize I unintentionally drove the conversation
off-list: looks like this morning caffeine didn't do its job :-/
Just for reference and future googlers, this thread and its follow-ups are
a good starting point about bandwidth limiting possibilities:

you could try rate limiting the connections or adapting mine or perry's
script to your needs.

Long time ago, I torified its traffic for fun:
the problem with running a tor node directly on top of it is the limited
number of resources, at least on those old versions of the router.
(maybe I should try with a minimal openwrt... hmm...)

Maybe you could try to tickle the listener working on the idea of a server
with no exposed listening ports: a client-only Tor node could still export
hidden services like http or ssh. the latter is quite cool if the user
will survive the lag ;-)
