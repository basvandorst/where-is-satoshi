from Thursday October 11 2:12 PM ET Sun Micro CEO Sees More Support for National ID
By Broward Liston
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun
Microsystems Inc., said Thursday his long-held belief the United States
needs a national identity system has gained a lot of traction since the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
``This is more than a sea change,'' McNealy said to reporters at an industry conference in Orlando. ``I have not spoken to one person who hasn't flipped a switch to say, 'You're darn right, I want to know who's getting on a plane with me.'''
Sun developed the Java computer platform, which could someday provide the language needed for a smart-card identification system to deal with computers at airports, shopping malls, research facilities and other locations where McNealy said anonymity could prove dangerous.
``Absolute anonymity breeds absolute irresponsibility,'' he said. ``We need a thumbprint Java card in the hand of everybody in the country.''
Civil libertarians have heaped scorn on McNealy, but he dismissed their ``I'm tired of the outrage. If you get on a plane, I want to know who you are. If you rent a crop duster, I want to know who you are,'' he said.
McNealy said it would be the job of Congress to decide when people can be anonymous and when they cannot. He warned that the United States faces ``a huge efficiency tax'' for security if it does not adopt a simple system of ``Hiring 50 humans isn't going to solve that problem,'' he said.
McNealy appeared at a symposium sponsored by Gartner, the high-tech consulting and analysis firm. McNealy also responded to remarks made at the conference the previous day by Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft Corp.
Ballmer said Sun's Liberty Alliance Project, an identity authentication and authorization service meant to speed on-line transactions, ``has absolutely no probability of mattering to the world.''
Microsoft will compete with a similar service called Passport. Microsoft will go it alone on its service, while Sun is working with dozens of companies from eBay Inc. to General Motors Corp. McNealy said Thursday the number of partners could grow into the thousands. He said the strength of his system was that each partner would maintain its own customer list and could arrange data sharing with one another on their own terms.
``Hertz and United Airlines can work out their own deal instead of going
to Microsoft and saying 'How much do we have to pay you?''' McNealy said.
Microsoft believes its customer base of 120 million will make it dominant in the field. Sun is betting the flexibility of its system will make it more appealing to merchants.

October 8, 2001
Digital IDs Can Help
Prevent Terrorism
By Larry Ellison, the founder and CEO of Oracle Corp.
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, our country has been thrust into a debate over
how to root out terrorists while also maintaining our civil liberties. One
of the suggestions proposed, though not yet fully debated, is that of
national identification cards.
Many Americans instinctively fear that a national ID card would sacrifice
basic freedoms and compromise personal privacy. On the face of it, issuing
ID cards does seem a significant step. Trusting government to maintain a
database with our names, addresses, places of work, amounts and sources of
income, assets, purchases, travel destinations, and more, seems a huge
leap of faith.
But we should remember that these databases already exist, and that we
willingly helped in their creation. For years, companies like American
Express and Visa have been issuing cards and building up information on
millions of Americans. The databases they maintain are searched and sold
on a daily basis.
We should remember, too, that the government already tracks things -- lots
of things. Federal, state and local agencies issue Social Security cards,
driver's licenses, pilot's licenses, passports and visas. They maintain
thousands of databases to keep track of everyone from taxpayers and voters
to suspected terrorists.
And so the question is not whether the government should issue ID cards
and maintain databases; they already do. The question is whether the ones
we have can be made more effective, especially when it comes to finding
Do we need one national ID card? No. But the IDs that the government
issues -- such as Social Security cards -- should use modern credit card
technology. Do we need more databases? No, just the opposite. The biggest
problem today is that we have too many. The single thing we could do to
make life tougher for terrorists would be to ensure that all the
information in myriad government databases was integrated into a single
national file.
Today, every federal intelligence and law enforcement agency and all
manner of state and local bodies maintain their own separate databases on
suspected criminals. All these separate databases make it difficult for
one agency to know about and apprehend someone wanted by another agency.
That's why one of the Sept. 11 hijackers made it through U.S. passport
control, even though he had an outstanding arrest warrant in Broward
County, Fla. The FBI was searching for several other of the terrorists,
because CIA intelligence revealed they had ties to Osama bin Laden. Four
more were sought by the Immigration and Naturalization Service because
they were in the country illegally.
Such a national database, though a large undertaking, is possible. My
company, for example, has already offered to provide the necessary
software for free, and I'm sure other companies would pitch in with
hardware and support. It's important these donations be made with no
strings attached: The database would be maintained and run by the
government alone, with no question of corporations benefiting.
The uses of such a database would be significant. Airlines, for example,
could cross-check the names of passengers with names on a watch list. If
this had been done, many of the Sept. 11 terrorists would have been caught
before they boarded their flights.
Another challenge is tracking people with multiple or stolen identities.
The good news is that a national database combined with biometrics, thumb
prints, hand prints, iris scans, or other new technology could detect
false identities. Gaining entry to an airport or other secure location
would require people to present a photo ID, put their thumb on a
fingerprint scanner and tell the guard their Social Security number. This
information would be cross-checked with the database.
The government could phase in digital ID cards to replace existing Social
Security cards and driver's licenses. These new IDs should be based on a
uniform standard such as credit card technology, which is harder to
counterfeit than existing government IDs, or on smart-card technology,
which is better but more expensive.
There is no need to compel any American to have a digital ID. Some
Americans may choose to apply for a digital ID card to speed the airport
security check-in process. Some states might use digital IDs for their
next generation of driver's licenses. Companies might want to replace
their current hodgepodge of IDs with the new system. In fact, a voluntary
system of standardized IDs issued by government agencies and private
companies could prove more effective than a mandatory system.
We don't need to trade our liberties for our lives. By law, Fourth
Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure would govern
access to the national security database. The "probable cause" standard
will still have to be met.
Two hundred years ago, Thomas Jefferson warned us that our liberties were
at risk unless we exercised "eternal vigilance." Jefferson lived in an age
of aristocrats and monarchs. We live with the threat of terrorists getting
their hands on weapons with the capacity to destroy entire cities. Only by
giving our intelligence and law enforcement agencies better tools can we
expect to save life and liberty together.

At least it gives twit the advantage of the complete quotation:

New York on Veterans Day to spend money there]. "We view this as an
act of economic patriotism."

Another way to say it is if you had 50 million times more processors
than is reasonable (where 1000 is reasonable) and they ran 50 million
times faster than is reasonable (where 1 GHz is reasonable) then the
operation would take 50 million times longer than is reasonable (where

Re: FC: Valenti to Congress: "350,000 movies pirated online every day!"
  "Just a few months ago we learned that one of Americas most prestigious
   and preeminent universities, vexed by the burden of heavy persistent
   student use of its computer system, actually set up a special server
   for Gnutella, a well known mightily used site for file-sharing (a
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   discreet description of taking films which dont belong to you). This
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   astonishing action was taken by this University to relieve the swollen
   student use of its computer system. I swiftly dispatched an
   unambiguous letter to the President of that University chiding him for
   "a disreputable plausibility" which collided with the moral compact
   that informs a stable, free, democratic society. The University, to
   its credit, immediately cancelled the server."
At least we now know the Mass Media Industrial Komplex's true intent.
Remember: All p2p file-sharing is piracy!
