I actually like the new arrangement better, where Microsoft provides the
security software to its OS customers "for free".
The previous setup had third parties (anti-virus vendors) profiting from
the weaknesses in Microsoft's software.
The new arrangement provides better incentives for fixing the security
weaknesses at the source, at least as far as Microsoft is concerned.
Even for third-party providers of buggy software, Microsoft probably
better leverage towards them than the numerous anti-virus vendors.
But then maybe my armchair economics are totally wrong.
