I don't feel qualified to endorse "impossible", but for the armchair crypto spectator it does sound very much like the right thing.

There are trusted groups around that use e-mail for discussion of tactical opsec issues. The key elements are:
 - people are vetted by humans before they are allowed to join (you need N other people to vouch for you before you are allowed through the door)
 - people are required to upload PGP public keys to a central resource
 - PGP-encrypted mail to the list server address is decrypted on the list server and encrypted individually towards list subscribers before being distributed
 - non-encrypted mail is distributed in plaintext (so control over the decision to encrypt rests with the sender)
This leaves all the plaintext on the central server, which is a natural point for interception/subpoena.
It does go some way to enforcing transport security for mail, however (making it harder to intercept STARTTLS-or-not paths between list server and mailbox).
The membership vetting can no doubt be gamed, but it provides at least some barrier to infiltration-as-member.
The fact that you're sending mail to the "list" is still trivial to identify from a packet-level intercept, even if the content of the conversation is obscured.
