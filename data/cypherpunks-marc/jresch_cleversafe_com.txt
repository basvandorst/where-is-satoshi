I would define that combination as a threshold secret sharing scheme.  Noting of course what you said below in that it is a computationally-secure as opposed to Shamir's information theoretically secure scheme.
Recalling what the original poster said:
"Surely this is fundamental to threshold secret sharing - until you reach the threshold, you have not reduced the cost of an attack?"
Cleversafe's method does have this property, the difficulty in breaking the random transformation key does not decrease with the number of slices an attacker gets.  Though the difficulty is not infinite, (as is the case with an information theoretically secure scheme) it does remain fixed until a threshold is reached.

You have stated how Cleversafe manages the key but not provided any details regarding how Tahoe-LAFS manages the decryption key?  In your documentation it was stated that many of your users choose to store the capability (containing the key) for their root file on your data storage servers.  I would think that this results in less security than Cleversafe's approach because our servers enforce authentication and access controls.
I agree.  I should also note that the use of AES-256 or any cipher is a configuration parameter for our generalized transformation algorithm, which also can support stream ciphers.
Symmetric ciphers frequently break in small pieces at a time, reducing the number of bits of protection below what would be expected for the given key length.  If an asymmetric algorithm were to break (due to finding solutions to factoring or discrete logarithms) those algorithms would fail utterly, no length of a key could be considered secure.  This of course has not happened yet, but it remains a possibility unless it is someday proven that there is no efficient solution.  Even if math does not provide a path to breaking asymmetric ciphers, physics does by way of quantum computing.
Hundreds of symmetric ciphers have been devised and as weaknesses are found in currently used symmetric ciphers it is easy to migrate to other well-vetted algorithms.  Asymmetric ciphers are in short supply, and depend on discover trap door functions in math, so a break in them would offer fewer exit strategies.
We evaluated that approach shorlty before discovering the AONT and I believe it has similar security properties.  The AONT was much simpler to integrate, however, as it is a single pre-processing step before the IDA.
It is fundamentally safer in that even if the transformation key were brute forced, the attacker only gains data from the slice, which in general will have 1/threshold the data.  Also, it avoids the threats to asymmetric cryptography that I mentioned above.
Many modern cryptosystems use 1024-bit RSA keys, (my bank's website for example).  The security of a 1024-bit RSA key is about equivalent to an 80-bit symmetric key.  Assuming a conservative estimate for Moore's law of doubling processing power every 2 years, a bot-net owner with 1,000,000 computers could reach that point in 28 years.  Existing trends show doubling ever 18 months, which reduces this time to about 20 years.
I think your points were clearly written and professional.

With a secret sharing scheme such as Shamir's you have information theoretic security.  With the All-or-Nothing Transform and dispersal the distinction is there is only computational security.  The practical difference is that though 2^-256 is very close to 0, it is not 0, so the possibility remains that with sufficient computational power useful data could be obtained with less than a threshold number of slices.  The difficulty of this is as hard as breaking the symmetric cipher used in the transformation.
Is there any data storage system which does not require some protection against attackers, resiliency to media failure, and trusted administrators?  Even in a systems where one encrypts the data and focuses all energy on keeping the key safe, the encrypted copies must still be protected for availability and reliability reasons.
The security provided by this approach is only the icing on the cake to the other benefits of dispersal.  Dispersal provides extremely high fault tolerance and reliability without the large storage requirements of making copies.  See this paper "Erasure Coding vs. Replication: A Quantitative Comparison" by the creators of OceanStore for a primer on some of the advantages: If a particular "vault" (Our term for a logical grouping of data on which access controls may be applied) had data stored on on a threshold number of compromised drives, then data in that vault would be considered compromised.  Our systems tracks which vaults have data on which machines through a global set of configuration information we call the Registry.
When drives or machines are known to be lost or compromised one may perform a read and overwrite of the peer-slices.  This makes obsolete any slices attackers may have accumulated up until that point.  This is due to the fact that the AONT is a random transformation, and newly generated slices cannot be used with old ones to re-create data.  Therefore this protocol protects against slow accumulation of a threshold number of slices over time.
Please let me know if you have any additional questions regarding our technology.
