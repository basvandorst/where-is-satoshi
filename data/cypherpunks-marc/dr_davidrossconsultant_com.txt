Actually "they" didn't "shut him down". Per news reports and the founder's statements.
You can read the details and fact if you want.

Not yelling at Walter.
The problem with all of this is that as long as our Congress (and the equivalent in other countries) passes laws that allow such backdoors with a threat of jail if you talk about it at any level we will have these issues.
If you want this to go away, then we need to elect folks to Congress who will change the laws.
But for most of us that's too big a hill to climb in terms of personal effort so we don't do it.
