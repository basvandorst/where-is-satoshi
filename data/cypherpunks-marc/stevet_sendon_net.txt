Quoting Trei, Peter (ptrei
I wonder why they bother with such polls.  At this time, there is enough
legislation and political will to mandate `more government' involvement in
people's lives without the need for unscientific study.
Not only is there a need for a war to boost the flagging economy, but
obviously the future security of the human race _depends_ on omnipresent
government intrusion in the affairs of man.  What, exactly, is gained by these silly pretences at polling the people for
their opinions when the unassailable logic of military necessity is sufficient
unto itself?  I suggest that journalists explain, in simple terms, the facts
of national security to the public.  Properly presented, the majority will
easily accept the inevitable without complaint since the only other option
will be to abandon facts and logick for chaos and uncertainty.

Doesn't that depend on how quickly they co-operate with the feds?  Surely
highly intelligent citizen-units will be given the opportunity to save their
property from confiscation in exchange for their services towards furthering
the war effort.

How much of that is PR is perhaps open to debate, but there are certainly
enough cases where their sadistic tendencies, as you say, have resulted in
significant damage to peoples lives without reason.
I can't comment on the suitability of Norton Ghost for the purpose of making
an image copy of a hard-disk, but the argument is specious at best.  If they
haven't got the procedures in place to assure the proper evidence handling in
that case and therefore need the hardware, then evidence gathered by covert
means (i.e., the copying of a `suspect's' data via either a black-bag job or
by way of tempest surveillance) is just as suspect.
And incidentally, it's obviously quite easy to install arbitrary files on
someone's computer in the same way that a crooked cop might `find' a bag of
cocaine in someone's bathroom.
The long and short of it is that they're obviously full of shit.
Which is probably a trivial task.  But these sorts of incidences are probably
simply harassment and intimidation.  Amusing, isn't it, that the people
nominally responsible for maintaining order and the safety of a country's
civilians are the ones who would cause just as much (or more) harm to their
citizenry than would a putative criminal.
Some would no doubt argue that such measures are the price of liberty.

I'll bite this one. Quoting Luthor Blisset (saeq
Then they probably aren't anarchists.
Anarchy won't work unless _everybody_ cooperates in good faith.  And it ain't
gonna happen.  It is more likely that a state of actual anarchy would result
in a minor restructuring of the democratic pattern of two wolves and a sheep
deciding what to have for dinner.
Ideally, intellectual property (or more properly, knowledge) would always be
in the public domain.  For that to be viable, something, perhaps a gift
economy, would have to replace currently competing systems.  And it ain't
gonna happen.  Too many people enjoy not only the simple material benefits of
capitalism (to name one), but more importantly, the power which it gives them
to manipulate their environment to suit their will; and which includes, of
course, people.
Patterns of domination and so forth are obviously far too deeply ingrained in
the human psyche to make viable any meaningful change towards flattening
somewhat bottom-heavy wealth and power hierarchies.
We now return to the ongoing coverage of the American Anthrax Attack.
