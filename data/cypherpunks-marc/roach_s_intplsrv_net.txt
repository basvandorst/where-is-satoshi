He probably did, along the lines of Sir, it didn't work.
Personally, I think we should INCREASE crypto over this.  Put a crypto imbedded radio in the planes control electronics, with the key known only to the FAA, and existing only for that flight.  If there are flight problems, hit a switch from the tower and take over the plane from the ground.  Either instruct the autopilot to land at a pre-determined contingency location, fly it by remote from a simulator, or blow it up before it can be used as a battering ram.  The former two useful for on-flight emergencies too, such as an unconsious pilot.  Something else to consider.  Knockout gas in the passenger compartment and a solid door between passenger compartment and cockpit.
Also, why are we putting so many clerks in a handful of offices anyway?  Isn't this supposed to be the age of the paperless office?
Shoot, this time next week, 3-inch pocket knives are going to be on the proscribed list for commercial flights, when the opposite should be true.

I got the invite as well.  It LOOKS like they might be adding a little of the OLD Freedom back in.  Anyone know if it's more than one proxy server, and if ZKS is going to control it/them?
I haven't uninstalled freedom 3.0, but I haven't used Freedom at all since they pulled the tunneling.
