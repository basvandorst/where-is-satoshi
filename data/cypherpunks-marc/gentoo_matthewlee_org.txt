Well skype upgraded this morning to version 1.4.0.74 and it aint working.
When I tried running it from the command line I get the following:
open shared object file: No such file or directory
revdep-rebuild doesn't pick any thing up
Do I have to rebuild Qt? or another package?  which one provides that library.
I've tried down-grading to the previous version but that's now been This is a real pain in the buttocks.  How can I phone home now? I can't afford the rip-off international phone charges at the moment!
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
