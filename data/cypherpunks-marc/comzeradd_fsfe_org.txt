Since this is mostly for synchronous communication, you can inflict jabber+otr, which has all the benefits you mention above.

On Mon, Mar 23, 2015 at 6:05 PM, Cathal Garvey I guess you are talking about the CDM module. Yes, that's not Open Source, but that doesn't ship along with Firefox. It's pretty much the same as with NPAPI plugins. Implementation is Open Source, but (for instance) Flash plugin is not. Thus it's not shipped with Firefox.
Well. The "sandbox" in which closed-source EME malware runs is Open Source, the EME malware itself is not; if it were, it wouldn't achieve its intended goals of preventing the user from accessing media without interference.I guess you are talking about the CDM module.

Same goes for EME. The Firefox implementation is Open Source.
Firefox Hello, which might be to blame, is on-topic though; is that module even open source? Mozilla are really sinking fast (ahem, EME) as a thought-leading ideology hub, so it wouldn't surprise me to learn they were bundling closed-source-open-port-ware.Hello is part of Firefox's codebase, so yes it's fully Open Source. goes for EME.
