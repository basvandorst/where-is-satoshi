Hash: SHA1
I just read the latest CRYPTO-GRAM, June 15, 2007, by Bruce Schneier.
"We have a new factoring record:  307 digits (1023 bits).  It's a
special number -- 2^1039 - 1 -- but the techniques can be
generalized.  Expect regular 1024-bit numbers to be factored soon.  I
hope RSA application users would have moved away from 1024-bit
security years ago, but for those who haven't yet: wake up.
 "
I suppose this means that 1024 bit RSA-keys are ridiculous and the
Open PGP Card is a joke. And what about all web sites protected by
SSL with a 1024-bit RSA-certificate?
