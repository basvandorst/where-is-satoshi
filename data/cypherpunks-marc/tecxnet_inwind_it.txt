Hi, my friend, I'm Matthew.
It has been several week since I wrote to you.
I'd like to thanks a lot for your technical support.
And, of course, I'm writing you the final question, hihihihihihi ^_^
I downloaded the faq page and I'd like to ask you a thing.
Could you be more specific in the differences between SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and
I'm asking because isnot mentioned anything about SNMPv3.
Can you tell me?
Thank you for everything, Dave.
You have been very helpful.
See you,
