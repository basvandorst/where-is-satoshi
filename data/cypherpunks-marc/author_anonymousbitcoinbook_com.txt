Pay-to-route seems likely in the future for the capitalists amongst participants in P2P routing networks. Bitcoin is as good a medium for that to take place as any, but great care would need to be taken in order not to ruin the anonymity achieved through using Tor. It would be especially tricky to try to dole out payments for each message relayed, but that doesn't mean it can't or won't happen.

Interesting. Has anyone compared it to Tails Linux?

Ernie Allen from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children was a real disappointment, insofar as his statements about anonymity and government control were incredibly myopic.
If your plan to protect children is to initiate force against people of all ages, you're going to have a bad day...

1) Ew, if it's real. Nothing good can come from that.
2) Probably not real, but just a honeypot.
Interesting find, in any case.
