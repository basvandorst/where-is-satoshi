As the hint says, use the label function.  Here's how:
1.  From menu File->New->Labels
2. a. insert ANY text in the Label Text box,
   b. In brand, select Avery Letter Size (or appropriate size)
   c. in Type, select something like 5371 Business Card - White
3.. click the Options tab
   a. Select entire page option
   b. select Synchronize contents
   c. Click New Document button
4. Select the top-left frame, insert objects and text and format your
business card, then click the floating button that says Synchronize Labels.
Voilá! you have 10 business cards on the page, ready to print!
(Optional)  If you insert names and data fields, including photos, from a
database, this can be used with the Form Letter function to print ID cards.
Works great!
Hope this is useful,
Matt Needles
