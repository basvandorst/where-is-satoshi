I didn't have to say: can we change the meeting from 6 to 11?  My kids have a music recital and I dont want to miss it for the world.  What is the answer?  I'd walk down to the stream, look around, and take a deep breath.  Can you tell me the answer? she asked.
(I'd seen something really weird. :)  There's something I should tell you.  I'm cold, you said, staring at the continuation we had to feel through yesterday.  The same thing we do every night, he replied.   And someone was waiting for me, just around the corner.  (I'm loving the way you walk with me so quietly, contentedly.)  But this was a long road, and should I walk down it, I might never come back.  I'd seen many of the same things I've seen before.What are we going to do tonight? I asked.  This is what I like, I'd tell myself.  What are we going to do tonight? I asked.  Suddenly, she wasn't there. That could well be the answer.
