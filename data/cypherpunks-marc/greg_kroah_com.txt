Reducing the attack surface is great, but that's not what was asked
about here...
I'd argue that you never will be, you will always be behind the curve
here due to the nature of the hardware business model.  Specific
example, what about 40Gbit network adapters?  10Gbit?  1Gbit?  How far
back on the curve of current hardware capabilities do you have to go to
get "open" hardware?
I agree, but again, that wasn't what you claimed.
6092693E is not for communication, it's a signing key (yeah, I left on
the encrypted portion, and didn't just generate a signing key, my fault,
sorry.)  My other "communication" key is on the keyservers, it should be
easy to find if you want to use it.
But how can you know to trust it, and me?  :)

The kernel will not do this if you leave the compile.h file around, so
check that into your build system and you should be fine.  If there are
other problems with the kernel build system not being deterministic,
please let me know, as I thought they had all been resolved for a while

Yes, that's where I am due to a lack of better choices as well.
There's tons you can do to mitigate risk, and enhance trust, but that
wasn't the original question :)
It all depends on what type of threat model you want to protect from,
security, and trust, is in layers, not absolutes.
If you have the resources (like your employer and foreign governments),
then there are lots of things that can be done to mitigate risk and
enhance trust, it all depends on how much time and resources you want to
But, back to the original question that started most of this thread out:
Ironically, I'm arguing the other side of this type of thing right now
on the linux kernel mailing list, where people are trying to shut down
too many things, removing valid options at the expense of people who
have different risk models...

Then don't assume that all distros have this type of problem please.
And it makes automated builds an almost impossible thing to achive, so
it's not realistic.
Agreed, and I think that other distros already do this, Debian might be
the exception :(
Projects almost always gladly accept patches and review, what's stopping
anyone from doing this today?  I know of a handful of people who started
doing this for the Linux kernel a few years ago and instantly got job
offers to continue doing this full-time.  Some of them accepted and have
been working very well on fixing a huge range of issues.  Some decided
to stay where they were and continue to churn out great tools that let
us fix these issues (academia is a good place for stuff like this.)
Those tools work on all projects if they wish to be used, it's only a
matter of the developers using them.
Have them go to FOSDEM, where all the distros have a multi-day track to
work on issues that encompass them all.

I don't believe you.  Seriously, I don't.  You really have a way to
"remove" the keyboard controller?  What about your USB host controller?
Oh, you are using PS/2?  What about the firmware in that controller
chip?  The microcode in the processor?
Open drivers aren't the real issue.  Hardware you can "trust" is.
That's the same as saying, "I have a pink elephant, but I can't show
you, you'll just have to trust me."
As you don't trust anyone, why should I trust you?
Those boards have some open HDL, which is great, but not all of it is
open, you still have to rely on blobs from companies that you may, or
may not, trust.
And that's the problem you can not solve.
"slightly", but still vaporware.
"Small kernels" fall apart when they hit modern systems and real-world
devices and scenarios.  It's as if people never learn from past
mistakes, sad.  But it makes for nice research papers, so they continue
to be worked on.

What are the problems in the existing processes that you feel are week?
For example, what is wrong with openSUSE's signing process that you feel
are wrong?
What type of review?  What type of process would catch stuff like that?

What hardware is that?
The CPU is the least of your worries, but still something that can be
subverted.  There's network controllers, internal bridges (do you know
how many ARM cores are in your north/south bridge?  lots), routers (the
big problem), and even things as "simple" as a keyboard controller and
mouse controller (I got started in Linux by writing keyboard and mice
firmware, you can do a lot in those little things).  All of which could,
and probably should, not be "trusted".  There's no way for anyone to
"validate" all of those.
And then the big issue is what your devices talk to, how can you
validate them?
Yes, trust is a continuum, just like society, it's something you have to
have in order for people to be able to survive together.
People have been "working" on this for many decades now.  There's lots
of reasons why this will never happen.
What hypervisors work on "open" hardware?

Ob. plug:  It's a good talk, what these people did to upgrade their
systems is a pretty amazing task given the size, complexity, and
contraints they were under.  Highly recommended.  So much so I think
I'll go sit through it again :)

Fair enough, so, given the news over the past months, what do you
suggest that we do to help address the issues raised?
Reproducable builds is one good thing, that can be done, and distros
should work on that if they wish to give some type of assurances to
their users.
A number of people have been tirelessly working on auditing our bodies
of code, putting into place checks to prevent errors, once they have
been fixed, to come back.  Static code analysis is good to do, and is
a big step in the right direction.
But what else needs to be worked on?  What gaps do people feel we have
that are cauing problems that we can solve with technological measures,
not just legal ones?

"other" distributions?  openSUSE/SLES/Fedora/RHEL has a "simple" way to
prove this, just take the source rpm and rebuild it yourself and check
that it stays the same, modulo any date/time stamps.  Yes, lots of
programs do have those in them, but that can be fixed pretty easily if
the developers want to.
Heck, make a local instance of OBS, and use it to rebuild your whole
distro, it can build anything but Gentoo packages these days.
Speaking of Gentoo, lots of companies use that instead of the
"enterprise" distros, rolling their own packages and distributing system
images, or binary packages, to their own systems, signed with their own
Gentoo's current design trusts way _more_ people, given that a large
number have access to the whole portage tree, and can check anything in,
I'm still confused about Don's original point here, what exactly is it?

What exactly do you mean by "compromised"?
Gentoo's build system is "deterministic"?  In what manner?
How is Debian's and openSUSE's and Fedora's somehow different from
