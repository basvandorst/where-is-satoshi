This is why, for example, we have a postal system which manages

Oh no, the idiotic penny black idea rides again.
Like the movie "War Games" when a young Matthew Broderick saves the
world by causing the WOPR computer to be distracted into playing
itself tic-tac-toe rather than launching a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
It was a MOVIE, made in 1983 nonetheless, get over it.
More seriously, what attracts people to this penny black idea is that
they realize that the only thing which will stop spammers is to
interject some sort of economic constraint. The obvious constraint
would be something like stamps since that's a usage fee.
But the proposer (and his/her/its audience) always hates the idea of
paying postage for their own email, no, no, there must be a solution
which performs that economic miracle of only charging for the behavior
I don't like! An economic Maxwell's demon!
So, just like the terminal seeking laetrile shots or healing waters,
they turn to not even half-baked ideas such as penny black. Don't
charge you, don't charge me, charge that fellow behind the tree!
Oh well.
Eventually email will just collapse (as it's doing) and the RBOCs et
al will inherit it and we'll all be paying 15c per message like their
SMS services.
I know, we'll work around it. Of course by then they'll have a
multi-billion dollar messaging business to make sure your attempts to
by-step it are outlawed and punished. Consider what's going on with
the music-sharing world, as another multi-billion dollar business
people thought they could just defy with anonymous peer-to-peer
The point: I think the time is long past due to "grow up" on this
issue and accept that some sort of limited, reasonable-usage-free,
postage system is necessary to prevent collapse into monopoly.

I agree with Dave, I think this idea that it's an urban legend has now
become an urban legend.
If you focus it down very sharply like this:
     DARPA specified (or, perhaps, the project was sold to DARPA with
     a promise...) that the network being designed in the late 1960s
     should be resistant to a nuclear attack.
That's probably an urban legend, who knows, it's probably not all that
But was it observed over and over from the early on that a packet
network, versus the then predominant technology of virtual (or even
real) circuit networks, would be resistant to damage of all sorts?
Another early motivation which isn't often mentioned in these
discussions was the sharing of supercomputer resources.
Supercomputers generally cost tens of millions of dollars back then,
approaching $100 million if you took the infrastructure into account.
I worked on a $100M supercomputer proposal as it evolved into 50 tons
of chilled water on the roof to shoring up the roof to hold that much
water, to running a private gigawatt power line from the local utility
thru Boston...etc.
And the sort of people who needed access to those supercomputers were
spread across the country (and world of course.) It was becoming a
matter of whether to move the researchers, not very practical (how
many finite element analysis experts do you really need at one
university?), or buy each of them a supercomputer (kind of expensive),
or try to hook them up remotely.
At first dial-up seemed plausible but data visualization, graphical
access, became more and more important even in the late 1970s and
early 80s. Researchers were shipping large cartons of magtape so they
could use local computers to generate graphical results of their
computations. It was unwieldy to be kind.
The internet was a good answer to that problem, and that vision of
"high-speed" (for the era) remote access certainly factored into
proposals such as the JVNC-era proposals, NSFnet, etc.

I dunno, has it ever happened? I mean confiscated the store's
equipment, I assume that's what you mean. Is that because no one has
ever been involved with child porn etc from a Starbucks? Does that
seem likely? I don't know, really.
And why would confiscating it from one location address the issue if
they offer anonymous hotspots (I don't know if they do but whatever,
there are plenty of others) at all locations and they're one company?
It would seem like they'd have to confiscate the equipment at every
Starbucks in their jurisdiction, which could be every one in the US
for example.

Back in the early days of the public internet we didn't require any id
to create an account, just that you found a way to pay us. We had
anonymous accts some of whom dropped by personally to pay their bill,
some said hello but I usually didn't know their names and that's how
they wanted it, I'd answer "hello ", whatever their login was
if I recognized them. Some mailed in something, a mail order, even
currency tho that was rare but it did happen, or had someone else drop
by to pay in cash (that is, no idea if they were local.)
LEO occasionally served a warrant for information, usually child porn
biz (more than just accessing child porn, selling it) tho I don't
remember any anonymous accts being involved.
I never expected to be held accountable for anyone's behavior unless I
was knowingly involved somehow (just the usual caveat.) LEO never
showed any particular interest in the fact that we were ok with
anonymous accounts. If I was made aware of illegal activities we'd
shut them off, didn't really happen much, maybe some credible
"hacking" complaint on occasion.
It's funny, it's all illusion like show business. It's not hard to set
up anonymous service, crap, just drop in at any wi-fi hotspot, many
just ask you to click that you accept their T&Cs and you're on. Would
they raid them, I was just using one at a major hospital this week
that was just like that, if someone used that for child porn etc? But
I guess stick your nose out and say you're specifically offering anon
accts and watch out I guess.

it's their butts on the line not yours if there's an attack. Or yours

are, or were, intellectuals behind AQ, some no doubt bright.

entirely constructive.
