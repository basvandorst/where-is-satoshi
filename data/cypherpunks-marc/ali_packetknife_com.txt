Alright, I can understand your argument and you and Roger are speaking
from experience.
And I like this version of a FOSSH response. Thanks for the education, -Ali

I find it curious that ~credibility~ of tor is being called into
question by some. The source is readily available, the libraries it
compiles against are readily available, the change logs, code control
records, etc. are all readily available. Certain contributors to tor
have come under fire from various Governments and private
institutions. For bloody sin sake EVERYTHING has had Uncle Sam
involved in some variable way at this point. Linux, GCC, sendmail,
bind, etc. etc.
FUD is an energy stealer and if you can afford that energy loss then
at least put it to good use auditing and tracking down bugs or any
backdoors you suppose. -Ali

Part of the problem is that most people can't even wrap their heads
around what a State or non-State Tier 1 Actor would even look like.
They bully, kill leaders, deny resources, .. heck, they kill ~users~
to dissuade use of a given tool.
Then on the flip side "we" think about design and architectural
aspects that don't even ever get the chance to be used against ~any~
adversary because we force too much philosophy down into a hole that
may have just one device, maybe just an iPhone - and limited to
connectivity to even use it.
I've called this the problem of "Western Sensibilities" where we seem
to forget the economics and geopolitics of the rest of the world.
Before getting heads wrapped around all these poles that are pretty
exclusive to the "haves" - go out to truly hostile territory and live
like a "have not" and try to build up the OPSEC routine you want,
complete with FOSS only and full audits, and work from the field that
way. It's non-trivial to say the least - even if you've done it a
hundred times from a hundred different American and European venues.
