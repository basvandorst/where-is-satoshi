Heh ... just wanted to let you know that there is an error on the freebsd home page ... it's the yellow button that says 'Get FreeBSD Now' and there seems to be an issue with the letters 'G' and 'e' from the word 'Get' and also wth the letter 'w' at the end of 'Now' where the bottoms of those letters are missing (partly missing for the letter 'e')

windows xp,
