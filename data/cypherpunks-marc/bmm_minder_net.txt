@_subject: moderated CDR node 
cypherpunks-moderated is a moderated version of the
cypherpunks CDR node.  The moderation policy is vaguely:
- obvious spam gets dropped.
- one-line pointers to news articles will tend to get dropped.
- news articles posted in full without comment will tend to get dropped.
- content will tend to get passed, even if it's off-the-wall
  (eg. Xenix Chainsaw Massacre).
- submissions from high signal posters will tend to get passed.
- the list is read-only. submissions should go to cypherpunks
  or another CDR node. - cypherpunks will remain unfiltered and unmoderated.
To subscribe, send the text "subscribe cypherpunks-moderated" to

Thanks to John for pointing out that subscribing was broken for the minder.net node.  It's now working again.

cypherpunks is an unfiltered node and as such receives a fair
amount of spam.  cypherpunks-moderated is a by-hand moderated node.  Some other folks here have expressed interest in using Eric's
auto-moderating setup at a new node.
