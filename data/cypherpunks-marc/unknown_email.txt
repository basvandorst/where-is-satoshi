"We'll catch those 'folks' that did this", pledged President Sharon in direct reference to President Bush's words of just over a month ago.
Israel has access to some of the world's most advanced weaponry, and may use this against the terrorists. From jet fighters and helicopters for attacking the infrastructure of the nation harboring the terrorists, to sending in troops on the ground.
Do non-governmental actions constitute acts of war? In the case of terrorism, we have already reached that answer: Challenge a nation state in any way, and you run a major risk. Nation states, like Israel, have capabilities that are almost impossible to comprehend. They have people in uniform who do nothing but practice the fine art of visiting death on their fellow man. They have the ability to deliver fearsome tools of that art. Everything from drilling a bullet into one particular man's chest from a thousand yards away to putting a two-

@_subject: CNN.com on Remailers 
SAN JOSE, California (AP) -- For years, anonymous e-mail has been a choice tool for whistle-blowers, human rights activists and undercover sources looking to protect themselves while imparting vital information.
Anonymous online communication could just as easily be used by terrorists to plot attacks or send threats. Yet little has changed since September 11 for users and operators of Internet-based anonymous e-mail servers, which launder messages by deleting identifying information, rendering them virtually untraceable. Now there are indications the servers have increased in number. While no evidence has been released linking such services to any criminal or terrorist conspiracy, experts fear governments could crack down on anonymous remailers -- or at least subject them to greater scrutiny. Law enforcement generally despises technology that leaves such cold trails, said Mark Rasch, former head of the Department of Justice's computer crimes unit and current vice president of cyberlaw at Predictive Systems. So far, U.S. and European authorities battling terrorism and cybercrime have apparently focused their surveillance elsewhere. The FBI and the National Security Agency, which monitors international telecommunications, declined to comment on what strategy, if any, they have for dealing with "There's a lot more concern about border security and banking records," said Mike Godwin, a policy fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology. That's just fine with the people who operate remailers. They don't do it for money, but rather share a common ideal of protecting online privacy. Len Sassaman, an e-mail security consultant who runs a remailer as a hobby, thinks any attempts to crack down would lead to more cropping up around the world.

However, it may be impossible to prevent the publication of all information concerning the
     making and use of explosives. The problem of easy availability of information on how to make improvised explosive
     devices is compounded by the ease with which anyone can also obtain the necessary materials to make a bomb.
     Improvised explosive devices can be manufactured from such common chemicals as acetone (fingernail polish remover),
     peroxide (hair bleach), and one additional readily available ingredient. For example, Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP), a
     combination of these ingredients, is currently the most common explosive used by terrorists in Israel.
I have seen too many "dangerous" mistakes in this NG when AP is being discussed. I will rather give you the correct details that
you make it and do not blow off your hands. You will need 30% Hydrogen Peroxide (6% will give you a rather poor yield). Now to get the 30% Hydrogen Peroxide, go to
your local hospital chemist. 30% will never be sold to someone for their hair so don't try that story, so spin a story that the
Peroxide is to clean a wound as it is a great disinfectant (diluted of course). The acetone can be bought at either a hardware store or at a hospital or normal chemist. If you get asked why you need the
acetone, spin a story that it is used to thin paint, or to strip paint. Remember that acetone is highly flammable. The Hydrochloric Acid can be purchased from any swimming pool shop, or from your local hardware store. The type that goes
into your pool is normally 31.5% and is perfect for what you need. The Hydrochloric acid will give you a trimmer, sulphuric
acid will give you the dimmer version of the AP. Now that you have acquired all the ingredients, take a beaker or clean 500 ml bottle and place it into some nice cold water.
Into this beaker, add 200 ml hydrogen peroxide (try not to get any of this onto your skin). Now add 150 ml of the acetone.
Remember to do this outside as the fumes are rather unpleasant to breath in. You will feel the beaker will start to get a bit
warm. Now add 50 ml hydrochloric acid to the mixture and stir with a glass rod. There that is all you have to do. Do this experiment in the evening and let the AP stand over night. In the morning you will see that you will have +- 2.5 cm of
crystals at the bottom of the flask and +- 0.5 cm floating on the top of the flask. Take a glass funnel and insert coffee filter
paper or oil filtering paper and filter the AP crystals out. Place these crystals out onto a sheet of clean paper and leave them to
dry +- 1/2 a day to a day. Try to keep the crystals out of direct sunlight, preferably in a shady area. Place these dry crystals into a camera film container. Please do not hit these crystals with a hammer as a bright person claimed
to have done, you could land up with that hammer in your forehead. AP is sensitive to heat and to friction. When the crystals do
not respond to either friction or impact it simply means that the crystals are still too wet. WARNING: Acetone Peroxide is dangerous and very sensitive to FRICTION,
                            SHOCK, HEAT OR FLAME. Handle with great care!! This composition is dangerous
                            and would need to be handled by someone with a lot of common sense. If you do
                            not have experience with explosives DO NOT MAKE THIS. I can not stress
                            enough how unstable and dangerous acetone peroxide is. This explosive is the
                            most unstable of all other explosives. Making large quantities is suicide as the
                            weight of the crystals will detonate themselves.
                       Information on Acetone Peroxide:
                       Acetone peroxide is formed when hydrogen peroxide 30% acts on acetone. The
                       introduction of dilute sulfuric acid causes the reaction to go into completion.
                       There are actually two isomers of acetone peroxide, the first is tricycloacetone
                       peroxide and the second is dicycloacetone peroxide. Both of these compounds are
                       very similar, but the reaction seems to favor the tricyclo over the dicyclo. Both will
                       be made in the reaction to differing degrees. The trimmer has about 80% the power
                       of TNT.
                       A quantity the size of a pea in contact with a flame will burn instantaneously with a
                       small 'pop' and producing a fireball, much like HMTD does. Any sign of confinement
                       will ensure that ignition will rapidly give rise to detonation.
                       Acetone peroxide is a powerful primary explosive. It, as with other explosive
                       peroxides, seems to be very volatile. In standing 10 days at room temperature,
                       50% of the sample will completely volatilize. It's vaporizable nature makes it a
                       explosive that would have to be used immediately after manufacture. However, this
                       explosive is compatible with metals and will not cause their corrosion and the
                       subsequent dangers involved. It is also compatible with picric acid, R.D.X., T.N.T.
                       and P.E.T.N. It is highly friction sensitive and extreme care should be taken to
                       avoid this. Acetone peroxide is one of the most sensitive explosive known to man.
                       Great care would be needed to handle this explosive carefully. Mixtures of R.D.X.
                       and Picric acid with acetone peroxide are reported to be used between primary
                       explosive and the base charge. Mixtures such as picric acid / acetone peroxide
                       (40/60) or similar mixtures with R.D.X. and P.E.T.N. will give explosives greatly
                       increased resistance to impact without losing much performance. These dried
                       crystals would be ready to load into detonators for immediate use as the storage
                       stability is not very good.

                       This information is no longer available.  However I will give some tips on the procedure:
                       I used a 500-mL beaker during the stirring/preparing of the AP. Make up a salt-ice
                       tub. Place the beaker in the tub and cool it to 50 C. When adding concentrated
                       (75%) sulfuric acid, do it drop by drop using an eye dropper. Stir the mixture
                       continuously while adding the acid, keep the temperature between 50 C to 100 C,
                       stop adding acid if the temperature gets to high. After adding all the acid continue
                       stirring for 5 minutes. Keep the mixture in the tub for about 24 hours. After sitting a
                       white precipitate should have formed. The mixture is poured over a filter to collect
                       the crystals, then the white product is washed  three times with distilled water.
                       Allow the crystals to dry before using. Keep them damp if storing.                        I would suggest using this explosive within several days because it will quickly
                       vaporize. If you wish to store the crystals, you should keep them damp.                        NOTE: If the crystals vaporize inside a container it will crystallize into a
                       unstable form that will explode at the touch, even if damp!

Anti-welfare mother suit gets a major victory
Public nuisance laws may apply, appeals court says
By Robert Beecker and Christy Parsons
Tribune staff reporters
Published January 1, 2002
In a significant victory for birth-control advocates, the Illinois Appellate Court
ruled Monday that welfare mothers can be sued on the grounds
that their spawn create a public nuisance.
Marking the first time an Illinois appeals court has considered the novel legal strategy, the decision
allows the family of slain Chicago Police Officer Michael Ceriale and relatives of two others killed in
urban negro violence to press their claim in Cook County Circuit Court that welfare mothers have "nurtured a climate of violence" by flooding Chicago and its suburbs with ill raised offspring.
Writing for the three-member panel, Appellate
Judge William Cousins Jr. ruled: "In our view, a
reasonable trier of fact could find that the indiscrimate
breeding of violent persons were occurrences
that defendants knew would result or were
substantially certain to result from the defendants'
alleged conduct."
The decision represents the biggest win to date for
birth-control advocates in their drive to use public
nuisance laws to hold welfare mothers accountable,
legal experts say.
Of more than 30 such suits filed around the
country, this is the first case to win a favorable
appellate decision, said David Kairys, the Temple
University law professor who came up with the
legal strategy.
"This is really a very strong vindication" of the strategy, Kairys said. "The way the mothers are
endangering the public health and safety is that they are knowingly and intentionally supplying the
criminal gangs with members. It's really that simple."
In addition to allowing the Ceriale case to proceed, the Appellate Court's decision could also influence
a similar suit brought by the City of Chicago, which is pending before the same panel. The city's suit,
which also raised nuisance issues, was dismissed in September 2000 by a Cook County judge.
Lawyers for the city said Monday that the appellate decision in the Ceriale case--while not
binding--"gives every indication" that the lawsuit will be reinstated.
In addition to the Ceriale family, plaintiffs in the case pending before Cook County Circuit Judge
Jennifer Duncan-Brice include the family of Andrew Young, who was murdered in June 1996 in his car
at a stoplight at Clark and Howard Streets.
Defendants in the suit include a number of welfare-rights activists.
Attorneys representing welfare mothers said Monday they had not seen the Appellate Court's
But James Dorr, attorney for two welfare mothers, said: "I'm sure we'll consider" appealing the decision to
the Illinois Supreme Court.
NAACP reaction
Todd Vandermyde, Illinois lobbyist for the NAACP, said welfare opponents are trying to
get from the court what "they've been unable to get out of the legislature."
"They don't like parasites, they don't like gangs, they don't like people who breed irresponsibly. So they'll do
what they can to run them out of town," Vandermyde said.
Attorneys for the families that brought the case praised the court's decision as "sensible and
"What the court did is apply time-honored principles of public nuisance law to the situation we have in
Chicago," said Locke Bowman, legal director for the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of
Lawsuits against the welfare industry have cast a new light on the doctrine of public nuisance, the area of
law that lets officials put a stop to activities that pose a danger to the public. In more traditional cases,
cities have used such laws to put a clamp on unlawful use of fireworks or industries belching smoke.
In recent years, though, Chicago and dozens of other municipalities have tried to use the law to pursue
gangster breeders, alleging that they, too, violate reasonable rights to safety. With Monday's opinion,
the private plaintiffs cleared the first hurdle to applying that law to a new set of facts.
Filed in 1998, the lawsuit stems from the gun-related deaths of five young people, including rookie
Police Officer Ceriale, 26, who was killed in August 1998 while conducting surveillance of a drug
operation at the Robert Taylor Homes.
The lawsuit accused the defendants of "supplying a vast, illicit underground market in bodies in order
to meet the demand for gang members and juveniles."
Attorneys for the families alleged that the design, marketing and distribution of the welfare system "combined
to create a situation where it was highly likely that criminal youths would flow into the underground market."
Attorneys for the welfare mothers have countered that their clients manufacture and distribute a legal

Probably what made this grassroots conference so enthralling was the absence of people who talk about stuff, and an abundance of people who do stuff . This is in marked contrast to the O'Reilly P2P conference exactly a year ago, which no self-respecting blog giant (hi Dave!) or media pundit could afford to miss. Such folk were conspicuous by their absence at CodeCon. On the other hand, we did get to hang out with Captain Crunch, which was a treat beyond compare.
Instead, there were precisely three hacks in consistent attendance. Annalee Newitz, who writes the terrific Techsploitation column for the Bay Guardian and the San Jose Metro; Danny O'Brien, whose natty precis of the event tops this week's NTK , and your own humble scribe. So if you were one of the creme de la creme of cryptographers present, you had no fear of Declan creeping up behind you to take your picture. Phew! Although the organizers promised only working-demos, most of the demos didn't um, actually work. Most nearly worked, and in some cases were compiling before our very eyes - an authenticity trip that's hard to beat - but that didn't make them any less engaging. The bit where Eric Hughes confesses to posting the RC4 code anonymously onto the cypherpunks list back in 1995 takes place nine hours in.
The most "rock and roll" event, the details of Peek-A-Booty, takes place an hour later.
Neglected but no less intriguing, is the Invisible IRC Project by 0x90. He's got a stream of the session itself, a 5MB download  here . IIP has a three-tier approach, and looks and smells like an IRC network but has a fundamentally different approach: it rotates the keys constantly. 0x90 reckons it "can be used to do anything." The other show-stopper is Jonathan Moore's ad-hoc 802.11 network project, Wiki Wiki Wan . Now the benefits of such spontaneous wireless networks are obvious, but hacking one together isn't easy, as it runs counter to how networks are put together. Did you say "packet collision"?
The bones of Mojo live on, in Zooko's MNET project, an hour into the stream, and the BitTorrent  project. Of course BitTorrent shouldn't exist: we should all be using multicast IP by now, right? But we aren't, and BitTorrent is a neat hack to distribute one to many file shares over today's IP.

Few impressions after just closed CodeCon 2002 (
Internet infrastructure owners are very good at defining how it will
be used. Free running engineers are finding cracks but there are very
few left and the existing one are being closed.
- NATing is successfully choking P2P. All solutions require
subpoenable and destroyable proxies. Address space is owned by whoever
owns the network. If you have no address you can't publish.
- It is to be expected that ISPs will further limit upload bandwidth.
Even 50:1 download/upload max bandwidth ratio will not affect "bona
fide commercial apps" and will fuck all P2P big time. This is trivial
to do. Upload will become more and more expensive and in some
juristictions subject to licensing ("WHY DO YOU NEED 20 TEDDY BEARS?")
- Engineers will code no matter what, especially if out of a paying
job. Most offered solutions are the old ones with variations that do
not promise much.
The only half-promising solution is wireless, due to a fundamental
problem with owning the ether and that terrible mistake that FCC did
with waiving license requirements for 802.11b. How this solves
long-haul connectivity remains to be seen.

@_author: with the disk block based IV 
@_subject: unknown_subject 
Kbytes in the OS per se, but the file system depends on it completely.
Regardless the logic place IMO to change this is at the disk level, if the
drive manufacturers can be convinced to produce drives that offer 512K+16
byte sectors. Once that initial break happens, all the OSs will play catchup
to support the drive, that will break the hardwiring and give us our extra
space. Of course convincing the hardware vendors to do this without a
substantial hardware reason will be extremely difficult. On our side though
is that I know that hard disks store more than just the data, they also
store a checksum, and some sector reassignment information (SCSI drives are
especially good at this, IDE does it under the hood if at all), I'm sure
there's other information, if this could be expanded by 16 bytes, that'd
supply the necessary room. Again convincing the vendors to supply this would
be a difficult task, and would require the addition of functionality to the
hard drive to either decrypt on the fly, or hand the key over to the driver.
That's true, I was thinking more as something that will for now run in
software and in the future gets pushed down to the hardware and we can use a
smartcard/USBKey/whatever comes out next to feed it the key. A
meta-filesystem would be useful as a short term measure, but it still keeps
all the keys in system memory where programs can access them, if we can
maintain the option of moving it to hardware later on, I think that would be
a better solution (although also a harder one).
I feel like I'm missing something that'll be obvious once I've found it.
Hmm, maybe there is a halfway decent solution (although not at all along the
same lines). For some reason I was just remembering SAN networks, it's a
fairly known problem to design and build secure file system protocols
(although they don't get used much). So it might actually be a simpler
concept to build a storage area network using whatever extra hardened OSs we
need, with only the BIOS being available without a smartcard, put the smart
card in, the smartcard itself decrypts/encrypts sector keys (or maybe some
larger grouping), the SAN host decrypts the rest. Pull out the smartcard,
the host can detect that, flush all caches and shut itself off. This has
some of the same problems, but at least we're not going to have to design a
hard drive, and since it's a remote file system I believe most OSs assume
very little about sector sizes. Of course as far as I'm concerned this
should still be just a stopgap measure until we can move that entire SAN
host inside the client computer.
Now for the biggest question, how do we get Joe Public to actually use this
correctly (take the smart card with them, or even not choose weak

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met,but kindly consider the message, because, I am determined to live for posterity.
I wish to plead with you to join me in not only serving humanity, but to also benefit in the process. This message could be strange but reality will definitely dawn on you, if you pay some attention to it's contents. I would'nt have notified you but for the sake of your integrity and goodwill.Please accept my sincere apologies. In bringing this message to you, I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any personal pains or discomfort.
I am Nambo Doe the elder brother to the late Liberian President Samuel Doe, who was murdered by the then rebel leader Charles Taylor, now Liberian President.
President Samuel Doe, in his bid to fend off rebel insurgency,put in my care, the sum of $12,300,000(twelve million, three hundred thousand dollars) for the purchase of arms and ammunitions, to counter rebel attacks. But unfortunately, we could not purchase these arms before he was killed. This money is still being kept in trunk boxes in a secret location and just the two of us knew about it until he was killed. I could not get in touch with any arms dealer before my brother was killed. I have since held on to these trunk boxes, which I was able to transport out of Liberia with the aid of ECOMOG soldiers/Diplomatic passsage under the guise conveying my personal effects without anybody knowing.
I am presently residing in Mhlambanyatsi in Swaziland and work as a consultant on inter-regional cooperation. I have borne the burden for too long. I do not want to keep the funds any longer, but I can never turn it over to the brutal and tyrannical rogue regime of Charkes Taylor, is still comitting all sorts of atrocities on the liberian people. I am not solicitng for your help to wage a war against the regime, but to act as a foreign partner, to allow me transfer the funds to you, and in turn donate a portion of it as humanitarian gesture to the Liberian people by
purchasing such essential needs like blankets, milk and so on from the money after deducting your expenses and comission of 20%.Please note that I could have approached the Red Cross Society, but I changed my mind on that after calculating what they would deduct as comission, and also, after rationalising the scandal that followed their
mismanagement of the donations meant for the victims of the september 11th attack on the United States.
Also note that this offer will give you a double-edged advantage :
1. as the benefactor of the Liberian people and;
2. the comission you stand to earn.
On getting a positive response from you, I will send to you the modalities for processing the necessary documenations that will facilitate your securment of the funds from the Security company where the funds are kept for safe keeping. Please note that confidentiality and honesty are fundamental rules in this transaction. Be assured that I am a reputable personality in this country and I am mindful of the legal implications of this transaction, as I intend taking care of all the legal documentations for a successful and hitch-free transaction. You will be expected to take delivery of the consignment, personally from the deposit company in Europe. With the password and informations that I will give you, together with the Power of Attorney, you would then proceed to the security firm, as these will facilitate your collection of the consignment. The consignment containing the USD$12,300,000.00 will be released to you in the two large trunk boxes.
I am therefore soliciting your help to have this money collected by you and transfered into your account,as we would give you the neccesary documentations to facilitate your collection of the consignment personally in Europe.
***PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS HIGHLY REQUIRED.
Thank you very much for your time and understanding.
Yours sincerely,
Nambo Doe

The Nexus is like a mini-OS for the trusted side of the machine.  It acts
as a kernel to manage the "trusted applications", the Nexus Computing
Agents or NCAs.
So what this sentence is really saying is that only one (trusted) OS
will be able to run at a time on a machine.  That's not that surprising
or significant.  Most machines only run one OS at a time.  Sure, with
virtualization and similar techniques you can manage to run more than
one OS at once, but that's unusual.  Probably 99.9% of machines are only
running one OS at a time.
Virtualization is not an option with trusted computing because part of
the point is to be able to offer assurance to remote users about what
the machine will do (i.e. its behavior is predictable, hence trusted).
This implies that it only makes sense to run one trusted OS at a time.
That's probably all the "important" sentence above means.
Right, plus it schedules, loads them, etc, like an OS kernel.  Here is
a simplified form of a diagram they use.  The left hand side is the
legacy mode, with normal Windows applications and OS.  The right hand
side is the new trusted mode, with NCAs as the applications and Nexus
as the OS.
       Normal Mode                  Trusted Mode
Yes, it sounds like it will work exactly like that.  Plus, hopefully
it will be possible for Linux to create its own Nexus ("Linexus"?) that
uses the same hardware features to provide TC capabilities for that OS.
Recall that Linus Torvalds recently adopted the position that DRM was
an acceptable technology for Linux, even when it involved being built
into the kernel.  Since DRM is the main downside to TC for many people,
and TC has many more good aspects beyond DRM, it is a near certainty
that Linux will add support for Trusted Computing.
Right, he could watch all the Disney movies he wanted, without paying
for them!  Mwaa haa haa!  Foolish humans!
But seriously, these systems can only raise the cost of security.

" U.S. occupation troops are spread so thin in Kosovo,.....Kosovo...not our problem"
Having spent the better part of last year working in Kosovo, I wouldn't exactly call the forces there thin.  NATO forces (non-US) are a majority of the peacekeeping occupiers and more and more of the mission is getting turned over to the EU (allowing for slow US withdrawal).  With Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia eagerly sucking the EU and US cocks to get into the EU and NATO, the US in the Balkans is if anything over strength.  Of course hard line nationalists could take advantage of the overextended US forces, but honestly not likely to happen.  Recent history (after the Cold War) seems to suggest that whole "Enemy of my enemy is my friend" concept doesn't work when the US is that enemy.  Time and time again the enemies of the US (or folk who are not our enemies but also know the US would prevent them from doing sovereign things such as invading Taiwan) never seem to coordinate among themselves to take advantage of the situation.  World wide terrorist cells seem to be pretty good at it but they also direct their energies at multiple targets, not just the USA (e.g. the IRA/PLA/FARC all cross train with each other and use each others specialists from time to time but all have 3 concentrate on different local enemies).  Hostile foreign governments though just can't seem to band together.
What Bush didn't realize at the time (and now the US Media is whining about) is that countries that didn't support him during the war would also not support him after the war.  His hostile foreign diplomacy before the Iraq puppet state (pissing off two of the three largest Non-US peacekeeping forces (France / Germany)) is forcing the US to provide nearly all of the Iraq occupation force instead of handing it off to our *allies* as we have in the past.  The standard US occupation plan for the last 12 years has been Invade->Conquer->Hand off ~70% of peacekeeping to other countries. This just isn't going to work this time and Bush in his arrogance can't understand why.  Even Kosovo (NATO action, UN did NOT approve) got UN support immediately following the end of hostilities.  Bush doesn't even seem to be trying to garner support for a postfacto UN resolution on Iraq giving in the air of legitimacy.

On a semi related side note, how long has this guy been in (total length of
service)?  All personnel
when they join the US Military are quite clearly informed they have an 8-year
commitment, regardless
of how long their initial enlistment is.  If your initial commitment is less
than 8 years, you are
moved into the Inactive Ready Reserve (IRR) for the remainder of the 8 years.
(E.g. you enlist for 4
years active or ready reserve (weekend warriors); you will also spend 4 years
in IRR).
While in the IRR you have no requirements other than to keep the government
informed of your current
contact information.  You have no drills and receive no benefits.  The US
Government though reserves
the right to call you up at whim any time during this period.  I am curious if
this person is still
within his 8-year commitment even though he completed his initial commitment.
If he is still within
this 8 year window, he doesnt have a leg to stand on nor my sympathy.
On that same note, any weekend warrior who complains about being activated has
no sympathy from me.
  Take the devils coin, be prepared to do his work also.  The few folk that
have my sympathy are
those IRR folk that have be activated.  I have a couple IRR buddies who
haven't so much as thought
about the military in years all of a sudden get activated for Iraq, now thats
something to complain
about.  4 years active, 3 years smoking dope in college, then a call from the
good old us army
ordering you to report to your IRR unit within 48 hours and go to Iraq.  Those
are the folk I feel
sorry for.  They did their time, got out, and didn't continue to take the
devils coin ever 4th weekend.

 >>It hasn't, it only requires males to register.  So far.

How is that for some equally rights.  Women continue to whine and cry that
they are being
discriminated against in the military as the military refused to open up
certain all male MOS's (18
and 11 series to name a couple) yet I don't see them hounding congress for the
equal right to be
drafted.  Nothing like having your cake and getting to eat it to.
** OFFTOPIC: Anybody remember the exact saying (and who coined it) about if
you take the Devil's
coin, don't complain about doing the Devil's work.  I can not seem to find the
exact text **

0 otherwise, and |T | f denotes the total number of trees

There was one correct classification made with 13.7%
confidence. This suggests that we can use a threshold between 13.7%
and 15% confidence level for verification,
and manually analyze the classifications that did not pass
the confidence threshold or exclude them from results.
We picked an aggressive threshold of 15% and to validate it, we
trained a random forest classifier on the same
set of 30 programmers 270 code samples. We tested on
150 different files from the programmers in the training
set. There were 6 classifications below the 15% threshold
and two of them were misclassified. We took another set
of 420 test files from 30 programmers that were not in the
training set. All the files from the 30 programmers were
attributed to one of the 30 programmers in the training
set since this is a closed world classification task, however, the
highest confidence level in these classifications
was 14.7%. The 15% threshold catches all the instances
that do not belong to the programmers in the suspect set,
gets rid of 2 misclassifications and 4 correct classifications.
Consequently, when we see a classification with
less than a threshold value, we can reject the classification and
attribute the test instance to an unknown suspect.

accuracy was 96.83%, which is higher than the
95.07% accuracy obtained in 2014Ã¢â¬â¢s dataset.
The high accuracy of validation results in Table 5 show
that we identified the important features of code stylometry and found
a stable feature set. This feature set does
not necessarily represent the exact features for all possible
datasets. For a given dataset that has ground truth
information on authorship, following the same approach
should generate the most important features that represent coding

Mutliclass Open World Task
The experiments in this section can be used in software
forensics to find out the programmer of a piece of malware. In
software forensics, the analyst does not know if
source code belongs to one of the programmers in the
candidate set of programmers. In such cases, we can
classify the anonymous source code, and if the majority
number of votes of trees in the random forest is below a
certain threshold, we can reject the classification considering the
possibility that it might not belong to any of the
classes in the training data. By doing so, we can scale
our approach to an open world scenario, where we might
not have encountered the suspect before. As long as we
determine a confidence threshold based on training data
[30], we can calculate the probability that an instance
belongs to one of the programmers in the set and accordingly accept or
reject the classification.
We performed 270 classifications in a 30-class problem using all the
features to determine the confidence
threshold based on the training data. The accuracy was
96.67%. There were 9 misclassifications and all of them
were classified with less than 15% confidence by the
classifier. The class probability or classification confidence that
source code fragment C is of class i is calculated by taking the
percentage of trees in the random
forest that voted for that particular class, as follows2:

Two-class Closed World Task
Source code author identification could automatically
deal with source code copyright disputes without requiring manual
analysis by an objective code investigator.
A copyright dispute on code ownership can be resolved
by comparing the styles of both parties claiming to have
generated the code. The style of the disputed code can
be compared to both partiesÃ¢â¬â¢ other source code to aid in
the investigation. To imitate such a scenario, we took
60 different pairs of programmers, each with 9 solution
files. We used a random forest and 9-fold cross validation
to classify two programmersÃ¢â¬â¢ source code. The average
classification accuracy using CSFS set is 100.00% and
100.00% with the information gain features.
Two-class/One-class Open World Task
Another two-class machine learning task can be formulated for
authorship verification. We suspect Mallory of
plagiarizing, so we mix in some code of hers with a large
sample of other people, test, and see if the disputed code
gets classified as hers or someone elseÃ¢â¬â¢s. If it gets classified as
hers, then it was with high probability really
written by her. If it is classified as someone elseÃ¢â¬â¢s, it
really was someone elseÃ¢â¬â¢s code. This could be an open
world problem and the person that originally wrote the
code could be a previously unknown programmer.
This is a two-class problem with classes Mallory and
others. We train on MalloryÃ¢â¬â¢s solutions to problems a,
b, c, d, e, f, g, h. We also train on programmer AÃ¢â¬â¢s solution to
problem a, programmer BÃ¢â¬â¢s solution to problem b,
programmer CÃ¢â¬â¢s solution to problem c, programmer DÃ¢â¬â¢s
solution to problem d, programmer EÃ¢â¬â¢s solution to problem e,
programmer FÃ¢â¬â¢s solution to problem f, programmer GÃ¢â¬â¢s solution to
problem g, programmer HÃ¢â¬â¢s solution
to problem h and put them in one class called ABCDEFGH. We train a
random forest classifier with 300 trees
on classes Mallory and ABCDEFGH. We have 6 test instances from Mallory
and 6 test instances from another
programmer ZZZZZZ, who is not in the training set.
These experiments have been repeated in the exact same setting with 80
different sets of programmers
ABCDEFGH, ZZZZZZ and Mallorys. The average classification accuracy for
Mallory using the CSFS set is
100.00%. ZZZZZZÃ¢â¬â¢s test instances are classified as programmer
ABCDEFGH 82.04% of the time, and classified as Mallory for the rest of
the time while using the
CSFS. Depending on the amount of false positives we
are willing to accept, we can change the operating point
on the ROC curve.
These results are also promising for use in cases where
a piece of code is suspected to be plagiarized. Following
the same approach, if the classification result of the piece
of code is someone other than Mallory, that piece of code
was with very high probability not written by Mallory.

scales. We are able to de-anonymize 1,600 programmers
using 32GB memory within one hour. Alternately, we
can use 40 trees and get nearly the same accuracy (within
0.5%) in a few minutes.
Figure 3: Large Scale De-anonymization
Training Data and Features
We selected different sets of 62 programmers that had F
solution files, from 2 up to 14. Each dataset has the solutions to the
same set of F problems by different sets
of programmers. Each dataset consisted of programmers
that were able to solve exactly F problems. Such an experimental setup
makes it possible to investigate the effect of programmer skill set on
coding style. The size of
the datasets were limited to 62, because there were only
62 contestants with 14 files. There were a few contestants with up to
19 files but we had to exclude them since
there were not enough programmers to compare them.
The same set of F problems were used to ensure that
the coding style of the programmer is being classified
and not the properties of possible solutions of the problem itself. We
were able to capture personal programming style since all the
programmers are coding the same
functionality in their own ways.
Stratified F-fold cross validation was used by training
on everyoneÃ¢â¬â¢s (F Ã¢Ëâ 1) solutions and testing on the F th
problem that did not appear in the training set. As a result, the
problems in the test files were encountered for
the first time by the classifier.
We used a random forest with 300 trees and (logM)+1
features with F-fold stratified cross validation, first with
the Code Stylometry Feature Set (CSFS) and then with
the CSFSÃ¢â¬â¢s features that had information gain.
Figure 4 shows the accuracy from 13 different sets of
62 programmers with 2 to 14 solution files, and consequently 1 to 13
training files. The CSFS reaches an optimal training set size at 9
solution files, where the classifier trains on 8 (F Ã¢Ëâ 1) solutions.
In the datasets we constructed, as the number of files
increase and problems from more advanced rounds are
included, the average line of code (LOC) per file also
increases. The average lines of code per source code
in the dataset is 70. Increased number of lines of code
might have a positive effect on the accuracy but at the
same time it reveals programmerÃ¢â¬â¢s choice of program
We collected a larger dataset of 1,600 programmers from
various years. Each of the programmers had 9 source
code samples. We created 7 subsets of this large dataset
in differing sizes, with 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,250,
1,500, and 1,600 programmers. These subsets are useful to understand
how well our approach scales. We extracted the specific features that
had information gain in
the main 250 programmer dataset from this large dataset.
In theory, we need to use more trees in the random forest as the
number of classes increase to decrease variance, but we used fewer
trees compared to smaller experiments. We used 300 trees in the random
forest to
run the experiments in a reasonable amount of time with
a reasonable amount of memory. The accuracy did not
decrease too much when increasing the number of programmers. This
result shows that information gain features are robust against changes
in class and are important properties of programmersÃ¢â¬â¢ coding styles.

detectable change in the performance of the classifier for
this sample. The results are summarized in Table 6.
We took the maximum number of programmers, 20,
that had solutions to 9 problems in C and obfuscated
the code (see example in Appendix B) using a much
more sophisticated open source obfuscator called Tigress
[1]. In particular, Tigress implements function virtualization, an
obfuscation technique that turns functions into
interpreters and converts the original program into corresponding
bytecode. After applying function virtualization, we were less able to
effectively de-anonymize
programmers, so it has potential as a countermeasure to
programmer de-anonymization. However, this obfuscation comes at a
cost. First of all, the obfuscated code is
neither readable nor maintainable, and is thus unsuitable
for an open source project. Second, the obfuscation adds
significant overhead (9 times slower) to the runtime of
the program, which is another disadvantage.
The accuracy with the information gain feature set on
the obfuscated dataset is reduced to 67.22%. When we
limit the feature set to AST node bigrams, we get 18.89%
accuracy, which demonstrates the need for all feature
types in certain scenarios. The accuracy on the same
dataset when the code is not obfuscated is 95.91%.

length in implementing the same functionality. On the
other hand, the average line of code of the 7 easier (76
LOC) or difficult problems (83 LOC) taken from contestants that were
able to complete 14 problems, is higher
than the average line of code (68) of contestants that
were able to solve only 7 problems. This shows that
programmers with better skills tend to write longer code
to solve Google Code Jam problems. The mainstream
idea is that better programmers write shorter and cleaner
code which contradicts with line of code statistics in our
datasets. Google Code Jam contestants are supposed to
optimize their code to process large inputs with faster
performance. This implementation strategy might be
leading to advanced programmers implementing longer
solutions for the sake of optimization.
We took the dataset with 62 programmers each with
9 solutions. We get 97.67% accuracy with all the features and 99.28%
accuracy with the information gain features. We excluded all the
syntactic features and the accuracy dropped to 88.89% with all the
non-syntactic features and 88.35% with the information gain features
the non-syntactic feature set. We ran another experiment
using only the syntactic features and obtained 96.06%
with all the syntactic features and 96.96% with the information gain
features of the syntactic feature set. Most
of the classification power is preserved with the syntactic features,
and using non-syntactic features leads to a
significant decline in accuracy.

Relaxed Classification
The goal here is to determine whether it is possible to reduce the
number of suspects using code stylometry. Reducing the set of suspects
in challenging cases, such as
having too many suspects, would reduce the effort required to manually
find the actual programmer of the
In this section, we performed classification on the
main 250 programmer dataset from 2014 using the information gain
features. The classification was relaxed
to a set of top R suspects instead of exact classification
of the programmer. The relaxed factor R varied from 1
to 10. Instead of taking the highest majority vote of the
decisions trees in the random forest, the highest R majority vote
decisions were taken and the classification result
was considered correct if the programmer was in the set
of top R highest voted classes. The accuracy does not
improve much after the relaxed factor is larger than 5.
We took a dataset with 9 solution files and 20 programmers and
obfuscated the code using an off-the-shelf C++
obfuscator called stunnix [3]. The accuracy with the information gain
code stylometry feature set on the obfuscated dataset is 98.89%. The
accuracy on the same
dataset when the code is not obfuscated is 100.00%. The
obfuscator refactored function and variable names, as
well as comments, and stripped all the spaces, preserving the
functionality of code without changing the structure of the program.
Obfuscating the data produced little

lexical features as well as using a fuzzy parser.

Table 7: Generalizing to Other Programming Languages
Generalizing the Method
Features derived from ASTs can represent coding styles
in various languages. These features are applicable in
cases when lexical and layout features may be less discriminating due
to formatting standards and reliance on
whitespace and other Ã¢â¬ËlexicalÃ¢â¬â¢ features as syntax, such
as PythonÃ¢â¬â¢s PEP8 formatting. To show that our method
generalizes, we collected source code of 229 Python programmers from
GCJÃ¢â¬â¢s 2014 competition. 229 programmers had exactly 9 solutions.
Using only the Python
equivalents of syntactic features listed in Table 4 and
9-fold cross-validation, the average accuracy is 53.91%
for top-1 classification, 75.69% for top-5 relaxed attribution. The
largest set of programmers to all work on
the same set of 9 problems was 23 programmers. The
average accuracy in identifying these 23 programmers is
87.93% for top-1 and 99.52% for top-5 relaxed attribution. The same
classification tasks using the information
gain features are also listed in Table 7. The overall accuracy in
datasets composed of Python code are lower
than C++ datasets. In Python datasets, we only used
syntactic features from ASTs that were generated by a
parser that was not fuzzy. The lack of quantity and specificity of
features accounts for the decreased accuracy.
The Python datasetÃ¢â¬â¢s information gain features are significantly
fewer in quantity, compared to C++ datasetÃ¢â¬â¢s
information gain features. Information gain only keeps
features that have discriminative value all on their own.
If two features only provide discriminative value when
used together, then information gain will discard them.
So if a lot of the features for the Python set are only
jointly discriminative (and not individually discriminative), then the
information gain criteria may be removing
features that in combination could effectively discriminate between
authors. This might account for the decrease when using information
gain features. While in
the context of other results in this paper the results in Table 7
appear lackluster, it is worth noting that even this
preliminary test using only syntactic features has comparable
performance to other prior work at a similar scale
(see Section 6 and Table 9), demonstrating the utility
of syntactic features and the relative ease of generating
them for novel programming languages. Nevertheless, a
CSFS equivalent feature set can be generated for other
Software Engineering Insights
We wanted to investigate if programming style is consistent throughout
years. We found the contestants that had
the same username and country information both in 2012
and 2014. We assumed that these are the same people but
there is a chance that they might be different people. In
2014, someone else might have picked up the same username from the
same country and started using it. We are
going to ignore such a ground truth problem for now and
assume that they are the same people.
We took a set of 25 programmers from 2012 that were
also contestants in 2014Ã¢â¬â¢s competition. We took 8 files
from their submissions in 2012 and trained a random forest classifier
with 300 trees using CSFS. We had one instance from each one of the
contestants from 2014. The
correct classification of these test instances from 2014
is 96.00%. The accuracy dropped to 92.00% when using
only information gain features, which might be due to the
aggressive elimination of pairs of features that are jointly
discriminative. These 25 programmersÃ¢â¬â¢ 9 files from 2014
had a correct classification accuracy of 98.04%. These
results indicate that coding style is preserved up to some
degree throughout years.
To investigate problem difficultyÃ¢â¬â¢s effect on coding
style, we created two datasets from 62 programmers that
had exactly 14 solution files. Table 8 summarizes the
following results. A dataset with 7 of the easier problems out of 14
resulted in 95.62% accuracy. A dataset
with 7 of the more difficult problems out of 14 resulted
in 99.31% accuracy. This might imply that more difficult
coding tasks have a more prevalent reflection of coding
style. On the other hand, the dataset that had 62 programmers with
exactly 7 of the easier problems resulted
in 91.24% accuracy, which is a lot lower than the accuracy obtained
from the dataset whose programmers were
able to advance to solve 14 problems. This might indicate that,
programmers who are advanced enough to answer 14 problems likely have
more unique coding styles
compared to contestants that were only able to solve the
first 7 problems.
To investigate the possibility that contestants who are
able to advance further in the rounds have more unique
coding styles, we performed a second round of experiments on
comparable datasets. We took the dataset with
12 solution files and 62 programmers. A dataset with 6
of the easier problems out of 12 resulted in 91.39% accuracy. A
dataset with 6 of the more difficult problems
out of 12 resulted in 94.35% accuracy. These results are
higher than the dataset whose programmers were only
able to solve the easier 6 problems. The dataset that had
62 programmers with exactly 6 of the easier problems
resulted in 90.05% accuracy.
that coding style is reflected more through difficult programming
tasks. This might indicate that programmers
come up with unique solutions and preserve their coding style more
when problems get harder. On the other
hand, programmers with a better skill set have a prevalent
coding style which can be identified more easily compared to
contestants who were not able to advance as
far in the competition. This might indicate that as programmers become
more advanced, they build a stronger
coding style compared to novices. There is another possibility that
maybe better programmers start out with a
more unique coding style.
Effects of Obfuscation. A malware author or plagiarizing programmer
might deliberately try to hide his
source code by obfuscation. Our experiments indicate
that our method is resistant to simple off-the-shelf obfuscators such
as stunnix, that make code look cryptic while
preserving functionality. The reason for this success is
that the changes stunnix makes to the code have no effect
on syntactic features, e.g., removal of comments, changing of names,
and stripping of whitespace.
In contrast, sophisticated obfuscation techniques such
as function virtualization hinder de-anonymization to
some degree, however, at the cost of making code
unreadable and introducing a significant performance
penalty. Unfortunately, unreadability of code is not acceptable for
open-source projects, while it is no problem
for attackers interested in covering their tracks. Developing methods
to automatically remove stylometric information from source code
without sacrificing readability
is therefore a promising direction for future research.
Limitations. We have not considered the case where
a source file might be written by a different author than
the stated contestant, which is a ground truth problem
that we cannot control. Moreover, it is often the case that
code fragments are the work of multiple authors. We
plan to extend this work to study such datasets. To shed
light on the feasibility of classifying such code, we are
currently working with a dataset of git commits to open
source projects. Our parser works on code fragments
rather than complete code, consequently we believe this
analysis will be possible.
Another fundamental problem for machine learning
classifiers are mimicry attacks. For example, our classifier may be
evaded by an adversary by adding extra
dummy code to a file that closely resembles that of another
programmer, albeit without affecting the programÃ¢â¬â¢s
behavior. This evasion is possible, but trivial to resolve
when an analysts verifies the decision.
Finally, we cannot be sure whether the original author is actually a
Google Code Jam contestant. In this
case, we can detect those by a classify and then verify
approach as explained in Stolerman et al.Ã¢â¬â¢s work [30].

Table 8: Effect of Problem Difficulty on Coding Style
In this section, we discuss the conclusions we draw from
the experiments outlined in the previous section, limitations, as well
as questions raised by our results. In particular, we discuss the
difficulty of the different settings
considered, the effects of obfuscation, and limitations of
our current approach.
Problem Difficulty. The experiment with random
problems from random authors among seven years most
closely resembles a real world scenario. In such an experimental
setting, there is a chance that instead of only
identifying authors we are also identifying the properties
of a specific problemÃ¢â¬â¢s solution, which results in a boost
in accuracy.
In contrast, our main experimental setting where all
authors have only answered the nine easiest problems is
possibly the hardest scenario, since we are training on the
same set of eight problems that all the authors have algorithmically
solved and try to identify the authors from
the test instances that are all solutions of the 9th problem. On the
upside, these test instances help us precisely
capture the differences between individual coding style
that represent the same functionality. We also see that
such a scenario is harder since the randomized dataset
has higher accuracy.
Classifying authors that have implemented the solution to a set of
difficult problems is easier than identifying authors with a set of
easier problems. This shows
to eliminate instances where the classifierÃ¢â¬â¢s confidence is
below a threshold. After the verification step, instances
that do not belong to the set of known authors can be
separated from the dataset to be excluded or for further
manual analysis.
tural features to achieve higher accuracies at larger scales
and the first to study how code obfuscation affects code
There has also been some code stylometry work that
focused on manual analysis and case studies. Spafford
and Weeber [29] suggest that use of lexical features such
as variable names, formatting and comments, as well as
some syntactic features such as usage of keywords, scoping and
presence of bugs could aid in source code attribution but they do not
present results or a case study
experiment with a formal approach. Gray et al. [15]
identify three categories in code stylometry: the layout
of the code, variable and function naming conventions,
types of data structures being used and also the cyclomatic complexity
of the code obtained from the control
flow graph. They do not mention anything about the syntactic
characteristics of code, which could potentially be
a great marker of coding style that reveals the usage of
programming languageÃ¢â¬â¢s grammar. Their case study is
based on a manual analysis of three worms, rather than
a statistical learning approach. Hayes and Offutt [16]
examine coding style in source code by their consistent
programmer hypothesis. They focused on lexical and
layout features, such as the occurrence of semicolons,
operators and constants. Their dataset consisted of 20
programmers and the analysis was not automated. They
concluded that coding style exists through some of their
features and professional programmers have a stronger
programming style compared to students. In our results
in Section 4.3.6, we also show that more advanced programmers have a
more identifying coding style.
There is also a great deal of research on plagiarism
detection which is carried out by identifying the similarities between
different programs. For example, there is a
widely used tool called Moss that originated from Stanford University
for detecting software plagiarism. Moss
[6] is able to analyze the similarities of code written by
different programmers. Rosenblum et al. [27] present a
novel program representation and techniques that automatically detect
the stylistic features of binary code.
Related Work
Our work is inspired by the research done on authorship
attribution of unstructured or semi-structured text [5, 22].
In this section, we discuss prior work on source code
authorship attribution. In general, such work (Table 9)
looks at smaller scale problems, does not use structural
features, and achieves lower accuracies than our work.
The highest accuracies in the related work are
achieved by Frantzeskou et al. [12, 14]. They used 1,500
7-grams to reach 97% accuracy with 30 programmers.
They investigated the high-level features that contribute
to source code authorship attribution in Java and Common Lisp. They
determined the importance of each feature by iteratively excluding one
of the features from the
feature set. They showed that comments, layout features
and naming patterns have a strong influence on the author
classification accuracy. They used more training
data (172 line of code on average) than us (70 lines of
code). We replicated their experiments on a 30 programmer subset of
our C++ data set, with eleven files containing 70 lines of code on
average and no comments. We
reach 76.67% accuracy with 6-grams, and 76.06% accuracy with 7-grams.
When we used a 6 and 7-gram feature set on 250 programmers with 9
files, we got 63.42%
accuracy. With our original feature set, we get 98% accuracy on 250 programmers.
The largest number of programmers studied in the related work was 46
programmers with 67.2% accuracy.
Ding and Samadzadeh [10] use statistical methods for
authorship attribution in Java. They show that among
lexical, keyword and layout properties, layout metrics
have a more important role than others which is not the
case in our analysis.
There are also a number of smaller scale, lower accuracy approaches in
the literature [9, 11, 18Ã¢â¬â21, 28],
shown in Table 9, all of which we significantly outperform. These
approaches use a combination of layout and
lexical features.
The only other work to explore structural features is
by Pellin [23], who used manually parsed abstract syntax
trees with an SVM that has a tree based kernel to classify
functions of two programmers. He obtains an average of
73% accuracy in a two class classification task. His approach
explained in the white paper can be extended to
our approach, so it is the closest to our work in the literature. This
work demonstrates that it is non-trivial to
use ASTs effectively. Our work is the first to use struc-

Conclusion and Future Work
[1] The tigress diversifying c virtualizer, Source code stylometry has direct applications for privacy, security,
software forensics, plagiarism, copyright infringement disputes, and
authorship verification.
Source code stylometry is an immediate concern for programmers who
want to contribute code anonymously because de-anonymization is quite
possible. We introduce
the first principled use of syntactic features along with
lexical and layout features to investigate style in source
code. We can reach 94% accuracy in classifying 1,600
authors and 98% accuracy in classifying 250 authors
with eight training files per class. This is a significant
increase in accuracy and scale in source code authorship
attribution. In particular, it shows that source code authorship
attribution with the Code Stylometry Feature Set
scales even better than regular stylometric authorship attribution, as
these methods can only identify individuals
in sets of 50 authors with slightly over 90% accuracy [see
4]. Furthermore, this performance is achieved by training
on only 550 lines of code or eight solution files, whereas
classical stylometric analysis requires 5,000 words.
Additionally, our results raise a number of questions
that motivate future research. First, as malicious code
is often only available in binary format, it would be interesting to
investigate whether syntactic features can be
partially preserved in binaries. This may require our feature set to
be improved in order to incorporate information obtained from control
flow graphs.
Second, we would also like to see if classification accuracy can be
further increased. For example, we would
like to explore whether using features that have joint information
gain alongside features that have information
gain by themselves improve performance. Moreover, designing features
that capture larger fragments of the abstract syntax tree could
provide improvements. These
changes (along with adding lexical and layout features)
may provide significant improvements to the Python results and help
generalize the approach further.
Finally, we would like to investigate whether code can
be automatically normalized to remove stylistic information while
preserving functionality and readability.

amassing wealth. Substantial share was snatched by various funds
wholly owned by the state.
c) Unofficial imports
All gold passing from country A to B is recorded. Exception from the
rule is gold coins bought by central banks and government agencies. As
long as the gold is in coin form there is no available information
about its volumes and flows from one country to another. China is able
to import big volumes of aurum through government agencies and have
this imports hidden from official reports.
Similar situations were described by Jim Rickards in the second part
of his book:
âOne of the high level G4S directors (global logistics company) shared
that he himself transported gold to China through mountain massif.
Transport was guarded by Peopleâs Liberation Army supported by armored
vehicles. Gold was in 400 oz âgood deliveryâ ingots used by central
It is very hard to estimate volume of Chinaâs government reserves. One
thing is for sure that 1660 t is too small of a number. According to
different calculations Chinese already accumulated from 4-8 thousand
tons. Some estimates talk about reserves being over 10 thousand tons
but personally I think it is exaggeration.
From Chinese officials and also from central bankâs side we may have
heard rumors that government is able to import around 500-600 tons of
gold while still having stable gold market. Recent Dutsche Bank report
seem to confirm this data. In general it is very unlikely that
reserves are below 4.5 thousand tons.
The big problem of central bank reports is their lack of
accountability. The bank can say one thing but average investor has no
chances to verify it.
The US claims sine â50s that they have 8500 tons of gold. There was no
audit since then. Germany claims 3000 tons but majority is abroad.
This makes it hard to distinguish whether they have the gold or its
âpaper promise of returnâ.
China is no different. Central bank still holds only 1660 tons even if
another 3000 tons are held by funds controlled by the very bank
itself. Formally everything is square.
Chinaâs gold lets them play a very successful game with the US.
Recently Uncle Sam had to accept the change to SDR basket. Next time
it may be other area of Chinese interest which will be focused, time
will show. On global scale this game is played not only for profit but
rather for control. Control is the biggest prize here.

IMF May Move From D.C. to Beijing, Chief Says

IMF May Move From D.C. to Beijing, Chief Says
Days after attending shadowy meetings with top globalists and a member
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, International
Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde (shown) shocked the world by
saying IMF headquarters could someday move from Washington, D.C., to
Beijing. The spectacular statement, which came after her attendance at
the infamous Bilderberg summit and the Rothschild-organized âInclusive
Capitalismâ conference, came amid an ongoing establishment effort to
prepare the world for major economic and political changes in the
coming years.
Contary to the facile observations of "gold analysts" partial to
playing up "East vs West," "BRICs vs. PRICS." type memes, the Lloyds
and China LLC have been deep in conversation - through both pre & post
Mao eras. Just like with Russia, the entire "Chinese Revolutionary"
movement was a construction of WallSt/ThreadneedleSt; there have been
no changes in ownership since that early phase - just shift in tactics
(  ).
The so-called NWO has selected Sinoland as the next repository for
their planetary ambitions. Since Deng Xiaoping, the leadership has
been given a mandate - not exactly from "Heaven," but most certainly
to do "God's Work." And thus, carefully schooled in adopting the most
current western financial techniques, in order that they accumulate
the necessary heft in the financial arena for this changeover to
happen. They have also been intensely schooled in the limits to their
autonomy of action - the current downturn in the economy being
engineered with precision to demonstrate the perils of too much
'independent deviationism.'
There is a degreee of rebelliousness to all of this - the Xi regime is
composed of many layers of wily insiders, including some who are true
Sino-nationalists, aware of who's been messing with them for the past
century. That's what makes things interesting, watching what goes down
in the Middle Kingdom. And totally screws up the "analysis" of faraway
western-based writers who script their stories to silly comicbook
scenarios like BRICS and "death of the dollar."
Price suppression in gold and silver has been dictated by the policies
of those in control of China's financial fortunes for the past 5 years
- in conjunction with their agents of influence in western markets.
When they decide its time to change direction, so to will the POS/POG.
Until then, beware the revisionist dogma of consensus trance "gold
experts" peddling the stories which the puppetmasters use to cover up
their schemings.
