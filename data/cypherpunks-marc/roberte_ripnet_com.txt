Its my premiss that people are extrodinarily clever at making things fit.
We do see that individual pairs of people can find a bridge to even between radically different world view.
We just have never found a way to generalise such mutual understandings.

Not saying the path is accessable, but as long as we are unable to free ourselves from ideology,
whats wrong with one that builds on our best?

The secular bible: Our project
First let me speak to my Christian brothers and sisters. I mean you no
disrespect by using the term "bible" in an unholy attack on your faith.
The project of this secular bible honors the sanctity of holy documents.
A secular bible could only be true to itself is it stood for tolerance
and cooperation.
We all know of the worldwide spread of dissatisfaction and unhappiness.
We acknowledge the existence of what we can only call "evil" in the world.
We have less agreement on what we call "good" or "godlike"  We have not
found enough agreement on what to do about evil.
There are those among us who hold to the principle no agreement is
required. The proper agents in the war against chaos are the free and
independent thinkers of the mythical open society. The radical edge of
this stance is the notion that cooperation always entails disaster in
the form of unintended consequences.
There are those among us who are afraid of the unknown. Many of us
prefer to keep to the familiar. We find ourselves in circles of friends
and relatives and find comfort or at least solace in the company of
these others. We become "us".
There is a subtle danger in this. The formation of community is also the
formation of "them"
There are those among us who fear "them" so much that the very thought
of cooperation is scary. To them the idea that there could be a science
of cooperation is absurd. They will cite economics and rational self
interest to avoid gambling on trust. The run-away paranoia that can
ensue will tax their freedom as surely as the state must.
The project of the science of understanding, this secular bible giving
people an understanding of their part in the universe, and the tools
they need to get along with all manner of thinkers.
Of course this is all meant sarcastically.
The Lord knows, nobody wants to just get along.

@_subject: Nul Context 
Communication is about context
Sometimes the context is so obvious that the frame is nearly invisible,
sometimes the context is so subtle that indications of obvious
significance can only be detected after much study.
Language and meaning involve sharing of contexts.
This is obvious, what is less obvious is the way that communication
implicates a context one might call, A Theory of Mind
What does this mean? Well a lot of it is hidden in what we call common
sense, or folk psychology. You know what I mean because I'm behaving
conventionally in my choice of words, and saying stuff that makes sense.
When we use language conventionally, we talk about things that are
happening and what people are thinking. When we talk about things that
matter we wonder what others think. We think about what other people are
thinking, all the time.
Its a common enough usage of language, and quite comprehensible. Which
makes it all the more peculiar that for a long time science had a weird
rule that said that unempirical terms like intention and purpose, not to
mention perception and comprehension were "metaphysical nonsense".
Science has come a long way since the logical positivists held sway. Its
not that they were wrong, the problem was they couldnt be right. The
original proof that they were wrong was at hand for most of the 20th
century, in the interference pattern between the works of Wittgenstein
and Gödel,
As recently as the middle of the last century, back when Chomsky was
doing his seminal work in deep structures, psychology was firmly stuck
with Pavlovian Reflexes and Skinner Boxes and vigorously opposed
adopting any working theory of mind. Stimulus Response Theory just cant
handle task of explaining what an artist does. Into this context, Modern
Linguistics was born.

What can society do about these people who think that they know something?
Well, first we deny the possibility that they have anything novel to
say, then we arrange to have them find fault with themselves for what
they perceive as their own shortcomings. Then after they have injured
themselves trying to correct this implied deficiency, we tell them that
maybe their ideas had merit, but the only efficient way to assess any
idea, is for the originator to take responsibility for making them
happen. If they are unable to demonstrate the successful application of
the idea, we take this as proof that the idea was no good to begin with.
Such is the application of market theory to the systematic suppression
of unsupported ideas. The attitudes of Winners and Losers alike, are
taken to be the causative factor. We recognize the effect of the self
fulfilling prophesy. In both cases what is going unmentioned is the
structural context. Winners are those we give credit to, Losers face
responsibility for not being creditable. Winners will credit their
success to luck and hard work, but Losers are left to reach the
conclusion that either it is all their personal fault, or they have been
the victim of bad luck.
What to do about the illusion of functional autonomy vs. the principle
of independence?
Self control: we must become sufficiently self aware to realize that
this vital instrument of independence is exactly the force that
imprisons so many of us within a personal hell. As a society we would be
well advised to examine the structural realities that leave so many of
us with broken dreams and a poverty of options. The merit principle is
all very well, but is'nt it is a clear sign of a sick society, when we
conflate winning the lottery, with demonstrating competence?

Sometimes when people get to using fancy words, they forget the difference. Between you and me - we'll speak plainly - the country needs more clarity, 'cause we cant afford to forget what matters.
We may not agree on much, but I'm certain that you really do see how there's stuff that matters. I respect you for this. No doubt we can agree that it's frustrating at times, to talk with smart asses who lack this common sense.

Process and perception
This capacity for making high order discriminations about relationships
between objects in our world, can be taken as the proper function of our
cognitive competency. The attribute of intentionality, to this way of
thinking, is best understood as "work product" of a discrete sub-module
of our brain.
We infer agency from our observations. What is agency? Well first and
foremost, it is that which is recognizable to the competencies in
process, that form these judgments.
Does this sound circular? Surely it is circular in a crucial sense. All
that we "know" comes to our attention as the work product of process in
various competencies. Ultimately the "authority" of  these high order
discriminations comes not from a judgment about the correlation between
our perceptions and the state of the "objective" world, but instead from
their immediacy. This is to say that we do not perceive and then make
judgments, our first awareness of every "thing"  is located in the
moment that the competent module forms some thing out of the possibilities.
These awareness's are not in the semantic domain. Our knowing of
particular attributes precedes the semantic transform that tags and
packages up insights, for storage and shipping. We know what we know and
we apologize for not being able to convey this knowing more effectively.
That we are able to communicate at all, is a testament to the power of
trial and error and the phenomenal similarity of our minds. This
similarity is not accidental. Even as each person is an absolutely
unique instance of humanity, what we are, is the embodiment of a
phenomenally complex tangle of historical accomplishments that is
fundamentally common to us all.
Creativity emerges via the capacity/ability to merge contexts
Biological instrumentality:
The complex objects of our knowings come to our awareness as
circumstances demand, literally selected by their features. Apprehension
of the world via a sophisticatedly evolved biological instrumentality is
an entropy hack. Life is the opportunistic bloom of a viral exploitation
of regularity in the universe.
In the beginning there was sequence, and it begat pattern and context
space. Within every context space there is a tree of combinatorial
consequences some leaves of which are potentially lucky. Blind evolution
isn't trial and error testing of mistakes (mutations), it is the random
testing of legal combinations
So who set up the game, where did the rules come from, and the design
The dynamic core of our consciousness consists of transient alignments
of Feature Value - Action loops that compete for selection in a
flicker-dance-sort of associations and sensory stimuli.
Perception is a physics hack. Timing is everything. Three dimensionality
is accessible to us via  a cross mapping within the temporal manifold.
Propagation of coherent correlations between map-mapped sheets of
neurons act as a massively parallel delay line with multiple taps.
Because both spatial and temporal coherence is preserved, the network
sorts up the objects of perception and tracks them real time. Reality is
best fit. Misperceptions happen, but its better than being blind.
Our competency at this is not postulated, it is stipulated that the high
order discriminations we perceive as qualia are exactly as amazing as
the incredible complexity of the neurological stack that gives us them.
Intentionality is an emergent design goal in secondary consciousness.
(before getting upset about intentional language, remember that it works
because reality fits.)
Phenomenal transform is a semantic label for a context shift. If you
insist on thinking of it as a happening, what's happening is that we
find ourselves switching lexicons when we discuss certain things. Its
not a description of a change of state in the object, it is a handle for
referring to a pragmatic feature of discourse about it.
The important thing to realize is that this sorting out of the features
of the objects of our perception usually is done before we are aware of
the process, but this does not mean that the process is different for
hard discriminations, just that they are taking longer than the ~400ms
self context loop, that feeds a product of the net's immediate state
back into itself. Think convolving and converging. Discrimination occurs
opportunistically, our competencies do not require conscious attention.
In the formation of PV Action loops each project become one of the

cognitive competency. The attribute of intentionality, to this way of
thinking, is best understood as "work product" of a discrete sub-module
of our brain.
We infer agency from our observations. What is agency? Well first and
foremost, it is that which is recognizable to the competencies in
process, that form these judgments.
Does this sound circular? Surely it is circular in a crucial sense. All
that we "know" comes to our attention as the work product of process in
various competencies. Ultimately the "authority" of  these high order
discriminations comes not from a judgment about the correlation between
our perceptions and the state of the "objective" world, but instead from
their immediacy. This is to say that we do not perceive and then make
judgments, our first awareness of every "thing"  is located in the
moment that the competent module forms some thing out of the possibilities.
These awareness's are not in the semantic domain. Our knowing of
particular attributes precedes the semantic transform that tags and
packages up insights, for storage and shipping. We know what we know and
we apologize for not being able to convey this knowing more effectively.
That we are able to communicate at all, is a testament to the power of
trial and error and the phenomenal similarity of our minds. This
similarity is not accidental. Even as each person is an absolutely
unique instance of humanity, what we are, is the embodiment of a
phenomenally complex tangle of historical accomplishments that is
fundamentally common to us all.
Creativity emerges via the capacity/ability to merge contexts
Biological instrumentality:
The complex objects of our knowings come to our awareness as
circumstances demand, literally selected by their features. Apprehension
of the world via a sophisticatedly evolved biological instrumentality is
an entropy hack. Life is the opportunistic bloom of a viral exploitation
of regularity in the universe.
In the beginning there was sequence, and it begat pattern and context
space. Within every context space there is a tree of combinatorial
consequences some leaves of which are potentially lucky. Blind evolution
isn't trial and error testing of mistakes (mutations), it is the random
testing of legal combinations
So who set up the game, where did the rules come from, and the design
The dynamic core of our consciousness consists of transient alignments
of Feature Value - Action loops that compete for selection in a
flicker-dance-sort of associations and sensory stimuli.
Perception is a physics hack. Timing is everything. Three dimensionality
is accessible to us via  a cross mapping within the temporal manifold.
Propagation of coherent correlations between map-mapped sheets of
neurons act as a massively parallel delay line with multiple taps.
Because both spatial and temporal coherence is preserved, the network
sorts up the objects of perception and tracks them real time. Reality is
best fit. Misperceptions happen, but its better than being blind.
Our competency at this is not postulated, it is stipulated that the high
order discriminations we perceive as qualia are exactly as amazing as
the incredible complexity of the neurological stack that gives us them.
Intentionality is an emergent design goal in secondary consciousness.
(before getting upset about intentional language, remember that it works
because reality fits.)
Phenomenal transform is a semantic label for a context shift. If you
insist on thinking of it as a happening, what's happening is that we
find ourselves switching lexicons when we discuss certain things. Its
not a description of a change of state in the object, it is a handle for
referring to a pragmatic feature of discourse about it.
The important thing to realize is that this sorting out of the features
of the objects of our perception usually is done before we are aware of
the process, but this does not mean that the process is different for
hard discriminations, just that they are taking longer than the ~400ms
self context loop, that feeds a product of the net's immediate state
back into itself. Think convolving and converging. Discrimination occurs
opportunistically, our competencies do not require conscious attention.
In the formation of PV Action loops each project become one of the
factions in our interior parliament.
We have lots of timing to tap. Response times, flicker fusion times,
saccades, pulse, peristalsis, menstruation. The royal road to cognitive
illumination is the path of chronus.

Yep, the state fights to preserve its "life"
while the people suffer their own.
The mistake of top down thinking
lies in the inability to really model large populations with rules,
too much of the action happens at the fine grained level
of every day staying alive.
When change comes, it will happen as the cummulative effects
of millions of stuborn folk who subvert excessive authourity, 'cause they need to.
