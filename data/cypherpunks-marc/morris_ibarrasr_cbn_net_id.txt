Is daily stress making you fat?  The answer is YES!  Daily stress- work, relationships, bills, traffic (even dieting) - triggers a hormonal release that signals the body to store fat.  Cortizyte® controls this fat-storing hormone - More importantly you will keep the weight off.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make crust: In a food processor blend together flour, sugar, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons water and toss until incorporated.
