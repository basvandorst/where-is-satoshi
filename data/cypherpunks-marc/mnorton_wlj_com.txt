Doing this aboveboard, and doing it with the collusion of the actors who can alter the outcome, is asking for trouble:

* distortion of markets by players who see more benefit in adjusting the expectations than in spending some relatively small amount of money
(If "Chances that weapons of mass destruction being found in Iraq by Nov. 1"  is being de-rated, in a relatively thin market of a few dozen players, then someone with an interest in altering the odds can probably do so with relatively little money...especially if the money is from a Black Budget and comes from money taken at gunpoint from (I can't resist mentioning that I was able to massively distort/sabotage the market in reputations that the Extropian list experimented with in 1993. I did this by buying "play money" (extro-dollars or whatever they were called) from other players in an out-of-band transaction. A mere $20 in U.S. money gave me a huge amount of additional spending money in this reputation market. Naturally, my reputation rose.

In the case of this DARPA market, the players are by definition the insiders, with various amounts of very non-public information about plans and contingincies. "Duh.")
And so on. So many attacks on this system.
Anyway, there _already_ are very real, hard to manipulate markets in information. We call them markets. Markets for real estate, for corn, for copper, etc. If a lot of residents of Jordan think a collapse is coming, real estate prices in Amman will fall. If a lot of technologists think a return to copper wiring is coming, copper prices will rise. And so on.
Betting on contrived propositions with relatively small amounts of money ("toy systems") and/or with play money is not very interesting.

I'm not sure that Paypal has met the needs of any enduser yet, so I'd question whether it "succeeded."   The rest of what you say seems to be to the point that modern "IP" laws tend to discourage creativity. To some extent this may be so, as with interminable term extensions, but the most immediate discouragement lies in the DMCA, not an "IP" law at all but a grant of rather unprecedented monopoly power, irrespective of creative labor, among other items of note.

PayPal apparently met the needs of its customers, which was for a low-tech, low-security, no anonymity online payment system. While I'm not saying I predicted it, neither is it surprising that something like it succeeded.
(Members of this very list had some discussions with the guy who started PayPal...I wasn't in on this, but I gather that he used some of the ideas, but not the high security/untraceability ideas...just the online payment low-hanging fruit part. The same is true of EBay, by the way, where some of our crowd developed an online system very much like what E-Bay became, but several years _after_ the AMiX system. C'est la In any case, there will be many successes and failures in Internet-related business. This list is about certain kinds of these systems, but not really about "online payments" in their general form. I'm not saying folks can't or shouldn't talk about Mondex or PayPal or FastTrack, just that they have little to do with the obvious themes of the group.
Software patents and the difficulty of "metering" usage has made this kind of experimentation, this kind of evolutionary learning, much harder to do. For example, when Intel sold the 4004 microprocessor 30 years ago, it owned a bunch of patents and trade secrets about how the chip was made, what it's design was, etc.
But it didn't force potential customers to lay out their business plans, to sign "no compete" clauses, and it did not have to devise complex ways of knowing how many chips a customer was using. The chips metered themselves, metered the patents and other IP, and Intel could sell them to guys in garage shops, companies in Boise and Peoria, and even to distributors to resell and resell.
Such is not the case with, say, the Digicash software. Since Chaum, then the Canadians, then the Indians, then First Data, etc., wanted to maximize the payoff and "get a piece of the action," they could not simply sell the technology, even bits of it, to guys in garages and people with bizarre and untested ideas.
And such software is usually not sold to unidentifiable customers. Digicash (or its descendants) will not sell one copy of its core technology to a company without draconian safeguards and audits. This is part of why a paper trail back to the users of various technologies exist when above-board licensing is used. (And why many of us would obviously then favor simply _taking_ the technology, ripping it off. This cuts the paper and liability trail. Yes, there are minor issues with "theft of intellectual property," but this is mostly smoke and mirrors anyway. No one in the Western world seems to think ideas in general are patentable, so how did RSA get patented? We've had this discussion many times over the past 11 years. And more.)
This is replicated all over the digital landscape, where software packages have complicated licensing schemes and where vendors want to see only "staid and conservative" business plans. No Digicash for BlackNet, in other words.
This whole phenomenon has dramatically slowed down exploratory developement and weird, new ideas. A couple of guys in a tilt-up in Silicon Valley simply cannot just go down to Fry's to buy some parts and try out some ideas, not in this world of licenses, audits, lawyers, and generally pointless efforts to meter usage.
Which is why doing things without benefit of any patent licenses is the best strategy. That this also requires no nexus, no trail back to a corporate office, is of course part of why it's the best strategy.

There was a weapons charge as well, which will always complicate matters considerably.  The unconventional life is a more or less fine thing until it gets perpendicular to the conventional life, usually in the form of law enforcement agents.  When that happens, and it almost surely will, what is necessary is a relatively big bunch of money, or a plea bargain.
What happened here is happening to young men (yes, usually men, and as in this case, of color) all over this country all day long every day who are found in possession of light amounts of controlled substances.  You people think being an anarchist makes you special?  Sheesh, gimme a break.

An anarchist has been sentenced to a year in jail for having links to
explosives information on his Web site.  AmeriKKKa is further fucking the
First Amendment by restricting whom he may associate with in the future,
and what views he may espouse.
As is usual in most criminal cases today, the defendent was forced to plea
bargain to avoid the threat of worse charges if he went to trial.
LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- A federal judge sentenced a man to a year
in prison Monday for creating an anarchist Web site with links to sites on
how to build bombs.
U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson sentenced Sherman Austin to more than
the prosecutor had recommended under a plea bargain.
Austin, 20, pleaded guilty in February to distributing information related
to explosives.
