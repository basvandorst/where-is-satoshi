I've never found it particularly hard to generate a client cert in
either Netscape or IE - but the time consuming part is the meatspace
component - verifying your identity to the CA/RA so they'll sign the
Of course, going through all of this to access a single page is silly.
The two useful aspect of client certs (IMNSHO) are firstly that they
allow single sign-on with access control in a way that does not require
all systems to communicate with some central authority and secondly they
give a way to bind an identity (or simply a set of
permissions/privileges/capabilities/whatevers) to a private key.
Of course, if your threat model means you must check a certificate's
validity immediately, then the first advantage is mostly gone. However,
you almost always need the second property, AFAICS, to do anything
useful with PKC.
If you have some kind of entity that binds a private key to some other
stuff, then that is a certificate, IMO. Equating certificates with X.509
is missing the point.
As for the "certificateless" model - all this really does is move the
binding from something you can carry around with you to something that
has to be done by a central authority. It is not clear to me why this is
such a marvellous improvement. Unless you happen to want to own the
central authority, of course, which, unlike certificates and CAs, is far
harder to replicate privately and therefore, presumably, potentially
even more profitable than Verisign's cash cow.

That assumes that the goal of smartcards is to increase security instead of to decrease liability.

How do you make the payment already "gone" without using a third party?

proof-of-delivery protocols might help (but they're patented, as I discovered when I reinvented them a few years back).
Simultaneous release is (provably?) impossible without a trusted third I think this is one of the interesting applications of capabilities. Using them, you can have a TTP who is ignorant of what is running - you and your vendor agree some code that the TTP will run, using capability based code. In your case, this code would verify the eGold payment and the code (difficult to do this part with certainty, of course) and release them when both were correct. Because of the capabilities, the TTP could run the code without fear, and you would both know that it performed the desired function, but neither of you could subvert it.
