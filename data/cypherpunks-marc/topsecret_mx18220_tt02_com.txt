 The Compan=
Capital Group, Inc. (OTCPK: AOCP) is a new issue stock announced publicly t=
it expects to earn .30 per share in earnings over the next 12-months with a=
stock price of only .45.  The earnings number is not based on some con=
tract or=20
aggressive outlook that has no merit.  This is a number based on what =
company has been doing for the past 10-years.  AOCP is a very profitab=
sub-prime finance company in the automotive market that has serviced a nich=
market.  The company continues to see 25% growth and has now hired an=
experienced Wall Street financier to run the business and aggressively mark=
the products and services they offer.  The low volume on this stock re=
flects the=20
view very few investors know about AOCP.  This could be considered an=
undiscovered stock.  The compan=
y has=20
announced the intent to purchase Navicom Global Positioning System, Colfax=
Financial, and Flash Automotive.  These companies combined should give=
 AOCP over=20
$8 million year in sales with nearly $2,500,000 in net profit.  Fully =
the company should have 8 million shares outstanding giving the company abo=
.30 per share in earnings.  That may seem high considering the stock i=
s trading=20
around .45 per share but it is the belief nobody is paying attention to AOC=
They key t=
o this=20
company is the financing arm.  It is not what they do but how they do =
it.  The=20
sub-prime automotive financing business has a great deal of risk which AOCP=
believes they eliminated.  The company installs Navicom (
in each and every car.  Navicom is also being acquired by Automotive C=
Group, (OTC: ACOP) which was also announced last week.  DISCLAIMER Wall Str=
