And this is certainly the wrong thing to do.  Key revocations are not
the proper way to deal with algorithmic weaknesses.  Many people will
follow your advice and destroy large parts of the web of trust, and we
don't even know yet if there's a real threat (Bernstein himself said
so a few weeks ago, for example).
You don't revoke your keys just because someone can impersonate you,
using bugs in a widespread OpenPGP implementation, do you?
