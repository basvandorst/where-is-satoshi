I highly doubt this would be effective, mainly because I don't think anyone on the kernel development side of things runs keyring refreshes in any routine fashion -- if ever. For those relying on PGP to verify downloaded releases, we provide WKD lookups This whole thing *will* probably push me towards setting up a Hagrid instance, especially if we can teach it to compare submissions against an allow-list. Not sure what I'm going to do about the whole "web of trust" side of things, though. I *really* don't like the idea of setting up any kind of certification/trust authority.
