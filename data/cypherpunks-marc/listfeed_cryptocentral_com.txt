@_subject: Re: Tunneling through a hostile proxy? 
Take a look at This allows you to tunnel through a proxy using HTTP and arrive at an external tunnel server. The tunnel link through the proxy can be encrypted using a static symmetric key (no SSL). The tunnel server can be running on a machine over which you have control on the outside of the proxy zone.
I'm assuming that you want to do what I am doing (that is to keep whatever I am doing from the proxy log files) so a symmetric key would do you and will save on the key set up.
The system is free, but is only suitable for Windows boxes.
Hope this helps.
