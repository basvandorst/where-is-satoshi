I was able to read the document on "anthrax" going to the URL address:
(Societe' Francophone de Medicine d'Urgence)
and then, click on the link referred to "Documents et liens sur le
bioterrorism de guerre, le plan BIOTOX en France"
I arrived then to: "Terrorism bacteriologique et chimique - Textes de
references" by Dr. Lannehoa - Dr. Berthier.

And the current monitoring systems... Do they work to detect the presence of
explosives in the physiological duct?

GSM cell phones with crypto options.
Some months ago, I have looked at for a model developed by SIEMENS in
collaboration with a small new company. Pushing a key, and  ..... it is all.
But I do not have additional info at present. I will try to have more
because also of my interest.
