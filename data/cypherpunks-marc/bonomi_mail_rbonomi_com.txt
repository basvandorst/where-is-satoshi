The crux of the issue is whether a single DMCA take down notice refers only
to the content itemized in the notice, or to _all_ content that matches the
identification in the notice.  It is a *significant* difference, because the
former requires the _complainant_ to identify all the 'infringing' items,
while the latter requires the notice _recipient_ to search out all other
content that matches the notice.  Obviously, each side would rather have
the other guy do all the work.`

"Without the permission of the copyright holder" _is_ contrary to
  statute, and thus 'against the law'.  As such 'illegal' is _not_
  an incorrect term to apply to the situation.
  It may not be a _criminal_ violation, but it is still proscribed by law.
  "Illegal" and "criminal" -- _these_ are different things.
  Junk faxing is illegal, Telemarketing calls to cell phones are illegal,
  Public distribution without the permission of the copyright owner is
  illegal.
  Except in special cases, none of those actions are _criminal_, but   they are all violations of law, and thus _illegal_.
  Claiming that a thing is not 'illegal' if it is not 'criminal', is similar
  to asserting "it's not a crime if you don't get caught".

'quite a source of bandwidth usage' is a bit of an overstatement, as the
traffic to/from Megaupload was somewhat over 20 terabyes, out of a total
of 10,900+ terabytes of monitored traffic.  Or about 0.189% of corporate
usage on the monitored networks.

The proverbial 'so what' applies? IF the end-user system is compromised, it *doesn't*matter* what kind of
security is used,  THAT USER is compromised.
However, there is a _MASSIVE_ difference with respect to a 'server-side'
compromise.  One break-in, on *one* machine, can expose tens of millions,
(if not hundreds of millions) of user credentials.
'male bovine excrement' applies to this strawman argument.
Leo made no claim of describing a FUSSP (final ultimate solution to stolen
passwords).  What he did describe was a methodology that could be fairly
easily implemented in the real world, =and= which effectively eliminates
the risk of _server-side_ compromise of a master 'password-equivalent' list.
Leo's proposal _does_ effectively address the risk of server-side compromise.
If implemented, it would effectively eliminate "more than half" of the

There is no 'they' that is the DMCA -- it is simply a piece of legislation.
That said, there is nothing the OP said to indicate that what he received
_was_ a DMCA 'takedown notice'. although a follow-up did *assume* that that
was what the OP received.
IF it _was_ a DMCA takedown notice, regarding 'publication' by the customer,
then yes, the ISP has a problem -- *if* they don't act "as the law requires".
Not having a copy of the actual notice the OP received, I find it necessary
to assume that the desciption the OP provided is accurate.  That it _was_
a 'complaint' about a user =downloading= something. *NOT* a DMCA takedown
notice.  With the follow-up messages indicating there _is_ a potocol in
place with a number of major ISPs  for escalating notices that 'you got
caught downloading', it seems likely that what the OP got is not DMCA 'takedown notice' stuff.  If what you got -was- DMCA takedown notice, it's
a different kettle of fish.

The OP is getting notices that someone with an IP address in a netblock
'belonging' to the ISP he operates is _downloading_ content that 'someone
else' [more than one such entity, in all probability, given that it's
bittorrent, and presumably exteral to the OP's netblock(s)] is doing the
'publishing' addressed by the DMCA, and the 'safe harbor' provisions
for ISPs.
I'm NOT SURE whether the ISP has any potential liability in _this_ situation -- there's nothing 'published' by their customer for them to
'take down', etc.
However, the *only* reasonable/rational recommedation that can be made
to the OP is "consult competent professional legal counsel in *your*
jurisdiction."  It is virtully a requirement to do this on a "paid",
"commercial", "lawyer-client" basis, and to get the 'opinion' _in_writing_,
so that *if* the advice received (and which was followed) turns out
'after the fact' to be incorrect, one has recourse aginst the lawyer's
malpractice insurance (to make one whole, as far as the 'detrimental
reliance' on the opinion that was proven to be incorrect).
*I* would be tempted to respond, *once*, to the issuer of such notices,
to the effect that customemr info is disclosed only upon receipt of a
valid court subpoena, and the 'records production' costs are $$/hr, with
an $xx minimum. And, if they persited in the FUD notices, I would explicitly
*block* the source (not 'discard', but actively block -- so that they have
'actual notice' of non-delivery).
I *WOULD*, however, take my own advice, and pay a competent lawyer for
a consultation, BEFORE actually doing anything of the sort.

It is worth noting that 47 U.S.C. 230 provides _limited_ protections, only.
Broad protection, but limited.  It says that a provider shall not 'be treated as author' for material provided by someone else.
This of little-to-no help with regard to kiddie porn, since distribution, and even 'mere' possession,  are crimes -- independant of authorship.
