We have to be more pragmatic tor is horrendously slow/unusable in some
of these countries, and as long as you take some steps like not using
single hop for either Proxies or VPNs, then you are addressing the
treat model that they face, not one that we are making up in our
heads. I realize that it is not perfect, and there is a trade off, but
people on the ground are looking at it and making that choice for
I've spent a lot of time working on issues with Syria lately, the
universal report is that tor is terrible slow, they can't use tails
because it takes too long to download/ is blocked, and their data
might leak if if they use Tor, so using a VPN with some precautions
taken is much more appetizing.

And as a follow up on this list:
I have one report from one ISP(Sawa) that things are blocked. I am now
trying to collect more info to see if it is something implemented at
the ISP level or something at the exit points for the entire country.
These international connections fall under the control of STE(State
Telecom Establishment) and the PDN/PDN2 backbone that they control,
which everyone else rides on top of. In the past all blocking was
ordered and relayed through STE, but implemented at the ISP level.
This resulted in discrepancies and uneven filtering as ISP choose to
interpret the rules a little differently, as well as using different
to tech to implement the orders from the Syrian Government. If this is
a uniform block across all ISPs, then it indicates that STE has
stepped in and and taken responsibility. It also indicates that they
may have acquired new gear, as they did not have the capacity or
skills to take part in such activity in the past.
