You probably set the encoding to ISO-8859-1. Unfortunately,
the byte 0x92 in ISO-8859-1 encoding does not represent a
valid XML character, check the spec at
  Windows uses the bytes 0x80...0x9F in its own extension of
8859-1 (and other encodings), which is usually called Windows
codepage 1252 (and similar). Check whether your XML parser on
the target platform can understand this encoding, and how it
denotes it (CP-1252 or something, although there is no standard).
If the parser can't deal with the Windows character encoding,
your only way out is to replace the offending characters with
character references for their Unicode counterparts before
feeding it into the XML application.
