Dell Computers have dangerous power pinouts!
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   Not only has Dell offended us with regards to guns but
even their recent computers are designed to give offense.
Firstly, with regards to guns here is a summation post
by Matthew Gaylor: Dell Computer Firearm Fiasco Roundup
 I have found more damming information on the Dell Computer
 Corporation. This regards very bad Dell Computer design.
 Here, it follows:
The following is from the book: UPGRADING AND REPAIRING PCs

My fellow Cypherpunks,
   This then brings up the question of Open Source operating systems like
the (GNU) Linux distributions and the BSD operating
systems. Is the TCPA/DRM feature code to be published or censored out? For
the source code, will the censored code
be a binary file? This could be a mess. I believe that there was a
discussion of US mandated Malice code in Open
Source operating systems on the Cypherpunks list recently, but I couldn't
find it with a Google search. Anybody got a
Cypherpunk Hyperarchive link?
   If the above happens, it would keep the coding anarchists busy for years
:-) Recompiling your operating system with
an outlaw file included would be an anarchic and patriotic act. It could
also knock down Microsoft market share.
   I suspect the the US solution would be hardware. All new hardware would
be maliced and old hardware would become

THE
LIBERTY DOLLAR

   The Liberty Dollar is (at least) partially precious metal backed and is
not fiat money.  In fact, it may be considered fully backed!
If you accept the standard deal offered by NORFED then the $US-Libery Dollar
exchange does not go well for you :-) Negotiate!
Actually, since the silver redeemability is fixed, then I think that we must
consider the Liberty FULLY backed and not fiat.  It merely
appears only partially backed since the initial $ exchange offering could be
better :-) -And I bet we can get better terms.
   Also, it is NOT DEBT ISSUED! (DOOM ISSUED!)
It does not enrich a ruling elite. In fact, it subverts their trechery.  It
is also a choice. It is not forced on us by legal tender laws.
See my above text.

   The value of the Liberty Dollars is determined by both their
denominations and by their "bases". For instance, a $10 LIberty bill
with a "$10 base" also printed on it could be redeemed for 1 oz. of silver.
A $10 Liberty bill with with a "$20 base" printed on it
could be redeemed for 1/2 oz. of silver.  A $20 Liberty bill with a "$20
base" printed on it could be redeemed for 1 oz. of silver.
   Now, if you bought a $10 Liberty bill with "base 10" on it and NORFED
then started using a $20 base - no problem - your $10
Liberty bill could still be redeemed for the 1 oz. of silver that you were
entitled to at the time you bought the bill. You are not left
"holding the bag".
   As explained in the NORFED text below, if you are a redemption center,
then you can get a price break by buying in volume. This
increases your profit. As far as your customers who buy Liberty Dollars from
you - officially you charge a set premium on these dollars
to customers, but I bet you don't have to. I think that you would be allowed
to give a price break to customers. This would cut your profits
but that might not bother you too much and maybe you are an ideologue. This
would also allow the Liberty Dollar "end buyers" to take a
minimum loss. If done well, all the Liberty Dollar buyers would take, at
most,  a small hit on the store of value function.
   Also, there  are other values of honest, non-fiat money.  For instance,
the Liberty Dollar is inflation RESISTANT.  That would protect us
in inflationary times.  We are so used to inflation that we think it goes on
indefintely. However, it looks to me like we are headed for a deflationary
depression. I think that in that case the Liberty Dollar would  almost
certainly  lose value against the $US, but
I think it  would give good general protection against deflation too. The
TRANSACTION function: I think this is where much of its
potential lies and this needs a lot of experimenting. GENERATION: The
Liberty Dollar is partially backed by silver and, therefore,
is NOT DEBT CREATED!  This is a very major value! Debt generated money dooms
Here are the financial incentives for becoming a redemption center:

My fellow Cypherpunks,
                    The Liberty Dollar
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   I think I may have some really great news here, but you all
can check it out to be sure. I found an alternative money on the
Internet. It is called the Liberty Dollar. The Internet site is:
NORFED  is  The National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve
Act and the Internal Revenue Code.
   The money is backed by silver and gold and can be redeemed widely
in America.
   As many of you know, the $US is a corrupt, proprietary, debt issued,
fait, fractional reserved,illegal, unconstituional, U. S. State enforced
monopoly currency. As
corrupt as it is I don't know why it hasn't already collasped and
dragged us down with it!
   If the Liberty Dollar is honest and robust, then it may be the
vehical to beat the elite bankers tyranny and give us an honest
wealth produced money.

My fellow Cypherpunks,
   I found this link about WinXP SP1  .  SP stands for "service pack". The
article tells of some nasty goodies that MicroSoft has included
in it. The 2nd link has more info..
   You know, sometime we are going to have to abandon MS. I've already got a
dual booting system: MS and Red Hat Linux. I am slowly
migrating functions to Linux. The (GNU) Linux's and the free BSD's are good
alternatives to MS. If you can't live without MS, then make
your computer system dual booting.  Also, dual booting will allow you to
make a fairly easy migration to a DECENT operating system .
MS is getting more and more oppressive.
