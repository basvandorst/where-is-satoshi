AnswerChase and CHADIS
AnswerChase has reached an agreement with the Center for Promotion of Child Development through Primary Care to integrate the
components of the PROve software into CHADIS (Child Health and Development Interactive System) to enhance its resource
identification capability from open Web sources. Raymond Sturner MD, co-director of CHADIS and Associate Professor of
Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, believes that AnswerChase technology can be instrumental in helping CHADIS
reach its objectives and vision. CHADIS facilitates comprehensive pediatric care by enabling the parent to systematically review and pinpoint concerns about
the childs behavior and development and to highlight perceived strengths on computerized questionnaires.  This
parent-generated information is transmitted to the health care providers worksheet within an electronic medical record of
the visit.  Parent concerns are translated, on the worksheet, into potential DSM-PC (the new standard expert derived manual
for categorizing a range of mild to severe mental health problems in a primary care setting) categories of developmental
variation, problem or DSM IV (the established psychiatric standard definition of disorder) mental health disorder.
Clinical guides for responding to the concern are also provided including: clinical tips; age related anticipatory guidance
information; potential contributing factors and eliciting trigger questions (including those suggested by Bright Futures);
definitions of the terms (e.g. criteria for diagnosing disorders); differential and co-morbid diagnoses; details of the items
the parent selected; bulleted key concepts about the problem; and specific management suggestions from which to choose for
the particular patient.  In addition, the system provides the health provider with a list of potentially useful resources (e. g., an appropriate
support group or quality daycare information) that match up with factors the clinician determines are related to the parental
concern. A list of resources to promote strengths in the child (e g., programs and mentors for sports or music) is also
provided on the worksheet.  An individualized parent report (including a picture of the child and parent) is generated at the
end of the visit, based on data suggested by the parent and further modified by the health provider, including
recommendations and information for parents along with specific information for accessing any suggested resources. .
Objective Oriented Intelligence Methodology Israeli Internet expert Jacob Bar, who is the director of non-profit R&D data center MATIMOP in Tel Aviv, joins AnswerChase's
team of instructors for the Intelligence Monitoring (IM) courses. Because Bars methodology, called Objective Oriented
Intelligence, is derived from the familiar concepts of management by objectives, it helps the user to achieve specific
quantitative and qualitative results from IM activities.  Examples of the Objective Oriented Intelligence output include
Systematic monitoring of competitors and their activities
Systematic identification of business opportunities and threats
Location of strategic partners
Location of technologies or new products as substitutes for in house R & D Identification of new customers for existing products Generation of ideas for new products and their best design
Information for deepening marketing and sales to existing customers Information for planning and conducting purchasing Information for strategic planning Market, product and consumers research Other relevant information which may influence the achievement of a given target or objective.
AnswerChase plans to incorporate Jacob Bar's methodology into PROve product family as one of its powerful options for
knowledge acquisition. Development is expected to start in early 2002.
 Best is yet to come...
As we enter the last quarter of 2001, the unprecedented market turmoil following the tragic events of September 11 has
presented the IT sector one of its most challenging tests ever. Many software developers have had to reorganize, rethink,
redesign and "reinvent the wheels" of their business models. Despite these though times, we, at AnswerChase, subscribe to the
idea that the best of the Internet is yet to come especially in the areas of automation and intelligent agents. A recent
article on Informationweek.com starts with these
supporting arguments: When the U.S. economy was booming, companies focused their
business-intelligence efforts on their customers as they sought to understand who was buying what and why. But businesses are
now confronting a recession as well as new concerns about the reliability of global supply chains, raising the importance of
cost-cutting and operational efficiency goals. As a result, they're increasingly turning business-intelligence tools toward
analyzing their supply-chain processes and suppliers. The continuing growth of business-critical information on
the Web has not slowed down a bit. That is a sign of proactive and healthy e-business environment which is bound to inspire
new technology development and rejuvenate capital investments sooner or later. Let's keep the faith, tomorrow is a sunny day.
Riza C. Berkan, PhD, Chairman.  Computational Web Intelligence in IEEE
Pioneering initiatives of Prof Yanqing Zhang, Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, has resulted in the
acceptance of "Computational Web Intelligence" (CWI) as a topic for special session in the upcoming IEEE Conference in
Hawaii. Prof Yanqing Zhang explains the progress as follows:
With explosive growth of the Internet, wireless networks, Web sites and Web databases, Web users suffer from too many
irrelevant Web
search results (pages, links, etc.), fraud e-business transactions,
non-personalized Web information, even wrong Web decisions, etc. To
increase the Web QoI (Quality of Intelligence) and improve the Web
QoS (Quality of Service) as well, WI (Web Intelligence), a new broad
research area, was proposed by Yao, Zhong, Liu and Ohsuga at IEEE
COMPSA 2000. WI is a general hybrid technology which applies
Intelligent Technology (IT) and Information Technology (IT) to make
Web intelligent, efficient and safe for Web users. Since the first
IT includes many different intelligent techniques, this proposal
only focuses on using Computational Intelligence (CI) and Web
Technology (WT) to construct Computational Web Intelligence (CWI).
CWI, an important research area of WI, is the fundamental topic of
the proposed special session of FUZZ-IEEE2002. The special session
on CWI will provide a forum for leading experts in CI, WI and CWI
to discuss theoretical issues, applications and future development
of CWI deeply and carefully. Six papers will be invited to present
different fundamental ideas, basic methodologies and Web applications
of this novel research area.
To promote the use of fuzzy Logic in the Internet, 2001 BISC
INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON FUZZY LOGIC AND THE INTERNET (FLINT2001)
was held at UC Berkeley, Aug. 14-18, and a BISC Special Interest
Group on Fuzzy Logic in the Internet has been formed. Professor Zadeh
highlighted "fuzzy logic may replace classical logic as what may be
called the brainware of the Internet". Clearly, the intelligent Web
brainware based on CI plays a critical role in e-Business, e-Commerce,
intelligent Web agents, smart Web search engines, Web data mining and
knowledge discovery, Web education, Web decision and prediction, Web
security, etc. To continue to promote the use of CI in Web applications, the special
session on CWI is proposed. In summary, the special session on CWI
will exploit fundamental frameworks, basic methods, major applications
and future trends of CWI based on CI, WT and other relevant techniques,
and will investigate how to make the intelligent Web brainware for
Web applications based on CWI.
