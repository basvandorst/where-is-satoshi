@_subject: Digital Binoculars! They take REAL Pictures! 
Give Digital Binoculars for Christmas!
Capture the Action!
Imagine taking a picture from nearly a mile away and having it look as if you were only 20 feet away. It doesn't get any better than that. Like the times when we go to a baseball game and the only seats available are way out in left field. Deep left field. Try seeing the batter with a regular camera from that distance. Ain't gonna happen. With the Binocular Digital Camera you'll be able to snap a close-up of the batter just as he makes contact with the ball for the game tying run. And you won't miss a single euphoric expresion on his wide eyed face. Pictures so close people will be wondering how you got permission to take photos from the pitchers mound.  CLICK HERE!
Get Close to Nature!
Imagine camping in the wilderness and spotting what appears to be an eagles nest. How about wale watching from shore. You're never too far away with the Binocular Digital Camera. Every shot feels as if you are right there in the action.  CLICK HERE!
