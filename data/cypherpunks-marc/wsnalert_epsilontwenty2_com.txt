            According to the press release, The Lower Cedar Grove seam should             produce approximately 20,000 clean tons per month by the end of the             second quarter of 2005. The current market price for washed Lower             Cedar Grove coal is $60 per ton FOB Delbarton West Virginia.             Keep your eyes open for future developments. The press release also             states that Quest is also continuing its core drilling program to             refine coal reserve estimates on the Slaters Branch property.             Current reserve estimates are more than 12,000,000 tons in place in             six seams.
 Background
            In case you are not familiar with the company: Quest acquires and             operates energy and mineral related properties in the southeastern             part of the United States. Quest focuses on properties that produce             quality compliance blend coal. Quest currently owns and operates one             drift mine at Burning Fork, which is four miles northeast of             Pikeville Kentucky, and one deep mine at Pond Creek in Belfry             Kentucky. Quest also operates a deep mine at Bear Fork under             contract. Quest's steam coal is currently sold on the spot market to             certain brokers who in turn sell to utilities and industrial clients             as fuel for power plants.             With the recent acquisition of E-Z Mining, Gwenco, D&D, and the             beginning of a marine terminal joint venture with Monday Coal, Quest             looks forward to taking greater advantage of the strong market for             compliance coal. Quest continues to identify expansion opportunities             in its geographic focus and to develop and open mines at already             acquired properties.             Recent Investment

QUEST MINERALS & MINING EXPANDS RESERVES AT SLATER'S BRANCH MINE!
Dec. 10, 2004 Quest Minerals and Mining Corp. announced the             expansion of reserves at the Slater's Branch Mine. Initial reserve             estimates of 3,000,000 tons of coal at Pond Creek had previously             been based on a 26 inch average seam height. "Based on these core             samples we expect our current recoverable reserves at the Slater's             Branch properties to increase by as much as 50%," said William             "Randy" Wheeler, CEO of Quest Minerals and Mining. "Quest should be             mining clean coal from this seam by the end of December with a run             rate of 20,000 tons per month by the end of the first quarter of             2005." Coal buyers refer to Pond Creek coal as "super compliance"             coal, commanding over $60 per ton FOB at the Big Sandy Docks.
