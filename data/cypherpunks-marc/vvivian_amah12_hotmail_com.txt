Dear  Sir,
I am Mrs. Vivian Amah, my husband   Late Mr. Manfred Amah was a big farmer and I am house wife though I helped him occasionally in his work at the farm
, Unfortunately he died two  months ago after a protracted illness at the age of
60,during our marriage we had four daughters and no male child, In this part of
African country where we live ,there is this obnoxious culture that makes it
impossible for you to inherit your spouse wealth if you have no male child , My
husbands relations accused me of killing my own husband all in a bid to scare
and drive me and my  daughters away , I was subjected to all kinds of cultural
torture and forced to drink the water used in bathing my late husbands corpse ,as
it is believed that this practice will cause my death if I eventually had a hand
in my husbands death ,now my husband has just been buried and already I and my
children are facing a serious hard time ,my husbands relations ,have now seized
all his valuable properties including cars ,houses, tractors and his entire farm
,we have been locked out of the main house and relegated to a small room at the
back of our house which was used as a store ,here we all lie down on ordinary
mat on bare floor and as their culture demands ,we are not allowed to bath ,see
visitors or even remove the mourning cloth day in day out till after a year .
I had to snick out to come on net to look for help from any God fearing
person, from whom God can rescue us so that I can escape abroad with my children ,when my husband was alive ,he loved me so dearly and we were the best of friends and as a result ,he never hid anything from me ,I am aware of monies he
left in the bank here and all his properties but all the documents are now with
my husbands wicked relations ,I am now powerless ,because I have no money to
hire a lawyer to pursue my course and to worsen it ,There is no will before he
died ,neither do I have anybody to help me ,but my only hope of survival now is
the last money transaction which my husband made before he died which no body in
his family knows except me ,
My husband paid 4.6 million Dollars into a different account few weeks before
his ill health and this money was to be remitted to a company abroad for purchase
of new farm tools ,tractors and other preservative equipments for his farm ,now
this is my last hope ,all I want from you is to assist me to find a way to come
over with this money abroad with my children ,or find a way of remitting this
money to you for safekeeping ,so that you can help me invest it in your country
to enable me have the means to train my children and live my life overseas ,I
know that this money is stuck in an account ,but with the service of a lawyer ,I
can be made the owner/Inheriter  of the money since I know the bank and have all
the details and since the bank is aware of my husbands demise ,while you become
the beneficiary of the money ,as the bank is aware that the money was meant for
the payment to a foreign firm for purchase of equipments ,if I should boldly ask
the bank for the money ,they may become suspicious and make things difficult for
me since my late husband did not leave any instruction for the money to be given
to me ,so the best way to get the money is to see it remitted abroad for the
bank to be convinced that my late husbands instructions is carried out to the
latter .
As I write you this letter I tremble in fear, because if I am seen outside I
will be in more trouble and we might be casted out to the street ,Please if you
can give me a helping hand ,please hurry so that I can be able to conclude and
move out abroad with my children as soon as possible ,I will make sure I pay and
Compensate you financially, you are also free to name your price but I know that
I will not disappoint you. Please write me urgently now .
Mrs V .AMA
