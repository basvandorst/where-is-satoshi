Have a look at this:
This is the most comprehensive CD-ROM containing 100,000,000 fresh email addresses. This directory was last updated Feb/2002. There are over 34 different categories on the cd such as:
* Geographic (by City, State, Province, Country, Industry etc..)
* Interest Group (such as opportunity seekers, adult, travel, network marketers etc..)
* Statistic (i.e. people who spent more than $1000 on the web in the last 2 months,
people who registered a domain name in the last month, etc..)
Addresses are fully exportable text files and work in any program like Eudora, Outlook Express, Hotmail, Yahoo, Etc...
How did we compile such a large list?
1. We bought virtually every other email directory on the Internet and put it through an extensive email verification process thus eliminating all the dead addressess.
2. We use custom software which spiders through the web searching websites, newsgroups and many other online databases with given keywords like area codes, industries, city names etc.. to find millions of fresh new addresses every week.
