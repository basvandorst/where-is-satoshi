@_subject: RE: What email encryption is actually in use? 
I've always been intrigued by the volume of reports which indicate that when hackers or other outlaws raid a corporate site, the first thing they do is scan the stored email files of company executives.
Funny, with all the attention focused pushing the user to encrypt email for transmission, no one ever suggests that Admins should/could store all email on the local mail server in an encrypted format.
Am I wrong, does some mail server do this?  If not, anyone got any suggestions for an efficient design?
