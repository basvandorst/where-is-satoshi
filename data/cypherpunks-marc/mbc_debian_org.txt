How about this news?
Last night in the State of the Union address, Bush repeated the lie
that Iraq is creating nuclear weapons, stating the evidence of the
aluminum tubes purchased, which he claimed were used to enrich
These remarks were made despite the fact, discussed here:
that the International Atomic Energy Agency's report on Monday stated
clearly that the tubes "cannot be used directly for [uranium]
So, Bush is either illiterate or just flat out lying, once again.

And what list would that be? I'd like to take a look at it.
Last summer I read "the physics of consciousness". It was a pretty
disappointing attempt to explain consciousness with QM, mixed with
lots of emotional and relgious hand waving, nice background info
Anyway, this is exactly why I want to do computational neuroscience. I
also think that the turing machine is a sorely classical model, and
that the brain is definitely not a turning machine, but something
else, far more powerful.
As for making a neuron, look into the research of henry abarbanel. I
was in his lab the other day, and his students have actually made
simple neurons that can be wired into the brain of a lobster to
simulate removed neurons, creating the proper oscillation to generate
the signals which allow the lobster to digest things. He mostly does
research into the nonlines dynamic properties of neurons. I'm hoping
to work in his lab next year.

People do break cyphers, by finding weaknesses in them. Are you saying
that you think that current cyphers are unbreakable?
Also, what about using biological systems to create strong cyphers,
not to break them?
It seems that all of these analyses assume that an instruction is a
single mathematical operation in a turing machine. What if each
operation was something else? I refuse to believe that the human mind
is just a turing machine.
