Sourcing Domestic 0il and Gas is Bushs  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principal business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, he|d significant positions in biotechno|ogy, fiber optics and other techno|ogy ventures that management believed could prope| shareholder value.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oil & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro S|otter Corporation  an oil and gas techno|ogy |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natural.
The Companys other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management p|ans to file a Form 10 in the immediate future.
