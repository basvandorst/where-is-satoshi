If you are really worrying about that, you are decades too late. :)
ARM-TZ-alike features are already there in other CPU's called SMM, VT-x or SVM,
or in your board called IPMI or AMT - or more generic OOB-Management. Or if you
worry about phones its called SIM and SIM-toolkit (and this list is far
from complete).
Yes, if you want a real trustbase and crypto that stands, you have to open-source
all of it.
Do you know what your keyboard controller is doing? :)
