@_subject: Tor nodes blocked by e-gold 
Since 24 hours, e-gold has decided to block all TOR nodes, and not only. In fact they check 3 "spam databases" and if the user's IP is in one of them, e-gold just declines any operation, people cannot even login into their accounts.
There are a few things here:
It is the first time I see a website blocking IP that appear in SPAM databases! Spam is, as far as I know, an EMAIL problem, so why would a domain block surfing from these IP?
About TOR particularly, I feel very strange that all exit nodes would be listed in spam databases, as most of them (if not all) don't accept sending mail requests. That is why I rather believe that e-gold in fact fetches the TOR exit nodes list, and directly block their IP addresses.
A friend, connecting from his home in Germany without TOR, without any proxy, cannot enter his account as his IP address (a dynamic one from a dialup provider) was listed 2 months ago for spam!!!
A few people are already complaining that they cannot get into their accounts, and so their money seems to be lost! E-gold was already known to block accounts without any warning and explanations, recently blocked accounts of all Iranian people and KEPT their funds, now they automatize the scam process!
E-gold seems to be the next (or TODAY'S) major scam of the internet!

Great joke, as Germany isn't alone, all the EU is concerned. Also US has his Big Brother, Russia his SORM2, China his commies, etc etc
But there is one requirement that was suggested a lot of times and that sadly seems not to be implemented, it is to NOT allow more than one node in the same country, on a TOR circuit. This should be an option, activated by default.
That should considerably limit the risk of anonymity break.
Sad that (as far as I know), it isn't scheduled.
