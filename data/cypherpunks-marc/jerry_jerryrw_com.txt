For me the features were many but mainly; Near seamless big three multi platform compatibility, TC volumes on thumb drives and in the dropbox open pretty much everywhere.  While I nver had the need to use them the deniable containers seemed useful for travelers.
The consternation that governments have had with it is a bonus.  If they can break it, they are classifying it high enough to not break it in public.  Would make it seem to be fairly secure.
