For them, the people that know the changes they made, they can still trust the system as much as they ever have. I have no doubt that for them it is as secure as ever and I think that helps explain why they cling to this claim. You and I, however, don't have that advantage and therefore can't trust it.
To the extent that you ever trusted this statement, it is still as true as it ever was. What has changed is more likely your realization that the system relies on resources necessarialy beyond your control and inspection. If their statement isn't true now, it wasn't true then.
I wouldn't be so suprised at such a ruling, although I'd really like to hear from someone with familiarity with German law.
If this is their proverbial cry for attention, then I kind of like the strategy. Consider that with explicit external notification of any sort (anonymous remailer, etc...), they are the ones taking action to subvert the system intentionally. Assuming that the opponent in this situation is a governmental entity with local physical enforcement power, then there's not a lot of situations in which they can imagine being verifiably unobserved in making any kind of public statement. Putting this in a CVS commit, however, allows them to claim that they were just trying to comply (wink wink) and doesn't run larger risks since there's nothing out of the ordinary to deny.
This doesn't mean I trust them, but it is probably one of the better ways for them to subvert the order IMO.
