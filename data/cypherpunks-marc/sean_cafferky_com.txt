@_subject: Updates 
I'm a user and donor.  I have implemented an officewide adoption of OOo 1.1.0 instead of MSOffice.  In addition, I evangelize to friends and family.
Recently, I have been upgrading Windows machines to the latest 1.1.3.  However, it is highly inconvenient.  First, I am forced to download the entire installation executable all over again.  I suggest you allow for updates directly from within OOo.   Or, that you make update-only executables available, to lower strain on your and my bandwidth.   Second, once the upgrade installation begins, OOo attempts to install each version into its own version-specific folder.  I suggest you have a default path of ".../OpenOffice/"  and NOT .../OpenOffice-vX.X.X/    I am sure you can find other niceties to improve the upgrade process.
Finally, there seems to be some difficulty in associating file extensions with OpenOffice.  When I install the software as Admin, the extensions (.sxw, .sxc, et cetera) are associated with OpenOffice, but only for that user... not throughout the computer.  Normally, software changes file extension associations for ALL users of a Windows computer (for example, installing Acrobat allows all users to click on .pdf files easily.)   I strongly suggest you tweak the installation to allow this (even if it's a checkbox option in the install wizard, instead of automatic... though I cannot imagine a situation where an Admin would NOT want extensions associated for all users on the machine).    Also, it would be GREAT if the install routine asked the installer if they wanted to ALSO associate MS Office extensions (.doc, .xls, et cetera) with OpenOffice at the time of installation (with the ability to apply that option to all users on the machine, as well).  This would make life much easier.
(If it matters, 99% of the machines I user, administer, touch and know... are Win2K.)
Thanks for listening!
