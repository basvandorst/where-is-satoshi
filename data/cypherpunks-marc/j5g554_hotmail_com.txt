Hey Cypherpunks,
I work as a massage therapist. I just recently had my admittance into the bisexual world and I totally love it. I still like a good guy too, but I am very eager to get to know otherbi babes.
I am very friendly, very healthy and very affectionate. I love just about anything outdoors but can spend hours and hours in bed. I love being with girls and men alike.
I am looking for a very sexy person.
If this sounds good to you then maybe I am your girl. Love Rebecca april comic plump steel bluey linux an grill crave ought was rhode abaft
