@_subject: Re: in praise of gold 
My point is not to comment on coins, gold or gold digging, but to note that these topics are tied together in the archaic mind of which there is abundance on this list.
In his review of COINS, BODIES, GAMES, AND GOLD (Leslie Kurke, Princeton University Press, 1999), L. Randall Wray makes the following points in the March 2001 edition of THE JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES.
" . . . it has long been established that the first coins were issued in Lydia and East Greece, probably no earlier than the third or fourth quarter of the seventh century BC.  The dating is puzzling, because we also know that money, local markets, long-distance trade, and even complex financial instruments existed for thousands of years before coins were invented.  If precious metal coins were indeed invented to reduce transaction costs, one wonders why it took so long for sophisticated traders to discover them.
" . . . As Karl Polany warned long ago, the Greek economy was 'embedded' in other noneconomic institutions, 'the economic process itself being instituted through kinship, marriage, age-groups, secret societies, totemic associations, and public solemnities.'
" . . . She [Leslie Kurke] begins by quoting an intriguing passage form Herodotus:
'The Lydians use customs very similar to those of the Greeks, apart from the fact that they prostitute their female children.  And first of men whom we know, they struck and used currency of gold and silver, and they were also the first retail traders.  And the Lydians themselves claim that also the games that now exist for them and for the Greeks were their invention.'
"Note how Herodotus juxtaposes prostitution, coinage, retail trade, and games--all (inaccurately) attributed to the Lydians, who are otherwise supposed to be much like the Greeks. As Kurke wonders, 'Why do all these phenomena form a natural class . . .'
" . . . while prostitution, games, and retail trade are frequently discussed and linked in the [period] literature, coinage is virtually never discussed (at least in a positive sense; almost all references are to counterfeiting).  Quite the contrary, Kurke insists . . . for concern with what the texts _don't_ say. She also notes that the greatest Greek democracy, Athens, produced not a single text supportive of democracy--rather, all contemporaneous discussion of Athenian political theory was written by a hostile elite.
" . . . In her view, 'the minting of coin would represent the state's assertion of its ultimate authority to constitute and regulate value in all spheres in which general-purpose money operated simultaneously--economic, social, political, and religious.  Thus, state-issued coinage as a universal equivalent, like the civic _agora_ in which it circulated, symbolized the merger in a single token or site of many different domains of value, all under the final authority of the city.'
"In a sense, the choice of precious metals for coinage was a historical accident, a pointed challenge to the elite monopoly over precious metal.  By coining precious metal, the _polis_ appropriated the highest sphere of gift exchange, and with its stamp it asserted its ultimate authority--both inwardly (or domestically) but also outward (in long-distance trade): 'For every Greek _polis_ that issued its own coin asserted its autonomy and independence from every other Greek city, while coinage also functions as one institution
among many through which constituted itself as the final instance against the claims of an internal elite.'  As the _polis_ used coins for its own payments and insisted on payment in coin, it inserted its sovereignty into retail trade in the _agora_.  Mainstream economists frequently assert that growth of the local market was associated with expansion of democracy, but Kurke stands the typical Austrian argument on its head by noting the critical role played by the _polis_ in wresting control away from the elite.
" . . . introduction of coins arose out of a 'seventh/sixth century crisis of justice and unfair distribution of property.'  Coins appeared at this particular time because the _polis_ had gained sufficient strength to rival the _symposia_, -hetaireiari_ (private drinking clubs), and other institutions and _xenia_ (elite networking) that maintained elite dominance.  At the same time, the _agora_ and its use of coined money subverted hierarchies of gift exchange, just as a shift to taxes and regular payments to city officials (as well as severe penalties levied on officials who accepted gifts) challenged the 'natural' order that relied on gifts and favors.  It is no coincidence that elite literary works disparaged the _agora_ as a place for deceit and that coinage was always noted for its 'counterfeit' quality.
" . . . Obviously the elite reacted to such developments, although in a veiled manner.  When money is discussed in the texts, its introduction is invariably attributed to tyrants who destroy the _nomos_, the community, and the divine order.  It is also interesting that the elite usually attributes invention of money to the requirements of scorned retail trade--just as modern economics does, albeit without scorn--rather than to the struggle to assert sovereignty of the _polis_.  As Kurke argues, this 'mystification' of the origins of money is ideological--as it remains today--a purposeful rejection of the legitimacy of democratic government.
"A major portion of the book is devoted to elite representations of games and 'bodies' (prostitution, objectification of women, and artistic depiction of the female form).  Recall from the quote above that Herodotus linked Lydian creation of coinage to invention of games and prostitution of female children.  Kurke notes that the whole array of Greek games emerged at the same time as coins and wonders how games form a natural class with coins in literary texts--with games of chance ridiculed while games of order were held to be appropriate.  She argues that games of chance served as a shorthand for all the vices of a disembedded economy: the acquisition of small profits by shameful means and creation of random fortunes as opposed to the 'natural' fortuned gained through aristocratic birth.
"Just as two classes of games were created, two classes of prostitute were invented at the time of coinage. . . . it becomes necessary for the elite to distinguish their prostitutes from those used by the citizens.  Thus, the _hetariai_ (courtesans) who frequented the _symposia_ to exchange their services for 'gifts' were distinguished from the _pornai_ (whores) who serviced citizens for coins. Kurke notes that the _polis_ created cheap public brothels for use by the citizens because 'to be a citizen means always having a place to put your penis.'"

@_subject: Surprising Popularity of Paper Currency 
" . . . Why hasn't paper and metal currency already gone the way of the horse and buggy? With credit and debit cards, online banking, and so on, why isn't the demand for currency steadily shrinking to zero?"
This from the IMF quarter newsletter "Finance" in the article "The Surprising Popularity of Paper Currency" by Kenneth S. Rogoff at
which continues:
"Curiously, all prognostications about Internet money to the contrary, there is not a shred of evidence that the public is about to give up currency in the United States, Europe, or Japan. Indeed, evidence of the reverse is stunning.
"Let's start with the United States. At the end of 2001, currency per capita (held by the public) exceeded $620 billion, or roughly $2,200 for every man, woman, and child. I don't know about you, but I usually don't carry one-tenth that much currency in my wallet, nor does my brother Harry. Moreover, over 65 percent of it was held in $100 bills (the largest denomination), which means that the typical American family should be holding sixty $100 bills. Yet Federal Reserve Board surveys find that, on average, the typical American family does not hold even a single $100 bill!
"Where is the missing money? Some of it can be found in obvious places like supermarket cash registers, but only a very little, according to extensive government surveys. In fact, surveys of domestic households and businesses can account for only 5 percent of the U.S. currency in circulation. Where is the rest, the other 95 percent? A big chunk is probably held abroad, though estimates vary wildly from 30 percent to 75 percent (my 1998 Economic Policy article estimated 50 percent). Even if the number is at the high end, say, 75 percent, that still leaves $2,200, held domestically within the United States, for every family of four. Economists presume that most of this cash can be found in the 'underground economy.'"

Question for Faustine: Is what is, right? Or is it man-made and can be changed by men?
Faustine may want to rethink this. Social Darwinism does not square with the Thomas Paine quote. Just one example of debunking Social Darwinism is at
"A number of critics see the use of selection theory in other than biological contexts as forcing malign political and moral commitments. A prime example of this is sociobiology, which is supposed to result in such things as eugenics, racism, and the death of the welfare state. Sociobiology, and the more recent evolutionary psychology movement, seeks to explain human behaviour in terms of the adaptations of human evolution. Gould especially has been vitriolic in his attacks on sociobiological explanations. It is thought by some to result in a completely selfish ethic known as rational egoism.
"Another such view is "Social Darwinism", which holds that social policy should allow the weak and unfit to fail and die, and that this is not only good policy but morally right. The only real connection between Darwinism and Social Darwinism is the name. . . .
"The claims made by Social Darwinists and their heirs suffer from the ethical fallacy known as 'the naturalistic fallacy' . . . This is the inference from what may be the case to the conclusion that it is therefore right. However, while it is certainly true that, for example, some families are prone to suffer diabetes, as mine is, there is no licence to conclude that they should not be treated, any more than the fact that a child has a broken arm from a bicycle accident implies that the child should have a broken arm. David Hume long ago showed that 'is' does not imply 'ought'.
"In fact, diverse political and religious opinions characterise social musings based upon evolutionary biology. For example, the 19th century Russian anarchist aristocrat Pyotr Kropotkin wrote a book called Mutual Aid [1902, cf Gould 1992] in which he argued that evolution results more in cooperation than it does in harsh competition. His views are echoed in recent use of games theory to show that, in some cases at least, cooperation is a stable strategy for certain populations to adopt [Axelrod 1984]."

As the article points out, $1 million fits in a briefcase nicely but the Euro's largest denomination is 500 which will allow $1 million to fit into a purse. From the article:
" I am not an expert in cryptography, but I think it may take quite a while to devise an electronic money that guarantees anonymity in the same way that cash does."

Um, that $4 trillion didn't move around in trucks speeding on highways. It's just a bunch of marks on hard drives and very little money actually changed owners. Already electronic. Already secure. Extremely mobile.
As the article excerpted below states, in 2001 there was about $620 billion dollars in US currency out there somewhere and 65% was in $100 dollar bills.

The $4 trillion doesn't actually go anywhere. It's mostly put up as risk-management and exchange tweaking. Like pork bellies, dig? You buy the options but no truck actually comes and unloads a mound of pork on your front lawn.
Keep in mind that US currency is US Government debt. The more stashed under mattresses, the less debt has to ever be "repaid." As the article mentions, if non-interest bearing currency becomes less popular, then the debt will have to be financed at higher cost through interest-bearing bonds.

The Hague has no jurisdiction over crimes committed in the past due to the "Henry Kissinger" clause insisted upon by the US. Saddam's guilt in a smaller number of deaths is being pushed hard to justify the exercise in the Mid-East so the outcome is certain and will be dressed appropriately I'm sure. My guess is that a suitable Iraqi court won't take note of the number of civilian deaths due to bombings and economic sanctions by its liberators.
