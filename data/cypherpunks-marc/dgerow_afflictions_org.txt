forms) years previous.
My problem lays in the fact that not one person (save Gore himself) can

No, nor was I there for the developing of the blueprints, nor the chopping

building the house.  Just as Gore took initiative in creating -- or rather,
helping to create, or helping to fund the creation of -- the Internet.

continued discussion can't really progress anywhere.  Al Gore munged his

No person who is pushing for SPF believes that it will reduce the volume of
spam.[1]  What SPF *does* do is make it easier to track it down -- the From
address will actually match the domain it was sent from.  This makes the
Abuse department's job *much* easier, as in theory, any spam complaint you
receive about your domain will be *from* your domain.
While this doesn't always mean you have a spammer in your midst, it /does/
mean that the piece of mail in question /did/ come from your networks, hence
it is something you can track down without worry about wasting time that
would be better spent elsewhere.
Arguably, this doesn't gain the anti-spam fighters anything, as the spam
still comes from somewhere.  But if you lay out the seriousness of the
problem to your subscriber, the chances of a repeat offense (which, ideally,
would result in account termination) drop to very close to zero.  This is
also something that ISPs can combat internally, such as forcing SMTP
authentication (which, granted, opens up a whole other bucket of worms), not
allowing outbound SMTP connections (unless explicitly granted), or having
only a web interface to e-mail (thus blocking all outbound SMTP connects,
even to their own mail servers, period).
The 'criminals' aren't necessarily 'steps ahead' -- they're just working
within the SPF framework, and doing exactly what SPF wanted them to do.  SPF
is *one* step towards limiting the volume of spam, but it in and of itself
does not.  There are a great number of other tools that, when combined with
SPF, can and do make a difference in the spam volume being sent.  Yes, each
tool has drawbacks, and I'm not going to claim otherwise.  But for the 95th
percentile, they won't really notice a difference.  Until their account is
cut off, that is.
[1] Any person who claims otherwise just plain doesn't understand SPF or its
goals.  Unfortunately, a few people have claimed that SPF will cut down on
the spam volume, and this take was snapped up by the media and subsequently
pushed out as the primary goal of SPF.  It is, AFAIK, generally agreed that
to cut down on spam volume, we need a whole different protocol from SMTP.

: : These days one has to act very quickly in order to create something : original. The question is, will a TLA do it first and post it, along with a : TINY little ID tag?
I'd do it myself, but I have neither laptop nor wireless networks to test it
Until then, I'll throw it on my "List of Nifty Ideas to Develop".

Thus spake Tyler Durden (camera_lumina [25/03/05 10:30]:
: Has anyone heard of a utility that can search for a WiFi hotspot while : driving and then launch an email?
Someone once said, "Cypherpunks write code."
: In other words, say you want to send out a few anonymous emails, and you : don't even want to enter a Cyber-cafe or whatever. So you load up the : emails in your mail tool and drive down Main Street. The launcher utility : detects the presence of open wi-fi hotspots and belches out a few of the : emails while the spot's in range....all the while you don't even slow down.
: : Sounds possible to me. the only problem might be the need for : authentication, etc...in some hotspots, but given enough hotspots surely : there are some that don't need it...
I imagine that, depending on where you're driving, you wouldn't need to
bother with hotspot authentication: you're bound to stumble onto an open
WiFi network at *some* point in your journey.
Given that there already exists utilities that detect WiFi networks and map
them with GPS units, I don't think it would take much to, at that point,
run, say, 'postfix start && postqueue -f'.  Or perhaps mixmaster/mixminion
might be more appropriate.
It sounds not only possible, but plausible.  And I'd be surprised if someone
didn't already have this working somewhere.

Thus spake Eric Cordian (emc [26/06/07 15:31]:
: 1. Why does the Department of State fail to disclose the real documentation
: requirements on the passport application?
Is it possible that the documentation requested is sufficient for most
purposes, but the government decided, in your friend's case, that more
documentation was needed?
(Is there a 'no-fly' list for passport applicants?)
: 2. Can the government refuse to issue a passport to a US citizen,
: effectively making them a political prisoner, unable to travel, by demanding
: unreasonable documentation, and then filing their passport application in
: limbo if they refuse to provide it or it doesn't exist?
Can they outright refuse?  I don't know.
Can they make demands, calling them 'requirements', that are nigh impossible
to fulfill, resulting in the effective refusal of a passport?  Sure can.
: 3. Is there a way to get a passport without being forced to give the
: government information that is none of their business?
I would be *extremely* surprised if this was possible.

@_subject: Re: what to install on a secure communication device 
libpurple may be a "rat's nest of zero days", but irssi+otr is a nightmare
to get working properly.  I've given up on it, and I've started using
mcabber+otr instead.
bitlbee+otr might be a better choice, and might provide the same network
access as libpurple, with irssi as the interface.  However, I can't comment
as to the usability of such a configuration.
