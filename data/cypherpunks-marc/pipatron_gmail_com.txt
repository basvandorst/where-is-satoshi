What they have gained with the Tor project, and I'm just brainstorming
here because I'm from Sweden and don't know much about the internals
of DoD, is this:
They need a project like Tor as much as "we" do, if not more. They
need ways to communicate with spies and dissidents located all over
the world, they need a system that let their people do this without
causing any suspicion.
With Tor, they have such a tool, and the openess of the software and
source code means that it's more thoroughly tested than they could
ever have done in secret. It is likely that they have a highly
modified version of Tor and that they are watching the Tor project
very carefully as a research project to see the strengths and
weaknesses with such a project.
Planting backdoors in software like this is pretty useless and
ineffective, because you can only use it once. As soon as you act on
information received, there is a very big chance that the backdoor
will be uncovered, Tor will lose all credibility, and no one will ever
again use it for anything that the US would seem interesting.

I think that it's more curious that someone used Tor and didn't know
that it used to be a military research project. Like the internet.
But to be honest, if you don't know anything about programming it
doesn't matter that the source code is available, how are you supposed
to check? Pay someone a ridiculous amount of money to check it for
you? And there's no way to know how many independent programmers have
validated the source code. In a scenario where the military actually
would hide something in the source, all programmers working on the
project would of course be in on it together. There are only a handful
of them.

If the realize or not is irrelevant. They don't care about Tor, most
people don't. They will of course use Tor for whatever purpose they
want, as long as they can do it.

I couldn't find what they mean with "the Netherlands is home to the
largest number of non-malicious and malicious nodes combined" in
Figure 1 on page 8. What differentiate a "malicious node" from a
"non-malicious node"?
Otherwise it wasn't that bad, but the last paragraph is quite offensive:
"In general, networks should be configured to deny access to websites
such as
