Currently I'm working in projects about IT administration. I'm looking for documentation about theory that is backing ldap, (i.e: data structures, trees, discret mathematics, sets, graphs). I have been searching, but I didn't found results. I have been founding information about this concepts but without ldap relation, maybe I don't have the correct keywords. Do you know where I can find information about this?, Thank you very much.
