Company Profile:
BI0GENERICS LTD is a domestic oi| and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a techno|ogy |eader in todays Energy market. The companys shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic 0il and Gas is Bushs  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principal business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, held significant positions in biotechnology, fiber optics and other technology ventures that management believed could propel shareholder value.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oil & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation  an oil and gas techno|ogy |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natura|.
The Companys other holdings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to file a Form 1O in the immediate future.
