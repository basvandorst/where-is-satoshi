Member Name:
Jeffrey Hirsch  New York to London on United Airlines:
“I flew to London to visit
a friend I had met on work/study program in Israel this
past summer. It was perfect timing for the last-minute
special to enable me to spend New Year's in England.
As a complete and utter tourist I visited London, several
castles in Southern England, and Stonehenge--all in one
week”. Overall Experience
Rating: “Excellent! I have plans for an extended
weekend jaunt to Paris.”
