Good news I guess, a small victory.
However I think that is just a simbolic victory, useful only to make more people to become aware about surveillance. With the new technologies and with all the infrastucture already done record and collect the metadata of the phones is too easy, too cheap, too tempting to don't do it. And NSA will continuous doing it.
In the other hand I can understand that the civil libertys groups of US take care of US citizens, but can any american take care of the people of other countrys? We can't legally apeal to any court of US, and we are under US goverment's surveillance too.
