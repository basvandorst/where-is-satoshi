The pretentious beauty of not having a transliteration standard.
Anyway, I won't be convinced that this analogy is government policy until
Assange ends up on the SDN list.

On Tue, Nov 4, 2014 at 6:41 PM, Peter Gutmann Well, it doesn't even have to be that cloak-and-dagger. OFAC and BIS also
tend to make examples in order to enforce policies or demonstrate to
policymakers that 1.) policies as they stand are sufficient, or 2.)
agencies are in line with broader foreign policies of USG.
OFAC and Iran sanctions post-interim agreement might be a more clear
example of this. Some of the biggest fines have occurred in the period when
Congress wanted to escalate or attack the administration for being weak on
Iran. I think Wind River went too far in the eyes of BIS on the Chinese
military deals, and they had to act to ensure that other companies paid
more attention. The timing with the FBI announcements, cancelled
conference, etc. align with this.

I am not confident that distinction exists according to the EAR. I believe
the utilization of third party libraries still leads to the software being
classified under encryption export control when the item is considered an
information security or communications product.
