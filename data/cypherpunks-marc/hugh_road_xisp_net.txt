Dave, If I were to run a meeting as you suggest, it would be MANY
kilometers away from SF and the door Nazi's and consumer slaves of the
DNA.  Most likely I would lock you all in a room and make you watch me
try to make PGP/GPG/OpenPGP work in multiple MUA's and with more then
ONE person at a time for a few hours until even evil, cruel, little
old me could not stand the screams any longer.
  Then after the vans take away the permanently insane I would sit
down and hammer out a design for a replacement to PGP inside no more
then 4 hours.  Obviously none of U.S. is allowed to code it and from
what I can tell today of Linux no one outside the US is fit to code
unix apps at all, so at that point we might just find a fun tall
clif.   So let me get this straight, you have delayed the meeting a week so
that you can not have it?  Have I got that right, that your just doing
dinner which was never part of the meeting?
  Would anyone like to put together a group to learn about how to get
crypto INTO computing systems?  I suggest we have an email and hold
monthly work meetings.  Unlike the cypherpunks...
