     SO, LET'S TALK A LITTLE ABOUT PHEROMONES AND        THEIR      Pheromones are nature's chemical attraction mechanism. Produced       naturally  by most creatures (including humans) these are natures sex         lures.   They are the chemical signals that turn on the sex response         (the  desire to mate) in the opposite sex.             We are all programmed to react to pheromones. It's not a choice, it's
        biological and chemical and pre-programmed into ALL of us.
     You too have seen the effects of sex pheromones, maybe without ever
       realizing it. Most of us have seen first hand the effects of a female
  dog        in "heat" even if the animal is locked up in your house. Male
 dogs in the        neighborhood will escape their homes, jump fences, slip
 their collars and        chains, all in an attempt to get to and mate with
 the dog in heat. It's        pheromones that are causing this reaction (in
 this case of course female        animal pheromones) but the principle is
 the same in humans.             Now for the bad news. Modern evolution and living in a chemically       filled environment has robbed man of the dramatic effect these naturally          occuring chemicals once produced and likewise robbed women of the  ability        to pickup and sense them to a great extent. Oh, we still produce
 them        naturally and like everything else in nature some men produce
 more than        others (ever wonder why some really ugly guys seem to attract
  women with        no difficulty?) So . . . What can we do to restore potent
  levels of these        pheromones? Modern Science to the rescue.           Scientists have been studying and experimenting with isolating and       concentrating pheromones for years. It started years ago as a way to
        attract insects to traps in order to exterminate them. The poor       unsuspecting insects were drawn to "mate" by a concentrated pheromone
         compound instead they get exterminated (how rude) but it worked.
       Eventually scientists got around to isolating and concentrating human   sex        pheromones (thank God not for the same reason) the result.      Androstenone        Pheromone Concentrate.       The amazing and powerful effects of concentrated sex pheromones have        been well documented on many television programs such as Dateline NBC,
         20/20, Hard Copy, and Live With Regis and Kathy Lee to name a few.
     Medical Journals, Magazines,and Several U.S. and Foreign Newspapers
       have all reported the VERY REAL EFFECTS these amazing products
  can        produce.             Now understand, I'm not saying that girls will be beating down your
       door or that they will react in the same way that animals do. But
         they         will react and be subtly "lured" to you.
They may  choose  to sit        in the booth next to you in a restaurant
or choose the seat  next to you in        a theatre or a bar without ever
realizing why they sat there. You'll        probably notice that they will
be friendlier,  smile at you more, make more        eye contact. They will
be more likely  to strike  up a conversation with        you. Or, perhaps
they'll single       you   out to ask directions,        or
help, or advice.  In short they will be  drawn to you and find you more       attractive and  want to be around you  and it won't be your good looks,
or        your great  body, it won't be your  fancy car, or how much money
you make.        It's  just "SOMETHING  " about you that they can't
explain. Like I        said it's chemical. They  Have No Choice.             --- A Note To The Skepical ---      Now to all you skeptics out there. I know that there is nothing I can
        say that will convince you. The only thing that is going to convince   you        is to see it work first hand and the only way you're really going
  to be        convinced is to try it for yourself. Hey, if you weren't interested
  you        wouldn't be reading this to begin with. So be skeptical, that's
  your        right, but give it a chance. Go ahead, laugh when you order
it  (it doesn't        cost that much), laugh when you put it on (you've done
 crazier things),        But I think that in a short while you'll stop laughing
 and start smiling        in fact, you'll be grinning from ear to ear.    This Stuff Works ! ! !      So, get the edge that other men don't have. Place your      ORDER NOW
        and see for yourself. You won't regret it.
