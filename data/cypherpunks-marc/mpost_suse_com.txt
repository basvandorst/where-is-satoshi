It's starting to get difficult to keep track of you lately.  After 30 =
years in one place, now you're job hopping.  :)  I hope things work well =
for both ADP and you.

Hi, Ron,
Glad to hear you're able to retire.  Are you going to actually retire, or =
look for work elsewhere?
It was nice getting to know you via work and at SHARE.  Whatever your =
plans are, I hope you enjoy them.
