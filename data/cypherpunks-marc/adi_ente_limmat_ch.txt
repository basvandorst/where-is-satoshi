Thank you all for your messages. I consider my suggestion as declined.
No wonder... :-)

This story is about a private company and about technology. We talk
about the legal situation. And btw. it is a criminal act to eavesdrop
and to hack into other's systems under Swiss law.

I don't think it is a problem to find a sponsered hosting here in
Switzerland for example. Our law protects citizens from govermental
despotism quite well. National security is not an issue here.
But this is not the question. The question is wether software projects
hosted in the US are still trustworthy because of the legal situation
there. If the pfsense community has the opinion, that it is too risky,
then it is time to start acting. Once this point is reached, me and
others would certainly try to contribute. Most of the people here are
network specialists and do have their connections to hosting
possibilities, I think.

Dear all
After having read the whole NSA thread on this list, it came up to my
mind that pfsense web GUI could declare itself "conform to US laws" upon
the point when there are known backdoors included or otherwise the code
was compromised on pressure of govermental authorities. It would be the
sign for the users to review the code and maybe to fork an earlier
version and host it in a free country, where the protection of personal
data is a common sense and national security is not so much an issue.
