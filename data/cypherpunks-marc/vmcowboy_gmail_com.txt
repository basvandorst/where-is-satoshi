@_subject: Moving On 
I posted this to the VM discussion list earlier today.  Sorry for the
duplication (since many are on both lists).
This month, I will be leaving Nationwide Insurance and taking up work
with Velocity Software.
When I interviewed at Nationwide in late 2005, the company had only
just begun using mainframe Linux for production work.  Of course, it
was all on VM.  Paul Henry (then director over the mainframe team) put
it this way [insert thick Bostonian accent here] - "We're serious
about virtualization.".  And so it is.  Nationwide is a heavy user of
z/VM and Linux on System z (and Linux in general), then as now doing
very cool stuff with V12N and Linux.
Working with Rick Barlow and James Vincent has been the most rewarding
part of the job.  Those of you know know them either from the VM or
zLinux communities or from SHARE can only imagine what has been my
reality for the past four and one half years. And the team around us
(whom most of you do not know) is phenominal: the most committed group
I have thus far been privileged to be a part of. I will miss them.
But now the time has come for me to go back to the development world,
supporting the software that makes virtualization actually work.  If
you can't measure it ... well, you know.  So I am elated that on the
20th I'll start with Velocity, a company I have always respected with
products of renown.  I am stoked!
