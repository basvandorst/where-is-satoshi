It's not clear that he said that. He was sufficiently evasive to so many
questions, that there are lots of ways to put it back together. It's also
not clear what sort of threat his software poses. Does it do OS attacks,
degradation? We just don't know what he means.

2009/10/21 Eugen Leitl I don't think that Sinn Fein enjoyed the death and fear that was the result
of IRA actions either. However, they shared a belief in a more unified
Ireland, much as 'pirates' and Piratpartiet share a belief in more
reasonable copyright laws, and execution, as well as a variety of other
electronic and surveillance freedom issues. If you think that what I said
was slanderous, you may be interpreting more of a normative view than I was
trying to espouse.

2009/10/21 grarpamp I don't really want to stretch this analogy too far, and I certainly don't
think that it's reasonable to compare people who obtain, share and
distribute media in ways often suggested to violate local laws; with an
organised group of armed political activists/terrorists who killed many in
bombings. Nonetheless, wouldn't Piratpartiet already be the Sinn Fein
(completely legitimate political arm) to the massive group of sometimes
self-identified pirates (the legally dubious underground organisation)?

Looks like a bunch of gibberish to me; and not very good gibberish at that.
hIf The Internet
is restricted in such ridiculous ways as Kaspersky suggests, then
other internets will just spring up to replace it.
For those who don't know, such a project already exists, run by
Freaknet: Netsukuku is very interesting.
It's also very difficult to tell whether it is gibberish or not:
