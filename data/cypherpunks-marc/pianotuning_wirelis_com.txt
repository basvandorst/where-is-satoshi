I hope you don't mind me writing you. I came across your e-mail address after looking around some web sites local to me and thought I'd ask if you personally  in need of a professional piano tuner or might know of someone you could forward this e-mail to.
I'm tuning for donations until I build-up a customer base in the area so payment is whatever you can afford.
I'll travel to the Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura and the Orange County areas.
Here's a map of where I live in Glendora in case you'd like to know:
