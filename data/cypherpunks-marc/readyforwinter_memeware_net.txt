jews are race-mixed Afro-asiatic mongrels, the ones who aren't converts.
Hebrew is an Afro-asiatic language. And din't you know the true jews are
black israelites.
The majority of crimes in the US, Australia, and Europe are committed by
genetic Europeans because the majority of the population are genetic
Europeans. What kind of nigger-tier logic are you using. 'Per-capita' is
the measurement context you are looking for.

persistently harassed by strangers, authorities, and anonymous hackers
in very misleading and often abusive ways.
Interesting observation; is it accurate ? It seems like all these claims
are bullshit and simple noia, unless you travel abroad to non-free
caliphate states like in Europe. The feds can run disruption campaigns
against anybody they want but yet nobody bothers me. Maybe the trick is
to not be a snitch like John or Julian, even if the content they share
should have never been secret to begin with; the public are essentially
the board members of their govt and have the right to know everything
done with their money and/or in their name/interest.
Share them here, please.

"9/11 Papers" MegaLeak - Layer 1 + Checkpoint 03, 04, 05, 06, & 07:
Cyber-Cash For Cyber-Cache
This is the thedarkoverlord here to deliver a message.
We're now calling this megaleak, the '9/11 Papers'. Keep giving us
cyber-cash for cyber-cache.
Hello, world. As you're well-aware, we designed a compensation plan that
would allow for the public crowd-funding of our organisation in order to
permit the public disclosure of our "9/11 Papers" in the interest of the
public. Part of this plan was to create a tiered escalation plan that
would result in multiple layers and milestones (which we're calling
checkpoints) to ensure the powers at be are being properly bent over a
barrel. We've said it before, and we'll say it again: we're financially
motivated, and you (the public) has spoken to us in our language
(internet money, specifically Bitcoin). Through voicing your
satisfaction by sending us 3.27 BTC for a total of over 12.000 USD of
BTC (at the time of writing), you've successfully unlocked Layer 1 as
well as Checkpoint 03, Checkpoint 04, Checkpoint 05, Checkpoint 06, and
Checkpoint 07. As with our previous paid releases, we've demonstrated to
you that we're honest about our intentions and we're transparent. As a
result of this most magnificent achievement, we're continuing to follow
the wishes of the public by releasing the Layers and Checkpoints we
promised you we would. Remember, continuing to fund our wallet will
continue to keep us motivated to help break the truth to the world by
open-sourcing what we're calling the "9/11 Papers". As such, let the
leaking continue:
Layer 1 = 500 Files
Checkpoint 05 = 50 Files
Checkpoint 06 = 50 Files
Checkpoint 07 = 50 Files
TOTAL = 650 Files

Instructions to decrypt the containers - Download Veracrypt and use the
decryption key above.
If you don't have our previously released 'Preview_Documents.container'
key, it is here:
Transparency Disclaimer: Checkpoint 03 and Checkpoint 04 would have been
comprised of documents from Layer 1, but since the single donation
covered past Layer 1, we're releasing Layer 1 as an aggregate of itself
along with Checkpoint 03 and Checkpoint 04.
Let this serve as more definitive proof that what we're saying is true,
and that we're doing exactly as we promised you. Continue to keep the
bitcoins flowing, and we'll continue to keep the truth flowing.
Remember, Cyber-Cash for Cyber-Cache. We hope that there'll be more
releases. Continue to share these download links and decryption keys on
Reddit, 4chan, Steemit, Voat, your siblings, your friends, your pets,
and anyone else! We can't allow the mainstream media to silence the
truth any longer. We must ensure they're propaganda is crushed by the
truths we're dealing today.
Stay tuned on PasteBin for future announcements related to this leak.
We'll always sign all of our releases for verification of authenticity.

As the world is aware, we released our first decryption key for the
'Preview_Documents.container' Veracrypt container that contained a small
sample of documents to continue to verify the authenticity of our
claims. The decryption key for this container is:
There's five layers to go. Layer 1, 2, 3, 4, and fine finally Layer 5.
Each layer contains more secrets, more damaging materials, more SSI,
more SCI, more government investigation materials, and generally just
more truth. Consider our motivations (money, specifically Bitcoin),
we're not inclined to leak the juiciest items until we're paid in full.
However, in the interest of public awareness and transparency, we're
officially announcing our tiered compensation plan. Below, we'll
announce the required cost to release each layer of damaging documents
that are filled with new truths, never before seen. There's only one way
we can be paid: Bitcoin. There's two ways for you to pay us: you can
acquire BTC on your own and send it to our address and build the pool
directly, or you can bundle into groups and communities and create
GoFundMe pages that collect large amounts of fiat that can then be
converted, by the community leader, and used to purchase BTC to throw
into our wallet address. As more BTC is generated, more information will
be released. We're also going to introduce checkpoints between each
major funding goal that will result in some small samples to be released
from the next layer before the entire layer is allowed to be decrypted.
Our compensation structure follows:
Preview_Documents.container - Free, we released the key to prove
authenticity of our claims.
Checkpoint 01 - 250 USD of BTC = 25 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 02 - 500 USD of BTC = 25 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 03 - 750 USD of BTC = 40 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 04 - 1.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Layer_1.container - 5.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 1 Documents)
Checkpoint 05 - 6.500 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 06 - 8.500 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 07 - 12.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 08 - 25.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Layer_2.container - 50.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents)
Checkpoint 09 - 65.000 USD of BTC = 100 'random' documents from Layer 3.
Checkpoint 10 - 85.000 USD of BTC = 100 'random' documents from Layer 3.
Layer_3.container - 100.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents)
Checkpoint 11 - 250.000 USD of BTC = 250 'random' documents from Layer 4.
Checkpoint 12 - 500.000 USD of BTC = 250 'random' documents from Layer 4.
Layer_4.container - 1.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 4 Documents)
Checkpoint 13 - 1.500.000 USD of BTC = 5 'random' documents from Layer 5.
Layer_5.container - 2.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 5 Documents)
To clarify this structure, if we reach 10.000 USD of BTC, we'll release
the 'Layer_1.container' decryption key to the public via our official
Twitter. If another 90.000 USD of BTC is donated (for a total of 100.000
USD of BTC at this point), we'll release the decryption key for
'Layer_2.container' via our official Twitter, and so on. The
compensation is compounding structure, with the totals to be calculated
from the deposits into the BTC address time of their deposits.
We have a long history of trustworthy negotiations and resolutions with
many clients of ours. It's our goal to be financially compensated before
we initiate any brazen actions. You're motivated by your passions for
the truth, and we're motivated by our passion and love for Bitcoin.
Let's come to together and meet in the middle.
Our Official Bitcoin Wallet Address: 192ZobzfZxAkacLGmg9oY4M9y8MVTPxh7U
We've publicly released the archive of the 911 World Trade Center
Litigation documents publicly. There's thousands of files included in
the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive and we would
encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted using a very
strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will prevent
anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we publicly
release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between five
layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the most
heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and Layer
4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage
everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may
publicly release keys for each of these containers if our requests from
the involved companies are not met. The link to download the 10 GB
archive is below. Stay tuned for the possible release of more decryption
keys. We may release these keys on our new official Twitter page
( and/or on the dark web hacker forum 'KickAss'.
Below is the link to the torrent file to download the archive. The SHA1
Hash is calculated from '911_Archive.zip'.

And finally, a message to the companies directly involved to include the
airlines, government agencies, the dozens of solicitor firms, the
insurers, and the many others, this is a message directly to you: pay
the fuck up, or we're going to bury you with this. If you continue to
fail us, we'll escalate these releases by releasing the keys, each time
a Layer is opened, a new wave of liability will fall upon you. You know
our contact details.
You're welcome, heathens and what's the final lesson? When you're a
client of ours and you've accepted an agreement of ours: follow it to
the letter. We're not motivated by any political thoughts. We're not
hacktivists. We're motivated only by our pursuit of internet money

We're now calling this megaleak, the '9/11 Papers'. Keep giving us
cyber-cash for cyber-cache.
We delivered Checkpoint 01 as promised, and now we're taking it upon
ourselves to dive a bit deeper into this 9/11 Papers Megaleak by
releasing our official Checkpoint 02 release as we've now reached
Checkpoint 02 due to another generous doner! Instead of choosing 25
random files from Layer 1, we chose 25 random files from the other
higher layers. What's in these files? We'll tell you briefly:
Highly confidential settlement documents
Highly confidential FBI interviews with involved persons
Highly confidential e-mails
Highly confidential judicial orders
Highly confidential sensitive security information
Highly confidential TSA, FBI, FAA files
Let this serve as more definitive proof that what we're saying is true,
and that the parties involved should comply, before this gets worse.
Enjoy the highly confidential data. Ensure to view the e-mail message
attachments. They're delicious and juicy. Continue to send us money and
continue to receive these documents.

Our reward: internet money, your reward: 9/11 secret documents, never
before seen by the public. Your money is unlocking the truth and

United States law enforcement agencies have attempted to silence us from
our releases by requesting Twitter to suspend our account. An appeal to
Twitter has gone unanswered. We'd like everyone to know that we're still

we have them.
