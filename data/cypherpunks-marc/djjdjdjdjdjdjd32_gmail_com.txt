Any yooha can stick PHP on their resume and get a job writing web
applications. Personally I mark the problem down as sheer incompetence on
the side of the developers.
There really should be more focus on demanding higher quality software.
But I guess this is a very general problem across many industries; that
which saves us a little bit of money today is more important than the long
term benefit of the wider organisation, environment, society etc.

Blocking Tor does not change the fact that you have an SQLi vulnerability
(or whatever).
The problem is not Tor but the logic that dictates it is easier and cheaper
to ban a few IP addresses than to actually secure your shit.
