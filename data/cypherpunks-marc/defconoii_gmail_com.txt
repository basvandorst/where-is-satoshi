i would imagine that the NSA and GCHQ would try and hack and access as many
High bandwidth entry and exit nodes as possible, if unable to hack im sure
they would monitor the connection from the ISP.  In the case of tormail
they were trying to get anyone and everyone's ip address, im sure every ip
address gathered from that site is monitored and kept an eye on.  Sure they
have a few "targeted only attacks" but in general they need to deanonymize
a large portion of the network so they can pinpoint their attack on a
specific target.  I think anyone who uses Tor is a target, I prefer to use
it over vpn to my tor usage is not pointed back to my ISP.  Also those whom
used Tor on their router or a VPN on their router wouldnt be effected by a
browser exploit identifying their real ip unless it used CSS to login to
your router and pull your ISP ip, but thats what logins and passwords are

happy to see that they have not cracked TOR encryption and the anonymity of
it.  We need to focus more on secure browsers and tools that work over TOR
since they are relying on browser exploits and hacking services on TOR.  I
also think more people should consider being an entry and exit node on the
TOR network, we dont want the NSA getting the majority of TOR nodes, if
they do they can deanonymize it further.  Thanks for the share.
