Excuse me, I meant the server host, not VPN, in my reply.

Sure they do. The VPN was clearly not in the US and they used agreements to access it (it is mentioned in the affidavit).

I would assume they were digging into the origins of the Silk Road, tracking down references as you quote below. It isn't clear how they actually got his name and if they had it before customs intercepted him importing fake IDs. The paperwork claims that this was a random customs check but that could easily be misinformation and they had his name on a list or somesuch.

SL (or derivatives) would get a lot more users if the tech used didn't
look like video games circa 2002. It is so ugly, broken, and clumsy that
I and others I know who were using it for online meetings quickly left.

Sounds like you need a better and more efficient system for consuming

Until tomorrow, when he does it againand the next dayand the next day. He seems to feel this list is his fawning crowd of adoration that cares about his personal fights with whomever he is fighting this week.
Im here because I care about crypto and security. I enjoy the posts of links to articles, videos, news items, or actual discussion of these issues but, seriously, this isnt the Bell Fanclub, is it?

Your mechanism for breaking Tor since that paper apparently contains all that you need to do so. Quick, show us your work or are you just some guy bitching on the Internet?
