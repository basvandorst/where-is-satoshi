Not true, the comment was moderator approved. The only reason we have
moderation at all is because spam significantly outnumbers legit
comments and we don't want any spam on any of our sites, there isn't
some vast conspiracy going on.
No, we have not been approached by anyone to backdoor or otherwise
compromise security of the project, at any point during our 9 year
I have indeed met with the NSA in person related to the product of one
of our rebrand customers a couple years back, one of their groups was
interested in evaluating the product. It survived their security
analysis quite well (at least from what they declassified and
released), and better than most things that come into their lab from
what I understand. At no point did any discussion happen related to
back doors or other means of compromising security for them. I wasn't
under NDA nor do I have a security clearance.
It is effectively a moot question to ask, given if we were, there's no
way we could disclose that. Evidence suggests a number of huge tech
companies have complied. There hasn't been any evidence to date that
any open source projects were approached. A number of widely-respected
security people have come out and said that open source solutions are
better in the aftermath of the recent revelations. One example:
"My guess is that most encryption products from large US companies
have NSA-friendly back doors, and many foreign ones probably do as
well. It's prudent to assume that foreign products also have
foreign-installed backdoors. Closed-source software is easier for the
NSA to backdoor than open-source software." -Bruce Schneier
On crypto-related components, we rely on what's in stock FreeBSD.
There are no indications it has been weakened or compromised.
