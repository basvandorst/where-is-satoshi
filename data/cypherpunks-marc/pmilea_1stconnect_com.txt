Dear Sir or Madam,	                   I am an international broker and I deal in Crude Oil and Fiber Optic Cable ,as well as gold. I am very frustrated with the international brokers that insist they have crude oil allocations and do not. I have a very large international clientele who are buyers of crude oil. I am attempting to locate Light Crude Oil for them. My clients will  move immediately ,in the form  Of a letter of credit ,upon proof that the product exists and is yours to sell.I will refuse any email that does not address proof of product. 	 Please ,do not call me or contact me unless you can produce proof that you have product to sell.Presently, these buyers urgently demand to fill the  2 contracts listed below. We are also interested in spot deals. If you can provide offers similar to the terms and conditions listed herein, we can immediately  expedite the transaction. In both offers they are requesting SLCO but they have interest in any light crude oil deals that  are genuine.	I represent seven refineries, at this time ,and they desire that I scrutinize all  offers before it reaches them. I am looking for proof of product so that we can verify that  you have allocations for crude oil. If you can not provide this, please do not waste my time  and yours.  I will not approach my clientele with a promise. I need proof that you have Crude oil allocations to sell .If you can do this I have been assured that the LC can be opened immediately.I can provide a letter of intent to purchase and mandation papers for the seller.I am not looking for somone to shop for this product for me . I am looking for someone who has the product and the authority to make a deal.
