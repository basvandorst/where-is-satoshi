@_subject: Daniel Lange & Debian: DebConf, aggression towards volunteers 
Does anybody have any facts about Daniel Lange?
What is really remarkable is that Debian ignored this evidence and began
processing Lange's application to become a Debian Developer in the same
week that they were expelling Jacob Appelbaum
The arrogance and hypocrisy knows no limits

Hi all,
I've supported a few applications in the newmaint list and I never objected
one. With Daniel Lange's declaration of intent I feel for the first time the
need to publically do some considerations, but I don't know the best way
to proceed.
I'd like to make it clear that his behavior in some situations in the past
are not welcome in Debian. At the same time I don't want to start a noisy
thread in there.
I witnessed aggressive and disrespectful behavior from Daniel against a
very close to me, both written and in person, during Debconf15. As he
was not a
member/whatever of the Debian community I decided to let it go. Besides
that, I
think he was quite harmful during the storm against the Debconf chairs.
But it
may be more a personal opinion.
I'm aware that he's doing a lot of work for Debconf and I'm not objecting to
his application. But I'll just feel bad if I say nothing at this time.
Any suggestion on how to act will be appreciate on such situations.

@_subject: fsfellowship.eu subscription/censorship problems 
After the earlier post, some people tried to subscribe at
gmail is bouncing many subscription confirmation emails back to the list
admin address (see below)
There is also anecdotal evidence that these gangsters have been working
away behind the scenes to lobby Hacker News, Slashdot, Twitter and
Reddit to automatically flag or censor any links to any article at these
* * These links are also being censored from all forums and Discourse sites
using Akismet anti-spam, site admins sometimes have to manually approve
any post or comment containing these links.
If all this isn't a fascist conspiracy, what is?  These are the people
who bent over backwards to fill the web with false rape allegations
about Jacob Appelbaum but they do everything to hide discussions about
their own acts of harassment and fraud against volunteers.
Some ways around these fascists:
* stop using gmail
* follow the RSS feed  directly
* make stickers:
