Remember not everyone who is on this list is a network operator  and sometimes their misguided statements make it here. Do  not get me wrong I wish wikileaks would disappear, but there are better ways to do this than interfering with other peoples networks. I would hope  the moderators are willing to take the correction action when addressing such matters.
