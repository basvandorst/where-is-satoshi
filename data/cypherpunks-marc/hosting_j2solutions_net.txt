RHEN != RHN.  RHN isn't the RHN it used to be, where enterprise and desktop play together.  There are 2 services now, RHEN for Enterprise systems, and RHN for desktop/rhlp systems.  Please don't confuse the two services, and expect the same out of both.
Here's a thought.  Assign your entitlements to released products.  Then they aren't being "wasted".  It's a beta for god sakes.  If you don't want to participate in the beta process, which may or may not populate RHN with stuff, then don't.  Put your release product back on and feel good about having used your entitlements.  Hell, dual boot the box so you can boot back to your released product and look at the shiny blue check icon.

You do realize that yum itself is in Red Hat rawhide, and all indications point that it will be included in the next beta and in the final release.  So "adding brokeness" will be a good thing since you'll be testing it out.  Yum is quite unbroken from my tests and I think it's a really good thing that it's being added to the distro.
