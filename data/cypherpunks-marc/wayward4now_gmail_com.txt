Would using a second sound card just for skype work?

============================== START ==============================
I just found this tonight... as I was looking back over old posts on
Skype. Damn thing 'made' easy enough from the tarball... this is version 0.5 so
it might be a little risky!! But it generates that asound.conf file
after you run through a rather large gui-picklist of a lot of options.
As long as it doesn't BLOW THINGS UP, it looks like a contender. Debian
and Suse have 'also-tools-gui', and we don't, it seems.  kasound
just might be helpful, YMMV, Ric
