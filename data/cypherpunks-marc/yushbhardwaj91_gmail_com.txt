@_subject: US or Europe 
Yesterday I had a debate that US is Worst or Europe when it comes to
monitoring and tracking.
For tracking Europe is best but when it comes to monitoring, noone can beat
US because government spies on their citizens as well.
Anyone give me any resources where I can read or know more about it.
I was told to watch Snowden movie, except that anything any of you know?
