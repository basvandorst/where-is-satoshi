Well, the "bar" started at something as trivial as FireSheep.  And I'm
sure many more silly (in retrospect) exploits remain to be discovered in
any cloud-based infrastructure (the bigger the cloud, the bigger the
target, the greater the potential damages/losses).
And a lot of infrastructure remains vulnerable to something as trivial
as FireSheep.
