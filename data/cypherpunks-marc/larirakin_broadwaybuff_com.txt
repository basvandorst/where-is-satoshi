This site will save you alot of money on meds... W I Drop me: The lecturer on evolution had been going on for nearly two hours. then he
started again, and said he:"Let me ask the evolutionist a question --- if we
had tails like a baboon, where are they?""I'll venture an answer, " said an
old lady. "We have worn them off sitting here so long.".
A woman has twins, and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to a
family in Egypt, and is named "Amal." The other goes to a family in Spain;
they name him "Juan."Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his
mom. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wishes she
also had a picture of Amal. Her husband responds, "But they are twins--if
you've seen Juan, you've seen Amal."
