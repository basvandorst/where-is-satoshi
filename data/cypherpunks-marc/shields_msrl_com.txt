I agree this is the general direction, but I think there are some
major exceptions; for example, the doctrine of prior restraint was not
established in court until 1931.

For perspective, however, current-model Palms have 33 MHz Motorola 68k
processors, which used to be considered a nice desktop CPU.  In 1991,
when PGP was first released, the Mac Classic II had a 16 MHz 68030 and
2 MB of RAM.  If that was enough for PGP, then a Palm m500 ought to be
capable of it also.
Granted, you will want to use longer keys now.  But the hardware in
your pocket can do more crypto than you might think.  And they're only
getting faster.

Most of the security features of a dollar bill are not directed
toward the serial number; they are designed to prevent changing the
denomination, or to increase the cost of creating a real-looking bill
from scratch.  Changing the serial number is likely to be fairly
For this to be secure, you would have to keep the serial number a
secret; and in that case, the paper could be any piece of paper with
a secret written on it.
But of course.

It is not yet in the mainline Linux kernel, but implementations are

Only because Joe Burglar doesn't yet have the tools to crack the weak
encryption on this device.  Joe Burglar now has tools to break the
"password protection" on word processor and other files, and if this
new device becomes at all popular, then tools to crack it will become
readily available.  It's only a matter of time.

Please read the paper.  What's sent is not a picture of the token, but
a hash of a picture of the pattern produced by a laser shining through
the token.  Because the laser scatters through the token in three
dimensions it is difficult to model or reproduce the token.  By
varying the angle of the laser you can produce a large number of
possible patterns, too many to be stored -- it's claimed this can be
as much as 7 TB of data.  So you can have a useful level of security
even with untrusted token readers, and an extremely high level of
security with trusted token readers.

If you do that, you have to rely on both the Google URL not changing
