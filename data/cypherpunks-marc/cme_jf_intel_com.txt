then I see two major problems:
1.	the PKI vendors aren't financial institutions, so they aren't in a
position to assume risk and make money from that
2.	the current PKI thinking (e.g., with "rebuttable presumption of
non-repudiation") is anti-consumer, when viewed as a financial
mechanism, and I can't imagine that succeeding even if the vendors
were banks.

That is certainly true today, but that is precisely how users decide whether or not to give up their credit card numbers or more sensitive information.  It's a good thing that the user is absolved of liability in case the credit card is stolen.  I disagree that it's not possible to secure logos.  It's a MMOP (mere matter of programming). :)

There is no certificate issued by Palm to Modus Media granting it authority to do business in Palm's name.  There is only a certificate by VeriSign to the effect that Modus Media has been granted permission to use SSL server authentication for the domain name store.palm.com.  Meanwhile, the information that the user really looks at to make a security decision (the Palm logo and the little padlock) aren't related at all.

Of course you do.  That's why  is such a problem.  You thought you were talking to (and wanted to talk to) Palm Computing, just like the logos and page layout said you were.  You're not.  You're talking to a MITM.  Palm hired them to run the store?  The certificates don't say that.
Actually, Eric, the third party might confuse that for you.  The function it performs with respect to naming is not totally unlike the function of early anonymizers.  The TTP chooses a name to bind to the public key that might have only a tenuous relation to the name by which you know the keyholder.  As a result, when you do a name comparison between the certificate Subject and what you know about this person, "the person you think it does", you may have to make a guess about whether the match is correct.
Here we spend all this effort to reduce the probability of error, in the cryptography, to values like 2^{-128} and then make the security decision depend just as much on a guess with a much greater probability of error.  From the point of view of error probability, we should have left out the cryptographic part entirely.

P.S. the workshop where we should (and probably will) be discussing this is  and there are still two weeks before papers are due.

You're right.  That was a nice feature of SDSI, but I have see no call for it either, and I probably would before you would.
What we do see a strong need for is naming semantics of the form 'the person who I call jim'.
