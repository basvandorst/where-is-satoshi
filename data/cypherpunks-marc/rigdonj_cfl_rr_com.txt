You may be right but I thought I should warn everyone. I'll forward the
complete message to you directly along with the expanded headers. Maybe you
can figure out where it came from.

Hi All,
  I just got the message below from my ISP (Road Runner).  It appears that
a message from the CC List contained Zafi.B worm.  I've just spent TWO+
days installing a new hard drive and reloading all my software after
getting some DoS piece of crap that I couldn't remove from the old HD.
