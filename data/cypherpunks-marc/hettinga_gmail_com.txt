Right. And nothing is new. I cite *novel* stuff in every occurrence, outlining actual human *progress*, and you go all relativistic and say theyâre derivative. Fine. Derivative of what, exactly? What was the Roman lateen sail derivative of if there had not been a triangular sail before, for instance.
What is Zenoâs paradox, say, derivative of? The Pythagorean theorem? Heroâs steam turbine?
There *is* an arrow to progress. It is measurable. The arrow of islamic culture points in completely the opposite direction. The leftâs anti-western urge to annihilate progress, and thus humanity, is striking in its tenacity.

ObPedantry: Anselm was not an Arab, his reductive "proof of god" as perfect" parlor trick notwithstanding.
There were *no* Arab philosophers, much less "really smart" ones. Avicenna, for instance, was Persian, and like most Arab-conquered middle eastern types by then, regurgitated earlier Greek text using Indian astronomy math, including the zero, finance, (the foreign exchange contract, the letter of credit, and the demand-deposit check, say), and science. A bare fraction of which was actually saved by rampaging Islamic Arab rapine, physical, intellectual, and otherwise. There were *copies*, even better ones, of the contents of the Library at Alexandria, all over the ancient middle east, and even after it was burned by both Ceasar and a Bishop or two, it was the Muslims who actually burned its entire contents. And all the other libraries besides.
Averroes, another leading Arab philosophical light, was a Spaniard. And an Aristotelian. So no new philosophy there, either. All of Arab contributions to civilization were derivative. The lateen sail was Roman (Lateen, geddit?), for instance. Damascus steel was Indian wootz steel.
The Arabs' principal accomplishment, if you can call it that, was destroying the ancient world wherever they went, and replacing it with abject barbarism for most of a thousand years. Their piracy in the Mediterranean killed trade between east and west, (and north and south) for the entirety of their command of it and was the proximal cause of the Dark Ages in the West. Their contribution to philosophy, if one could call it that, was to declare, after they got sick of listening to Persians and Egyptians prattle badly-regurgitated Greek for a century or so, that *nothing* happens without gods will, which obviated the need for cause and effect at all. You struck two stones together, and god *decided* that there would be a spark, you see. Which is how the world got blessed with Sharia law and all the rest of Islams barbaric world view.
As long as there can be nothing unless God wills it, there can be no Islamic science. At least the Orthodox and the Catholics had to somehow incorporate cause and effect into their view of the world, or there would not be any sin. Seeding their own intellectual demise, at least, at the hands of the scientific method later on.
In the west, philosophy was made the handmaiden of theology for more than fifteen hundred years. For a thousand of those years, philosophy in Islam was a shit-house slave.
Philosophy didnt actually occur in the west until Newton figured out how to use mathematics to deal with infinity in order to calculate the motion of objects. Discovered *again*, apparently. Palimpsests have been recovered from Orthodox codices made of scraped-over scrolls containing Archimedes (who else? :-)), dealing in infinitesimals, at least, if not the actual epsilons and deltas which finally nailed calculus to mathematical terra-firma by Bolzano in 1817. After Newton, a veritable festival of philosophical navel-gazing began in the West after, with the possible exception of the Stoics and Cynics, almost two thousand years. All to collapse again after Godel proved he was his own grandpa. Or, at least, he *could*, Groucho, belong to a club that would have him as a member.
And, of course, Existentialism, like Freudianism, is merely literature. Okay. Freudianism is really *bad* literature, with Freud conflating Oedipus with Hamlet. Besides, being, you know, proven to be unfalsifiable pseudoscience, in the same breath that Karl Popper took it out with Marxism in the 1950s. Existentialism isnt even that. Its another example of Eric Raymonds "Gramscian Damage: .

Information that is only valuable because of book-entry transaction settlement, by the way. Like, say, (for the current generation of ancom cypherpunks, who donât know commerce from the dictatorship of the proletariat) checks, credit cards, and, yes, bitcoin. The blockchain is merely :-) a cryptographically secure inviolate public ledger, remember. It may be possible to hide transactions there, but I wouldnât bet my life on it.
Because we *need* biometricly-provable is-a-physical-person and-then-you-go-to-jail-if-you-lie identity in order for transactions to even execute, much clear and settle, weâve created an entire industry based on the leftover information exhaust, dovetailing nicely with our former practice of massive industrial production runs of exactly identical goods, and thus the transfer-pricing of ostensibly marketable (as in free exchange, not as in advertising) assets, now migrated to the internet with a vengeance, to be used as evidence against us in a court of law, Arlo.
Instantaneously-settled transactions, like, say, with blind signatures, which, not coincidentally, required no counterparty identity to function, only a linked list of expired certificates, only readable at the time of double spending, is why I joined the original cypherpunks list to begin with. In 1994. Weâve been at this a long time. At the time, I had digital good that I could email to someone, like say, Oak Ridge Labs, but they could only send me a paper purchase order by return mail. Which I then had to reply to that purchase order, by mail, with a paper invoice, which they would then send me a paper check, also in the mail, which would then clear. Within five business days. Usually.
So now weâre learning, in increasingly intimate detail, something I first observed in public at the last Financial Cryptography Conference I went to, almost ten years ago: the closer you get to T-0 transaction settlement you get, the more dangerous identity-based finance becomes.
And thatâs also why I still say that financial cryptography is the only cryptography that matters.

Depends on if youâre a Marxist and think that money steals power, or an anarchist and thinks that power steals money. The latter grabs the market-elephant blindly, the former sucks giant donkey dicks in the Tijuana Donkey show of force, fraud, and plunder.
As an example of what Peter might have been alluding to, Pompey and Julius were rich Roman guys who got richer in the conquering trade, Pompey going east after pirates and then eastern kings, and Julius going after, well, Gaul, actually. And then, you know, Rome, after that.
But, like I said, itâs older than that. Since people started staying in one place in middle Anatolia about 12-18,000 years ago, about five thousand years before they actually started cultivating the wheat they were harvesting every year and moving out from there down the Tigris and Euphrates and Nile and out into Fair Europa, all farmers -- and then mechanics -- since have been subject to the depredations of former hunter-gatherers who plundered them for their âsurplusâ assets. And priestly former scavengers who told them lies of pie in the sky when they die to justify the actions of the guys who, you know, beat the fuck out of you if you didnât pay up.
Because, like dogs, and hyenas, they could.
Now the priests are academics, the media, and legislative politicians. The Hunter/gatherers are either professional military (mostly harmlessâ¦) or plundering proto-warlord aristocrats like, come to think of it, all four current extant presidential hopefuls, and the current occupant of Adamsâ Edifice. There. Howâs that?

The Register
GNU cryptocurrency aims at 'the mainstream economy not the black market'
GNU and an outfit called âInriaâ have released Alpha code â version 0.0.0 to be precise â of an anonymous-but-taxable electronic payments system they say is âa currency for the mainstream economy, and not the black market.â
âTalerâ, as the effort is dubbed, looks to be an attempt to build on the concepts behind Bitcoin. So while Taler lets you use encrypted âcoinsâ as a means of exchange, it is explicitly not a new currency. Instead, it â... uses an electronic exchange holding financial reserves in existing currencies.â
âThis means that Taler is not a new currency with the inherent currency fluctuation risks, but instead the cryptographic coins correspond to existing currencies, such as US Dollars, Euros or even BitCoins.â
The technology is also designed to be open enough that governments can peer inside, levy âsales, value-added or income taxesâ.
As a GNU project, the code is of course freely-available.
For now, the effort is in its very early stages. GNU even warns, in the announcement of the project's debut, that âThere is no auditor, and hence components do not properly support auditors either. As a result, a dishonest exchange could embezzle funds.â There's also no real-world integration at present, âso only toy currencies are available for now.â
If you're interested regardless of those foibles, the 0.0.0 code does include âkey components providing logic for running a bank, exchange, merchant and wallet.â That code is described as follows:
Inria and GNU hope to have more advanced versions of Taler to share by year's end.
When they do, it may well be game on in the cryptocurrency space: Taler's already used fighting words with its âmainstream, not black marketâ talk. Bitcoin's many admirers may take offence at that kind of language and point to strong adoption. Sceptics can point to security woes among Bitcoin exchanges, governance woes and the cryptocurrency's volatility as evidence that different approaches to electronic currencies probably won't hurt their evolution.

work on nuclear weapons. The team specially selected to write it were =
persons with a history of advocating leniency to Iran. Nor is this bias =
new: In 1950, CIA weighed in against General Douglas MacArthur on Korea =
policy both within the U.S. government and by supplying material for =
columns against his views by the New York Times=E2=80=99s James Reston.
The CIA=E2=80=99s bias is not mere incompetence. For more than a =
decade=E2=80=94during which, thanks to the treason of its own Aldrich =
Ames, the entire U.S. agent network in Moscow was under KGB =
control=E2=80=94CIA analysts still passed the =E2=80=9Ctake=E2=80=9D =
from that network to the president because, according to the Inspector =
General=E2=80=99s report, the analysts thought that the president should =
be acting as if these reports were true.
This is the same CIA that insisted for years that the GDP of East =
Germany=E2=80=94where whole families used to have to share a single tea =
bag and bananas were luxuries=E2=80=94was equal to that of West Germany, =
and that the Soviet Union=E2=80=99s ratio of military spending to GDP =
was the same as America=E2=80=99s. It was at least five times ours.
All of this is to say that, as regards strategic intelligence, CIA is =
usually worse than useless. For tactical intelligence, it is largely =
irrelevant. Intercepts of foreign communications are the one most useful =
source of tactical intelligence. NSA and the military do that. CIA often =
gets in the way of the military=E2=80=99s own needs for intelligence. =
Over the years, CIA has successfully lobbied Congress to prevent the =
military services from developing their own human collection networks, =
despite the fact that CIA=E2=80=99s own human assets are almost =
completely irrelevant to military needs.
Probably the only good result of the =E2=80=9Cwar on terror=E2=80=9D has =
been the Army=E2=80=99s and Marines=E2=80=99 forced resumption of =
responsibility for their own Intelligence, although restricted to the =
places where they must fight. The military services were always better =
equipped for human Intelligence because their officers=E2=80=94but =
especially their enlisted=E2=80=94are far more diverse racially, more =
versatile linguistically, and incomparably more accepting of personal =
risk than CIA=E2=80=99s case officers. The disparity is such that, in =
the early 2000s, CIA simply took over Army personnel, individually and =
as units, and used them for infiltrations of various kinds that its own =
people could not do and would not risk.
What, then, is CIA good for?
Its founding myth combines a historical falsehood with reference to =
technical circumstances that have not existed for at least a generation.
In 1947 and since, CIA=E2=80=99s advocates have argued that the surprise =
of Pearl Harbor happened because=E2=80=94although the information to =
indicate that Japan would attack Hawaii at 7am on December 7 existed in =
many pieces=E2=80=94no agency existed to put them together, to =
=E2=80=9Cconnect the dots.=E2=80=9D Had a place of central analysis =
existed, the disaster would have been avoided. Nonsense.
Our Navy had broken the Japanese diplomatic code and, from a succession =
of Tokyo=E2=80=99s messages to its Washington embassy, had concluded =
that the attack would happen in the place and at the time when it did. =
The Navy warned the White House and the War Department in time. But the =
latter=E2=80=99s warning to Pearl Harbor was sent by routine, and sat in =
Admiral Kimmel=E2=80=99s mailbox as the attack took place.
The truth that analysis of Intelligence must include a multiplicity of =
sources, and that a central repository of information is needed for =
that, was always the strongest argument for the existence of some sort =
of central facility where =E2=80=9Call source analysis=E2=80=9D could be =
done. But, since at least the 1980s, computers have made it possible and =
imperative for all analysts, regardless of their location, to access =
everything securely. Nowadays, ironically, CIA=E2=80=99s insistence on =
managing the access and distribution of information is the biggest =
barrier to universal, all-source Intelligence analysis.
Today, CIA is good for confidential meetings with the New York Times, =
theWashington Post, NBC News, etc., through which it joins=E2=80=94if it =
does not lead=E2=80=94campaigns to shape domestic American opinion.
What is the FBI good for?
Once upon a time, FBI foreign counterintelligence officers were cops =
first. Like all good cops, they knew the difference between the people =
on whose behalf they worked, and those who threaten them. They had =
graduated from places like Fordham, a Catholic, blue-collar university =
in the Bronx. Like T.V.=E2=80=99s Sergeant Joe Friday, they wore white =
shirts and said yes, sir, yes, ma=E2=80=99am. Unlike CIA case officers, =
FBI officers mixed with the kinds of people they investigated, and often =
went undercover themselves. The FBI jailed Capone and dismantled the =
Mafia. Because it used to take counterintelligence seriously, it was =
able to neutralize Soviet subversion in the USA. The old joke was that, =
in any meeting of the U.S. Communist Party or of its front groups, a =
majority of attendees were FBI agents. The only U.S. Intelligence =
penetration of the Kremlin was the FBI=E2=80=99s recruitment of a U.S. =
labor activist whom high-level Soviets trusted.
In the late 1970s, that began to change. Director William Webster =
(1978-87) refused to back up the officers who had infiltrated and =
surveilled the New Left=E2=80=99s collaboration with the Soviets against =
America in the Vietnam War. Webster also introduced contemporary =
political correctness into the FBI. Asked by the Senate Intelligence =
Committee why his FBI had neither infiltrated nor disrupted the Jim =
Jones cult that resulted in the deaths of 900 Americans in Jonestown, =
Guyana, he answered that he would no more have interfered with that =
religion than with the Catholic Church. Not incidentally, the Jim Jones =
cult was associated with the Democratic party.
Thus FBI officers became standard bureaucrats who learned to operate on =
the assumption that all Americans were equally likely as not to be =
proper targets of investigation. They replaced the distinctions by which =
they had previously operated with the classic bureaucratic imperative: =
look out for yourselves by making sure to please the powerful.
Webster=E2=80=99s FBI joined the ACLU as the principal sponsor of the =
1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which judicially =
pre-cleared all electronic surveillance operations through ex parte =
secret proceedings, despite warnings that such pre-clearance amounts to =
warrants for warrantless surveillance, and hence that it incentivizes =
political abuse.
The directorships of William Sessions and Louis Freeh, ending in 2001, =
did nothing to slow the FBI=E2=80=99s evolution along these lines. =
Reliance on pseudo-scientific =E2=80=9Cprofiling=E2=80=9D vastly reduced =
the felt need for scruples.
Thus did the Bureau practically convict an innocent man, Richard Jewell, =
of having bombed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
=46rom the beginning, the FBI=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cprofiling=E2=80=9D =
process concluded that no foreign government or entity had been =
responsible for the dispatch of letters from a post office near where =
the 9/11 hijackers had lived containing weapons-grade anthrax. Rather, =
they claimed the attacks that killed five and injured 17 Americans had =
been the work of a lone, white, conservative scientist.
Thus it pursued and nearly broke one Steven Hatfill, whose lawsuit the =
government subsequently settled for $5.8 million. The FBI then turned =
its attention to someone else who fit its profile, Bruce Edward Ivins, =
whom it never charged but whom it ruined and hounded into suicide. After =
which it declared him guilty, but refused to make public the evidence on =
which it had reached its conclusion. Classified, you know? No one was =
ever charged with the crime. This matter defined Robert Mueller=E2=80=99s =
(2001-13) directorship.
The Bureau=E2=80=99s increasing adoption of military weapons and tactics =
further tempted its officials to shortcut intelligence for the sake of, =
well, war against disfavored persons and movements. In 1992 the Bureau =
conducted an 11-day war against the Randy Weaver family in a remote =
Idaho cabin, in which one law enforcement officer was killed along with =
the Weavers=E2=80=99 14-year-old son, and which ended with an FBI sniper =
killing Mrs. Weaver with baby in arms=E2=80=94and with an angry jury =
acquitting Weaver. A year later, the FBI ran another war against a =
religious cult in Texas that cost four lives.
And, oh yes, the FBI has protected America against such dangerous =
characters as Martha Stewart, Lewis Libby, and General Michael Flynn, by =
perfecting the technique of =E2=80=9Cperjury trapping=E2=80=9D (accusing =
someone of perjury by contrasting the target=E2=80=99s recollections =
with someone else=E2=80=99s) whoever is foolish enough to speak with its =
Special Agents.
Thus did the FBI become the politically weaponized, domestic danger it =
is today.
Political Dysfunction
The Intelligence agencies were the key element of the ruling class=E2=80=99=
s support of the Democratic Party in the 2016 election. Its senior =
officers, regarding themselves as guardians of their class=E2=80=99s =
right to rule, waged war on Trump=E2=80=99s candidacy.
There being no facts on which to base charges of Trump=E2=80=99s =
illegitimacy in office, the Agencies strove instead to create =
=E2=80=9Cpredicates=E2=80=9D for investigations, the very existence of =
which would substitute for facts and provide the bases for media =
accounts of Trump=E2=80=99s villainy. Since Trump was elected, the =
Agencies have been the indispensable element of the ruling class=E2=80=99s=
 =E2=80=9Cresistance.=E2=80=9D Through the media, they have defamed him =
using their hoary ploy: You must believe us because what we say is based =
on classified information. For that reason, your demand for =
corroboration threatens National Security.
CIA was first and foremost. Circa April 2016, it =E2=80=9Cvectored=E2=80=9D=
 some of its longstanding assets, including Stefan Halper in Britain and =
Joseph Mifsud in Italy, to approach low-level Trump advisers Carter Page =
and George Papadopoulos, respectively. Note: these agents were not =
seeking information. The meetings they initiated served as the factual =
bases for the outright lie that these advisers, and hence Trump, were =
involved in obtaining information from Russia to smear Hillary Clinton. =
This is the =E2=80=9Cnarrative=E2=80=9D that CIA conveyed to the media, =
whose renditions thereof would serve as a =E2=80=9Cpredicate=E2=80=9D =
(i.e. as a watered-down substitute for =E2=80=9Cprobable cause) to begin =
a formal investigation that would lead to more stories and lend further =
public force to the =E2=80=9Cnarrative=E2=80=9D: Trump as a Russian =
That narrative having taken root in the media by the summer of 2016, the =
Agencies initiated a formal counterintelligence investigation of the =
Trump campaign, along with a criminal investigation of him. This =
involved authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of the =
campaign and of him. But by this time, Intelligence surveillance of =
Trump had already been going on for months under Sec. 702 of the 1978 =
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Using this legal vehicle, Trump =
had been the real target though the surveillance was aimed nominally at =
the Russians. This is what Admiral Mike Rogers, head of the National =
Security Agency, told the president-elect on November 16, 2016, that =
caused him to move his transition headquarters to his NJ golf club.
It is essential to note that well before Trump was elected the extensive =
surveillance to which his campaign had been subjected had proved to U.S. =
Intelligence that neither he nor his had ever dealt with the Russians in =
any way about the election. None of the subsequent =E2=80=9Cinvestigations=
=E2=80=9D have unearthed anything that the Agencies did not already know =
months before November 2016. Nevertheless, these =E2=80=9Cinvestigations,=E2=
=80=9D based on the =E2=80=9Cnarrative=E2=80=9D that Trump had colluded, =
continued. They were not discovering facts. They were providing pretexts =
for accusations.
The supposition that the evidence exists in classified form remains the =
official excuse for the ruling class=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cresistance=E2=80=9D=
 to the Trump administration, and a feature of the Democrats=E2=80=99 =
impeachment of him. Obviously, such =E2=80=9Cinvestigations=E2=80=9D by =
=E2=80=9CIntelligence=E2=80=9D are about acting as the =E2=80=9Csword =
and shield=E2=80=9D of the ruling party and of the class it represents =
by spreading political lies.
The Intelligence agencies=E2=80=99 bureaucratic/corporate interests also =
contributed to their war on Trump.
Trump=E2=80=99s primary foreign policy adviser during the campaign, =
Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, had been director of the Defense =
Intelligence Agency. Like other directors of DIA, he had developed =
antipathy for CIA, and supported plans for removing it from its =
paramount role in the Intelligence Community. As Trump=E2=80=99s =
prospective National Security adviser, he would have implemented those =
ideas. Flynn was also privy to the details of the Obama =
administration=E2=80=99s clandestine activities in Libya that had led to =
the embarrassing destruction of the U.S. mission there with the loss of =
four American lives.
Whatever damage could be done to Trump=E2=80=99s election prospects or =
eventual legitimacy, =E2=80=9Cgetting=E2=80=9D Flynn was a priority unto =
itself. On November 10, 2016, in a highly unusual act of interference =
with a successor, and almost certainly at CIA Director John Brennan=E2=80=99=
s suggestion, Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn. On January 24, =
just after the inauguration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about a wholly =
legitimate conversation with the Russian ambassador and, with the =
transcripts of the intercepts thereof in hand, led him into =
recollections of that conversation inconsistent with the transcript=E2=80=94=
on the basis of which he was charged with lying to a federal =
investigator, ruined financially, and forced to plead guilty to save his =
son from indictment.
The intelligence agencies=E2=80=99 hostility, and the black eye of =
Flynn=E2=80=99 s indictment, impacted the first round of Trump=E2=80=99s =
personnel choices and forced him to look over his shoulder.
No sooner had Trump begun appointing officials than the CIA began to =
effectively veto his choices by denying them security clearances=E2=80=94i=
n the prototypical January 2017 case of NSC official Michael Townley, =
because he had been critical of the Agency. The FBI slow-walked =
investigations for security clearances.
No one disputes that any President has plenary authority to grant and =
remove clearances. But Trump chose to defer to the Agencies. Trump also =
deferred to the Agencies with regard to what documents are or are not =
legitimately classified, giving them free rein to =E2=80=9Cleak=E2=80=9D =
their versions thereof to the news media and to retreat behind security =
classification=E2=80=99s shield.
Presidential policies are only words, unless implemented by people =
committed to them. But as a result of this deference to his enemies, =
three years into the Trump administration only a fourth of presidential =
positions have been filled and Trump hops on one leg instead of running =
on four. At this rate, the Trump administration is sure to end without =
ever really having existed=E2=80=94which is the idea.
In sum, it is difficult to overstate the effect of the intelligence =
agencies=E2=80=99 participation in the =E2=80=9Cresistance.=E2=80=9D Why =
Trump has suffered their behavior is irrelevant.
FISA and Official Secrets
The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is not least among the =
incentives that have contributed to the U.S. Intelligence agencies=E2=80=99=
 professional and political dysfunction. One of the unintended =
consequences of secret judicial imprimaturs on investigations is that =
the FISA courts confer the status of official secrets on the results. At =
the same time, the U.S. government has been claiming that the Espionage =
Act demands that classified information be afforded something like the =
deference mandated by Britain=E2=80=99s Official Secrets Act. All this =
has empowered and emboldened bureaucrats.
By the late 1970s the intelligence bureaucracies=E2=80=94CIA, FBI, =
NSA=E2=80=94had become leery of conducting any electronic surveillance, =
even of Soviet Bloc embassies and persons, because some American =
leftists who had worked with said embassies against the U.S. in the =
Vietnam war had filed lawsuits against prominent individuals in these =
bureaucracies. Hence the agents clamored for judicial warrants to =
protect them from lawsuits in national security cases in the same way =
they are protected in cases of wiretaps for domestic criminal purposes.
Trouble was=E2=80=94and is=E2=80=94that to ask a judge for a warrant in =
any ordinary court is eventually to reveal the surveillance to the =
objects thereof. The bureaucracies asked Congress to square the circle =
by establishing a court to rule ex parte, secretly. But FISA, by =
providing judicial pre-authorization for many of our national security =
bureaucracies=E2=80=99 actions, is perverting the American legal system =
and fostering a secret body of common law hostile to civil liberties.
Prior to FISA, the intelligence bureaucracies=E2=80=99 actions, although =
unquestionable a priori because undertaken secretly, could always be =
questioned openly and thoroughly ex post facto. Once FISA became law =
however, the defense that any given act was good because it was lawful =
made substantive questioning far more difficult. It is also more =
difficult because the information=E2=80=99s classified status now enjoys =
judicial approval.
In 1978, the American Bar Association invited me to debate the issue =
with professor Antonin Scalia at the University of Chicago=E2=80=99s law =
school. I said that requiring judicial authorization for an executive =
action in pursuit of national security is an unconstitutional =
obstruction of the president=E2=80=99s power as commander-in-chief. =
Scalia agreed, but pointed out that the president, i.e., the =
bureaucracies, had agreed to support involving judges in national =
security because they realized that the obstruction is theoretical =
rather than practical: FISA=E2=80=99s secret court, having no basis for =
judging what is or is not required for national security, would merely =
give the Agencies the confidence to do their jobs. I countered that this =
very confidence would be problematic: although strictly speaking the =
court could confer only a procedural imprimatur, in practice that =
imprimatur would shield the bureaucracies=E2=80=94and the =
President=E2=80=94from having to defend the substantive value, and the =
propriety, of any act of surveillance.
I also pointed out that ex parte secrecy had been the defining feature =
of England=E2=80=99s infamous =E2=80=9CStar Chamber=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the =
very negation of Anglo-Saxon due process. Scalia agreed, but pointed out =
that the FISA court=E2=80=99s jurisdiction would be very limited. I =
countered that Congress could expand that foreign body, and that it =
would expand in practice. Scalia said that we were debating only the law =
then proposed, as indeed we were.
But the law=E2=80=99s logic asserted itself. Already in the 1980s the =
Intelligence Committees were receiving requests to place authorization =
for FBI infiltration of domestic groups =E2=80=9Cof national security =
interest=E2=80=9D within the FISA system. In 2001 Congress and the =
President enacted section 702, which effectively authorizes all manner =
of warrantless surveillance of Americans so long as it is excused as =
=E2=80=9Cincidental=E2=80=9D to collection on foreigners.
FISA became law because the Intelligence Agencies=E2=80=99 (primarily =
FBI=E2=80=99s) concerns dovetailed with those of the sincere =
ACLU-variety liberals of that time. The liberals then believed that =
involving the judiciary in decisions to wiretap foreigners, and drafting =
guidelines severely to limit the retention and use of data collected =
incidentally about =E2=80=9CU.S. persons,=E2=80=9D would gradually =
extend the Fourth Amendment=E2=80=99s standards of =E2=80=9Cprobable =
cause=E2=80=9D plus warrants to foreign Intelligence. At the time, I =
warned fellow Senate staffer John Elliff and other liberal drafters =
agonizing over the rules=E2=80=99 minutiae that their words were not =
housebreaking Intelligence, but rather giving bureaucrats the means of =
covering political surveillance with a cloak of pretend =
legality=E2=80=94providing them with temptations they eventually could =
not resist. They were legalizing Watergate.
Watergate, recall, was an attempt by two of President Nixon=E2=80=99s =
staffers to gather information about the opposition party=E2=80=99s 1972 =
presidential campaign. That anyone connected with the U.S. government =
should use government resources to disadvantage a political opponent was =
scandalous. Barriers to investigating it were judged just as scandalous, =
and all involved in Watergate were punished severely.
As noted above, U.S. government Intelligence began electronic =
surveillance of Trump as soon as it became possible that he would be the =
Republican nominee. In the spring of 2016 it also infiltrated his =
campaign with its agents and instituted =
investigations=E2=80=94counterintelligence and criminal=E2=80=94soon =
thereafter. This was Watergate on a massive scale.
By October, the surveillance and investigations had turned up nothing =
that substantiated the notorious =E2=80=9CSteele Dossier=E2=80=9D that =
the media had been touting since summer. Never mind the charges that =
Trump was beholden to Russia=E2=80=94they failed to turn up anything =
that would derail Trump upon release. Hence, when it began to seem =
possible that Trump might win, the bureaucrats who had ordered the =
surveillance and investigations faced the possibility of having to =
explain by what right they had done it.
FISA was available for legal cover. In a nutshell: they re-packaged the =
Steele Dossier on which the public charges had been based and presented =
it to the FISA court, nominally to get a warrant for surveillance of =
low-level Trump adviser Carter Page and the rest of the campaign. They =
did this in late October=E2=80=94far too close to the election to obtain =
any information useful in that regard. The Agencies having surveiled =
Trump for seven months, the warrant served neither the gathering of =
information nor any offensive purpose.
Instead, through the Carter Page warrant, the FBI got the Court to =
warrant, by political implication, the surveillance that had begun in =
April under Section 702, as well as the counterintelligence/criminal =
investigation (initiated formally on July 31, but actually begun in =
April). FBI officials were able to do this because at least some of the =
federal judges who staff the FISA Court had become part of the same =
political party.
In 1972 nobody had to ask whether or not the president=E2=80=99s men who =
burglarized the DNC suite at the Watergate Hotel were committing the =
(only in America) high political crime of using government power against =
the opposition candidate. The only question was =E2=80=9Cwhat did the =
president know, and when did he know it?=E2=80=9D Nor were there any =
legal obstacles to obtaining any documents or testimony regarding who =
had done what. Since a crime was involved, the courts struck down the =
president=E2=80=99s claim of executive privilege.
But in 2016, when the president=E2=80=99s men used the full power of the =
FBI and CIA to surveil and defeat the opposition candidate and then to =
de-legitimize the election=E2=80=99s winner, they were confident knowing =
they had acted with the FISA Court=E2=80=99s imprimatur, and that the =
bureaucratic machine=E2=80=94Inspectors General, etc.=E2=80=94would =
agree that that their request to the Court had been properly =
=E2=80=9Cpredicated.=E2=80=9D They turned out to be correct.
Since early 2017, as first a trickle and then a flood of evidence has =
become public that all four of the FISA court=E2=80=99s approvals of =
surveillance warrants were based essentially on political lies, no judge =
has hauled in any bureaucrat to face comeuppance for contempt of court. =
Nor have any judges complained of having been fooled. Only in 2020, =
after the Justice Department officially informed the FISA Court that at =
least two of the warrants it had issued were based on fraudulent =
presentations, did the Court acknowledge that these warrants had been =
issued invalidly.
Moreover, since the bureaucrats=E2=80=99 submissions to the Court were =
classified, the CIA, FBI, and Justice Department bureaucracies refused =
even Congress=E2=80=99s and the new president=E2=80=99s demands to see =
them, unredacted. Classified, you know?
But why give implicit respect to claims of classification?
Under the Espionage Act, Federal officers can classify the information =
they generate as =E2=80=9Cconfidential=E2=80=9D if, according to their =
judgment, its publication would =E2=80=9Charm=E2=80=9D the United =
States; as =E2=80=9Csecret=E2=80=9D if they think the harm would be =
=E2=80=9Cserious=E2=80=9D; and as =E2=80=9Ctop secret=E2=80=9D if they =
judges the prospective harm =E2=80=9Cespecially serious.=E2=80=9D =
Classification being merely the classifier=E2=80=99s opinion, =
publication or release of classified information is not a crime in =
America, unless it can be shown that it was harmful, and that the person =
either knew it would do harm or acted recklessly.
But now, because of ruling class solidarity and bureaucratic =
self-interest, a classified stamp increasingly endows documents with the =
status of Official Secrets, and the documents=E2=80=99 possessor with =
the authority to withhold them =E2=80=93 while briefing the press on his =
version of them with impunity.
In sum, FISA=E2=80=99s judicial involvement in national security affairs =
made Watergate-type operations into lawful tools of government power. =
But also, by the logic of power and class solidarity, it has contributed =
to making the protection of security into a system that allows the =
well-connected to make accusations anonymously while making it =
impossible for those accused to fully defend themselves on substance. =
FISA has helped make National Security secrecy the last refuge of =
Americans, ruling class included, share an interest in removing the =
Intelligence Agencies from domestic politics and refocusing them on =
their natural functions. Yes, they have served, and are serving now as =
the ruling class=E2=80=99s sword and shield. Yet this class=E2=80=99s =
members know that Praetorians=E2=80=99 natural tendency is to govern on =
their own account. Knowledge of Intelligence=E2=80=99s power to =
arbitrate intra-ruling class struggles is the reason why Stalin purged =
and killed KGB chief Nikolai Yezhov and Khrushchev did the same to =
Lavrentiy Beria, why Mao did it to Kang Sheng, and why Fidel Castro =
executed General Arnaldo Ochoa S=C3=A1nchez on trumped-up charges.
Without switching allegiances, the Sword and Shield=E2=80=99s handlers =
can ruin their patrons merely by taking sides in their internecine =
quarrels. In fact, the U.S. Agencies=E2=80=99 outsized impact on the =
2016 election and aftermath began when someone hacked into the DNC=E2=80=99=
s e-mails, the publication of which showcased that the Party hierarchy =
had taken Hillary Clinton=E2=80=99s side against insurgent Bernie =
Sanders. The FBI, by not pressing an investigation into who had done the =
hacking while espousing the baseless narrative that =E2=80=9Cthe =
Russians=E2=80=9D had done it to help Trump, helped avert intra-Democrat =
bloodletting while boosting Clinton. When the next internal clash comes, =
the Agencies could well decide the contest.
Here is a sketch of the major measures by which any president and =
Congress could help guard the Republic against the Agencies, in =
ascending order of importance and difficulty.
Repeal FISA
Were the executive branch to challenge FISA in court, it is difficult to =
imagine the argument by which to sustain the constitutionality of =
involving the Judiciary in national security surveillance.
Neither Professor Scalia nor anyone else made any such arguments in =
1978. At the time, civil libertarians accepted in good faith the =
immunities that FISA was giving the Agencies in exchange for their =
good-faith promise to take seriously the parchment barriers contained in =
the law. The Justice Department winked at this accord=E2=80=99s patent =
un-constitutionality because it removed objections to needed =
surveillance of foreigners while posing no immediate threats. Hence, =
FISA became known as =E2=80=9Can indispensable tool=E2=80=9D for =
national security=E2=80=94as if needed surveillance had never been done =
before FISA and could not take place without it. But as the years wore =
on, good faith succumbed to partisanship, and tolerating little =
violations of the Constitution for noble purposes had its usual effects.
Today, there is no more good faith.
Today, FISA=E2=80=99s existence (and expansion under Section 702) having =
facilitated gross U.S. governmental interference in our political =
process, there is broad consensus on the need for =E2=80=9Ca legislative =
fix.=E2=80=9D But because the problem lies in FISA=E2=80=99s very =
premise=E2=80=94the secret mingling of judicial and executive power=E2=80=94=
no such fix is possible. This being so, any legislative remedies=E2=80=94m=
ore elaborate standards and procedures, maybe even mandating a =
=E2=80=9Cdevil=E2=80=99s advocate=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94must be equally as =
vulnerable to partisan re-interpretation as the ones that John Elliff =
and friends elaborated in 1978. Parchment barriers notwithstanding, =
purpose-driven bureaucrats and friendly judges acting together in secret =
can do whatever they want.
With regard to Intelligence surveillance as with anything else, the =
Constitution makes it possible for the Judiciary to restrain the =
Executive by forcing each to work by their own rules. The Executive may =
work in secret. But the Judiciary may choose to examine that secret work =
in its own public sphere. The very possibility of a public hearing is =
greater incentive for the Executive to adhere to its own rules than =
submitting applications to an ex parte court in secret. Separation of =
powers=E2=80=94each branch concentrating on fulfilling its own =
responsibilities=E2=80=94is the U.S. Constitution=E2=80=99s genius.
Repealing FISA outright is as simple as the removal of a priori =
justification would be sobering. Minus FISA, the Agencies would find =
malfeasance more hazardous and more difficult to hide. Only Congress can =
repeal it. But the president can achieve the same effect by challenging =
FISA=E2=80=99s constitutionality in the Supreme Court, while ordering =
the Agencies not to submit any applications to the FISA Court. But =
changing the CIA=E2=80=99s and FBI=E2=80=99s habit of acting as partisan =
policymakers and, most recently, of throwing their weight around in =
domestic politics, will require reducing the Agencies=E2=80=99 size, =
resources, and pretenses.
The U.S. Intelligence community=E2=80=99s size=E2=80=94some $58 Billion =
annually for the National Intelligence Plan=E2=80=94ensures that those =
who administer it control a lot of careers, contracts, consultancies, =
and high-level contacts. That much money and power, added to the =
capacity to shield the basis of its pronouncements, comports prestige in =
spite of substantive incompetence.
Wasteful activity is the least of the problem. Much of what happens =
within Intelligence is counterproductive. Worse, the sense of power that =
comes from managing such big things=E2=80=94while having near-total =
control of how their own management is explained=E2=80=94accustoms its =
officials to a ruinous sense of entitlement to having their own way. As =
the Intelligence community has grown in size=E2=80=94nearly doubling =
since 9/11=E2=80=94it is becoming ever more a political force that =
pursues its own objectives.
Hence, shearing U.S. Intelligence=E2=80=94cutting down or out functions =
that are wasteful or dysfunctional=E2=80=94is an indispensable means to =
refocusing the Agencies on their proper functions. Shearing also creates =
opportunities for replacing the officials whom the bureaucracy had =
selected as its champions with ones chosen to do what they should while =
eschewing domestic politics. Nothing quite so focuses bureaucrats=E2=80=99=
 minds as the clear and present possibility of reductions in force.
This is truest regarding CIA, the Community=E2=80=99s most politicized =
part, which wields outsized influence in Washington and in the media. =
=46rom the beginning, the Agency took on a peculiar socio-political =
character and gathered its personnel=E2=80=99s allegiance to itself =
rather than to the president=E2=80=94or to the United States. Legally, =
shearing CIA is the easiest of tasks because, by the law that =
established it, its employees may be hired, managed, and fired strictly =
at the president=E2=80=99s pleasure.
The candidates for shearing include major technical Intelligence =
programs that have become known to their targets, and which hence have =
become potential avenues of disinformation. Many of CIA=E2=80=99s human =
Intelligence operations should also be considered for shearing because =
of their structural operational insecurity. Since lack of operational =
security and quality control is arguably U.S. Intelligence=E2=80=99s =
major shortcoming, lack of these features in any given programs should =
put it on the chopping block.
The gargantuan amounts of metadata of U.S. telephone calls and emails =
have been judged useless and worse: the infrastructure for storing them =
should be eliminated.
Much if not most of the Community=E2=80=99s vast network of consultants =
has always been a kind of echo chamber and welfare system for the =
well-connected, and should be eliminated.
CIA=E2=80=99s Directorate of Intelligence, vastly overstaffed and =
specializing in groupthink, tries to be the U.S. government=E2=80=99s =
official interpreter of foreign reality=E2=80=94a worse than useless =
function. The Community=E2=80=99s very size has occasioned the =
establishment of support structures, such as the National Intelligence =
University, to prepare persons for service in it. Surely, these should =
be abolished.
Not least of the benefits from the cuts would come from explaining to =
the public how they remedy wrongs and improve performance. Such =
explanations would also temper the resistance they would generate.
Since the reduction and possible elimination of programs impacts the =
interests of well-connected officials=E2=80=94and especially of =
corporate contractors=E2=80=94resistance and lobbying are sure to be =
fierce. But the personal, private motivation of these factional =
interests can serve as an argument for why the cuts are in the national =
interest. Each cut should be made in ways that de-mystify Intelligence, =
and put it in its natural place as the servant rather than the master of =
Getting It Right
The trope that knowledge of others=E2=80=99 secrets is prerequisite to =
understanding how we should deal with them is the reverse of the truth. =
In fact unless we know who we are and what=E2=80=99s good for us; unless =
ordinary intercourse has taught us what others are about; unless we use =
our intelligence in the ordinary sense of the word, secret Intelligence =
can only confuse us. And in fact, though the United States has never =
suffered because our officials lacked knowledge of others=E2=80=99 =
secrets, the American people have suffered much from their willful =
ignorance of the realities against which they continue to stub our toes.
All too often, they have used Intelligence to counter common sense. =
During the Cold War, arguments over secret tidbits about Soviet weapons =
allowed policymakers to sidestep the question before them: how shall we =
defend America? More recently, arguments about Iraq=E2=80=99s and =
Iran=E2=80=99s Weapons of Mass Destruction obscured the real question: =
what is our interest in the Middle East, and how shall we serve it?
Intelligence being policy=E2=80=99s natural servant, it cannot carry any =
policy=E2=80=99s burden. Intelligence can help intelligently conceived =
policy to succeed. But it cannot rescue congenitally dumb policy. Asked =
to address students at the National Intelligence University who were =
asking what they could do to help our troops in Afghanistan, I could =
only set their consciences at ease: No amount of Intelligence could help =
distinguish between friendly Youssef and unfriendly Ahmed, never mind =
turn the latter into the former.
At home as well, it turns out that lack of intelligence is more =
troublesome than lack of Intelligence. Almost all acts of terrorism are =
perpetrated by persons already well known to local law enforcement or to =
the FBI. The perpetrators are not =E2=80=9Clone wolves=E2=80=9D out of =
nowhere, but known wolves, known to Intelligence but not to =
intelligence. At home like abroad, our real need is for ordinary =
intelligence, along with ordinary virtues.
Hence, as we reshape U.S. Intelligence to better serve the Republic, we =
need not fear that we will deprive ourselves of knowledge for our own =
Function and Intelligence
Secrets help refine plans for action. They do not define action=E2=80=99s =
parameters. Their value depends on the difference they make to the =
plans=E2=80=99 success. That is why Intelligence is normally =
subordinated to operations. The U.S. Army, Navy, and Diplomatic service =
used to collect such secrets as they needed. Specific supply followed =
specific demand. But by establishing CIA as the central organ of U.S. =
intelligence, the 1947 National Security Act reversed this natural =
CIA was to be responsible for no operations except for such covert =
activities as the President might order.
The Act granted CIA a near monopoly on human collection and =
communication with the president and Congress on Intelligence matters. =
It subordinated the Intelligence activities of the government=E2=80=99s =
operating departments to CIA supervision. These departments now keep =
control of Intelligence in which CIA is uninterested and get most of the =
Intelligence they need from or through CIA. Hence, they get what the CIA =
system produces, given its own interests and capacities, regardless of =
their own needs. Because the Agency soon developed its own particular =
predilections, the gap between what the operators need and what CIA has =
available has always been wide. U.S. Intelligence became controlled by =
the producers of secret information=E2=80=94not by its consumers. The =
results have been comparable to those of other producer-dominated =
CIA was created specifically and primarily to serve the president of the =
United States. Informing him is its primary job. But, from the =
beginning, CIA officers crossed the line between informing the president =
and claiming the right to form his mind=E2=80=94as well as the rest of =
the government=E2=80=99s mind. Ever less subtly, CIA has claimed that it =
is improper, even illegitimate, for anyone in the U.S. government, =
including the president, to act or even to think about foreign affairs =
contrary to its own supremely authoritative judgments. Over the decades, =
the media have echoed CIA=E2=80=99s complaints whenever presidents have =
acted regardless of or against CIA=E2=80=99s recommendations.
This is doubly wrong. Yes the president, constitutionally responsible as =
he is for the conduct of the armed forces and foreign relations, must =
have an architectonic view of what he is up against. But that does not =
mean that his advisers can know the military=E2=80=99s and the diplomats =
needs for information. Much less does it authorize the standard CIA view =
that its job =E2=80=9Ccomprises all the major evaluative and predictive =
functions=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cleaves the policy-maker little or =
nothing in the decision-making process except the ceremonial finale.=E2=80=
=9D But this has been the basis for its attempts to substitute =
bureaucratic authority for that of officials responsible to voters. =
CIA=E2=80=99s complaints are another instance of our ruling class=E2=80=99=
s attempt to push aside representative government in favor of the =
Administrative State.
In sum, since 1947, U.S. Intelligence=E2=80=99s basic structure has =
separated the collection and analysis of secrets from the functions they =
should serve. Having created a presidential Agency with no functions to =
fulfill for which it may be held responsible has encouraged that =
Agency=E2=80=94and others by imitation=E2=80=94to presume presidential =
powers. A non-responsible agency became irresponsible. We should reverse =
the process.
Congress, being beholden to the Agencies=E2=80=99 contractors, enmeshed =
with their bureaucracy, and ignorant of their failings given their =
oversight Committees=E2=80=99 unserious oversight, (Devin Nunes=E2=80=99s =
2015-19 chairmanship on the House side and Malcolm Wallop=E2=80=99s =
1981-85 budget chairmanship on the Senate side excepted) will not amend =
the 1947 National Security Act until it learns that it should. The =
president can help it learn by exercising his substantial authority to =
subordinate Intelligence to the government functions it is supposed to =
serve. Exercising that authority requires more attention to Intelligence =
than presidents heretofore have wanted to devote. But, the Agencies =
having played such a prominent part in the Resistance against President =
Trump, neither he nor any future president can afford not to force them =
out of politics while focusing them on their jobs.
The President should end the CIA=E2=80=99s monopoly on providing =
Intelligence to himself and the NSC; demand to receive his Intelligence =
briefings from State, Defense, and Treasury as well; order CIA to stop =
characterizing the documents that it produces as authoritatively and =
exclusively of =E2=80=9Cnational=E2=80=9D status and encourage other =
agencies to create whatever documents and briefings might flow from =
their expertise. By doing so the president would broaden the =
perspectives to which the top levels of government are exposed, =
introduce open intellectual competition in the analysis of Intelligence, =
and remove Intelligence officers=E2=80=99 temptation to substitute their =
judgment for that of responsible officials. Top officials, and the =
president himself, having become habituated to receiving just one =
perspective, would feel the weight of additional responsibility.
This would also be a first step in the parceling out of CIA=E2=80=99s =
functions, and a demonstration of the benefits thereof.
The President should also end the CIA=E2=80=99s near monopoly on human =
Intelligence. The need for Intelligence from persons under covers other =
than the ones CIA provides is undeniable. CIA did not object to the =
creation of a corps of undercover agents in the Justice Department=E2=80=99=
s Drug Enforcement Agency because its own people would not even try to =
do that dirty, dangerous work. Heretofore, however, it has objected to =
the military running its own deep cover agents. The president should =
override those objections and direct OMB to budget funds for such human =
Intelligence as the Services think necessary for military operations. =
Broadening the Services=E2=80=99 collection would also enrich the =
DOD=E2=80=99s analytical products.
Most of the National Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance =
Office are properly run by the military for military needs. But =
substantial technical systems that are aimed at political Intelligence =
are planned and controlled by CIA. Since the =E2=80=9Ctake=E2=80=9D =
therefrom is useful primarily for foreign relations, the State =
Department is best fit to judge what it needs from them. The President =
should decide to reorganize accordingly.
The covert exercise of political and paramilitary influence was not =
least of the reasons for CIA=E2=80=99s establishment. But international =
law does not treat threats, blandishments, support, or opposition any =
differently if done with greater or lesser degrees of secrecy. In =
retrospect, influence on other countries being the proximate purpose of =
foreign relations, the benefits of maintaining the =E2=80=9Cplausible =
deniability=E2=80=9D (utter secrecy of actions being inherently =
impossible) of U.S. influence are difficult to understand.
Subsequent experience makes it more difficult to avoid the conclusion =
that covert action=E2=80=99s covertness was always meant to allow the =
U.S. government to avoid publicly confronting the question =E2=80=9Cwhat =
are we doing in the world on whose behalf?=E2=80=9D because it is the =
flip side of the core domestic question: =E2=80=9Cwho and what among us =
is right, and wrong?=E2=80=9D
CIA=E2=80=99s covert actions=E2=80=99 covertness within the U.S. =
government resulted in not sufficiently thinking through their =
consequences. Worse, covertness allowed the U.S. government to defer =
basic choices between foreign policy alternatives. Often, while the =
State Department pursued option A, the government would keep option B =
alive through CIA. Multi-track policy has also been instrumental in =
erasing the distinction between war and peace.
The president should decide to abolish the ruinous category =E2=80=9Ccover=
t action=E2=80=9D and hence make the State Department responsible for =
the exercise of all manner of political influence abroad, and the =
military services responsible for military and paramilitary affairs.
The President of the United States should control Intelligence by the =
very means by which he controls all other parts of the National Security =
establishment: The National Security Council. That is, assuming that he =
controls it, and not the other way around.=

The Threat of Privacy=20
By Charles M. Kahn1
Like artists, we academics want to believe that if one of our works doesn=E2=
=80=99t get enough attention it=E2=80=99s because we=E2=80=99re ahead of our=
 time. I=E2=80=99d like to pretend that everything I=E2=80=99ve written is p=
athbreaking, and will eventually be recognized for its true importance. But I=
 have to admit that there are really only a couple of cases where I can say w=
ith hindsight that something I wrote has been ahead of its time.
One of them2 is a paper written with Jamie McAndrews and Will Roberds, publi=
shed in 2005, and titled =E2=80=9CMoney is Privacy.=E2=80=9D We wrote it par=
tly as a response to Narayana Kocherlakota=E2=80=99s famous paper =E2=80=9CM=
oney is Memory,=E2=80=9D which could be taken as arguing that cash is essent=
ially a record=E2=80=90keeping device, tracking who was a net creditor and w=
ho a net debtor to society with respect to resources provided or consumed. T=
he implication was that if it became easy to keep credit records directly, c=
ash could wither away.
In our paper we argued instead that a key role of cash was its ability to pr=
otect the purchaser=E2=80=99s identity. So we predicted that, even while the=
 reductions in costs of record keeping and increases in the speed of data tr=
ansmission were expanding the usage of credit=E2=80=90 and deposit=E2=80=90a=
ccount=E2=80=90 based payments arrangements, cash would survive. Because the=
 desire for privacy would always generate demand for cash, it would be a mis=
take=E2=80=94and ultimately futile=E2=80=94to attempt to abolish it. At the t=
ime, people were attuned to many of the problems of privacy, but there had n=
ot yet been a clear recognized link between the value of privacy and the rol=
e of payments systems. (Remember, bitcoin was only released in 2009).

I suppose the following may read like a bunch of gobbledegook to most =
people, but I suppose I can=E2=80=99t really care. It makes sense to me =
at the moment. Though I need a nap, now.
A frequent trope of the cypherpunk list in the middle 1990=E2=80=99s was =
the character J. Random Cypherpunk.=20
The name is self-explanatory, but he had just as much cred there as a =
social/political variable as the cryptographic variables Alice, Bob, =
Carol, or Dave. Mrs. RAH and I had a cat named Alice and still have a =
dog named Dave. Heh. Never got around to using Randy before Mrs. RAH =
took away my nomenclature card, but we did get to Eve, Mallory, Rusty =
(Trusty, Trusted Entity, whatever, Trent was just too foppish, didn=E2=80=99=
t lend itself to a dog=E2=80=99s call name), all of whom are gone, now. =
Animals after them had sensible names, like Red, an aging black-mouthed =
bob-tailed red =E2=80=9Cheeler=E2=80=9D who likes to sleep on my right =
foot like he owns it, particularly around suppertime.
Somehow this afternoon I=E2=80=99m thinking about the universe, the =
simulation thereof, the multiverse, and anthropism, and out pops J. =
Random Universe.
It=E2=80=99s all about randomness. It=E2=80=99s now obvious to me that =
you can=E2=80=99t study infinity without randomness. Any first semester =
calculus student knows that. I must have smoked a number on the way to =
class that day. Epsilons and deltas were boring, and it turns out that =
they were just tacked onto calculus after the fact to keep it nailed =
down so it didn=E2=80=99t blow away.=20
Nonetheless, I argue this with the same lumpen-enthusiasm that I argue =
about the recent =E2=80=98discovery=E2=80=99 of mine that has been =
obvious to anyone else, like, say, my recent breathtaking intuition, =
after four of five decades of acquaintance with it, that Hegelianism is =
pure and simple moral relativism. In the same Hegelian vein, I suppose =
it=E2=80=99s safe to say that since history is the application of a =
human narrative to previous events, it is an art, and not a science to =
begin with. Another thing that everybody figured out long before I did, =
and completely agrees to Popper=E2=80=99s proof that Marxism is =
pseudoscience. You always know the end of a story before you can write =
it, or at least re-write it into actual coherence. Post hoc, etc.
I have a friend who=E2=80=99s a priest, more fun, a converted Mormon, =
who has said at least once in public that I=E2=80=99m going to end up a =
=E2=80=98towel-boy in purgatory=E2=80=99 because of my =
backslid-from-Unitarian-but-declared-anyway metaphysical naturalism. =
Since we=E2=80=99re talking about stuff that sends the average =
scientific, or at least mathematical, dogmatic atheist scurrying to the =
confessional, this should be entertaining.=20
Right. Cosmology. Sorry. This is going to be one of those things for =
which a preamble is not really necessary. I needed to pad things out a =
Everybody knows by now that a single universe cannot contain all the =
unlikelihood that life exists in this one, much less   intelligence, for =
various values thereof. Gelertner, Berlinsky, and Meyer are all over =
this like a duck on a junebug. Heard it on a Hoover podcast with Peter =
Robinson last year. They point and laugh at a multiverse, especially the =
idea that some anthropic principal dictates it. I don=E2=80=99t agree. =
Not the first time I don=E2=80=99t agree with geniuses, I guess. It =
seems to me that anthropism in a multiverse is quite handy. If, like =
calculus, it hasn=E2=80=99t found it=E2=80=99s epsilons and deltas just =
yet, relying on infinity as a =E2=80=98no matter where you go, there you =
are=E2=80=99 in answer to =E2=80=98why are we here=E2=80=99, is as good =
a hack as any.
Which brings me to the idea of a universal simulation. Without following =
the turtles *all* the way down, I=E2=80=99d like to propose a =
cypherpunk=E2=80=99s solution.=20
The universe is discovered, not calculated. God does, it seems, play =
dice, to the extent that a literary character, um, plays. Not only is =
the universe unknowable by sheer dint of processing power, any arbitrary =
community of humans, much less a single one, cannot process enough =
information to calculate the entire universe in the Newtonian sense, or =
the Misian sense, for that matter.  Nor can any machine or arbitrary =
community of machines do that. =E2=80=98Community=E2=80=99 is fraught =
here, machine-wise, because it implies all kinds of things like emotion, =
the simulation of same, dominance hierarchies of emoting beings versus =
geodesics of processors, and all kinds of off the wall whoop-de-do, =
*gasping for air...* but also, the universe, at the quantum level is =
*random*. Incalculable, all the way up, all the way down. You can=E2=80=99=
t fool me Lord Russell.
If you were to simulate this universe, you would need to simulate =
randomness. At this point cypherpunks are waving their arms, semaphore, =
at the back of the room, while real cryptographers smirk in the front =
row. Pseudorandomness requires a seed. A key. And if you have a key, you =
can now *predict* the results of the simulation without having to run it =
to begin with.=20
Obviously this is wrong, full of amphiboly. But I=E2=80=99m too lazy to =
think about it now because it=E2=80=99s time for a nap.
