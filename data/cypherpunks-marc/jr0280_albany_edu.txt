I live in this area too and this is far different than the one I heard.  The description of events that I heard was that he was bothering *no one*, simply walking around wearing a shirt.  The mall did make that claim but I haven't heard anyone else say he was bothering anyone.  The newspaper story said they mall had one complaint about him, not "many." Also, the subsequent patrons wearing "Give peace a chance" where booted too and they were definitely not bothering anyone.  Only when public pressure came to bear did they relent.
Let's see, you believe you're engaging in protected speech, rent-a-cops come and tell you to stop, and you don't believe you have to. If you're going to lie down if you believe you have a valid argument then that's really weak.
I happen to agree with those who said that since he was on private property the property owners had every right to boot him off. I just think you should do a little more fact-checking before you post.
