It seems that they're at least starting on it:

Ah, that's good to know!  I'm just behind the times there.
Of course all that aside, there are lots of little packages in Debian
where the upstream tried to be clever.  Fixing the whole system could be
quite the chore.

This is what Ubuntu does, and I was under the impression that they
learned it from their Debian experiences with the same process.
Also I'm not entirely sure what you meant by "a CA-like model" but if
you're only talking about identity verification, you're missing a few
things.  Most important is keeping the real secrets in a master key that
can authorise or revoke functional signing keys as needed.  There are
other steps that the security experts all worked out when they first
realised that crypto wasn't magic and needed human processes to keep it
relevant.  It's all In The Literature.
I'm not sure how you audit something that's meant to happen in a sealed
bunker with a select few trusted shardholders.

Complacency about .pyc files is one of those things that has me kind of
looking through a gap in my fingers at some security situations.  I
mean, that's kind of like saying you ignore all ELF binaries, in some

Seth David Schoen:
I'd like to point out that Ubuntu forbids binary uploads, and maintains
a pool of build machines to ensure that mass-rebuilds of all packages
are possible (such as when the build toolchain is updated).  I think when Greg and I both read the word "deterministic", we imagined
some kind of system whereby given the same source tarball and build
toolchain and architecture, he and I could get binaries with identical
sha256sums on our two completely unconnected computers.  Such a system is a very good idea for verifying binaries, but build
systems are messy and like to do things like embed build timestamps and
build hosts in them (Linux kernel I am looking in your direction...)
