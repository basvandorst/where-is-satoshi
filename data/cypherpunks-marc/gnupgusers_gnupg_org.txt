Depending on what you mean by "fully compatible". The single biggest issue is
importing keys that don't have identity info on them. I submitted a patch to
GnuPG to fix this issue, but for some reason that is beyond me there seems to be
resistance to merging it:  - V

Can someone please explain to me why the GnuPG flag for key servers --no-modify
is in GnuPG and why the authors of key server software did not implemented this

This is undoubtedly a naive question. But anyway, would it be feasible
to test keys by importing them, and seeing which ones break OpenPGP?
Maybe do it in minimal Docker containers? And then somehow block access
to those keys?
Or is blocking just as impossible as deleting?
I know that wouldn't help people whose keys had been poisoned. But at
least it would help protect complex systems that rely on OpenPGP.
And if resource requirements would be impossible, what about focusing on
the most important keys? For key packages, say.

It sounds like SKS is dead meat. And hagrid is coming. And you advise:
So OK, I can purge requests to SKS keyservers from my machines. But what
about upstream impacts? As I understand it, GnuPG authentication is
pervasive. And I suspect that getting missing keys from SKS is common.
As an error trap, if nothing else.
How bad could this get?

No problen, we now have super modern GDPR compliant hagrid, WKD, keybase
and good old pgp.com key server. :-)
New version of Enigmail will default to hagrid. :-)

Huh, that's interesting. I was not aware of this issue, and wish you had reached
out to me, or to support or filed an issue on Hagrid.
This BSI requirement was not known to me. While it would be preferable to stick
with AEAD ciphersuites, I would of course add another ciphersuite if you say you
consider this a worthwhile tradeoff.
It would be good to sort out the policy issue at some point as well, but
I understand that won't happen overnight.

Thanks. That's almost right. But I'm not focusing on incentives. I'm
focusing only on impacts. Because as I understand it, you can't stop
people from poisoning certificates on the SKS keyservers.
I didn't forget about that. I just don't think that it matters. Unless
I've misunderstood the situation, the SKS keyservers are dead meat. And
have been dead meat for a decade.
So the focus has gotta be on a secure and capable replacement. And
meanwhile, on mitigating damage done through the SKS keyservers.
