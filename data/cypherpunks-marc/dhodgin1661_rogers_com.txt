@_subject: Re: What email encryption is actually in use? 
If you signed your messages on a regular basis, it would let me know whether or not you're the same Tim May, I've been reading since back
when toad.com was the only server for the list.
If you're key was signed by anyone I've dealt with, who I know will actually check your id, it would increase my confidence that you
really are Tim May, and not just a net persona.
It doen't make one iota of difference, whether you choose to distribute your key or not.  Your ideas are usually thought
and consistent enough to form a persona in the minds of the list
readers. Or at least, in mine.
I know you know (whether or not you agree) with the above.  It just
struck me as humourous that you'd sign the post, with the comment to the effect that there isn't much point in doing so, with a key
that isn't on the servers.
Do you see the PGP web of trust as completly useless?
As to who I am, well...
I'm a programmer, living in London, Ont. Canada.
I've been lurking, off and on, since 94 or so.  I don't think I've
actually posted anything to the list since back in 96, when I wrote a freeware program to simplify using PGP with dos based
offline mail readers (MPI.ZIP).
While I normally promote privacy issues, only with those I meet
face to face, I still consider myself a cypherpunk.  I normally
only post to the list, when my point of view isn't being expressed by any of the regular posters.
Regards, Dave Hodgins.
