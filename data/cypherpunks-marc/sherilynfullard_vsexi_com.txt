A police officer pulls over this guy who's been weaving in and out of the
lanes. He goes up to the guy's window and says, "Sir, I need you to blow
into this breathalyzer tube." The man says, "Sorry, officer, I can't do
that. I am an asthmatic. If I do that, I'll have a really bad asthma
attack." "Okay, fine. I need you to come down to the station to give a blood
sample." "I can't do that either. I am a hemophiliac. If I do that, I'll
bleed to death." "Well, then, we need a urine sample." "I'm sorry, officer,
I can't do that either. I am also a diabetic. If I do that, I'll get really
low blood sugar." "All right, then I need you to come out here and walk this
white line." "I can't do that, officer." "Why not?" "Because I'm drunk."
Billy and Bobby were small boys. They were brothers, and they often had
fights with each other.Last Saturday their mother said to them, "I'm going
to cook our lunch now. Go out and play in the garden - and be good.""Yes,
Mummy," the two boys answered, and they went out.They played in the garden
for half an hour, and then Billy ran into the kitchen, "Mummy, " he said,
"Bobby's broken a window in Mrs. Allen's house." Mrs. Allen was one of their
neighbors."He's a bad boy," his mother said. "How did he break it?""I threw
a stone at him," Billy answered,"and he quickly moved down.".
