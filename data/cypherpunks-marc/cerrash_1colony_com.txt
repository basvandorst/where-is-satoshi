A man enters a restaurant, takes a seat, and, instead of using the napkin,
takes the table cloth from the table and tucks it around his neck.The head
waiter sees it and tells the waiter to go and tell him, in a diplomatic way,
that what he did was incorrect. The waiter goes to the man and says, "Good
day to you Sir.. Would you like a shave or a haircut?".
Two men, John and Jim, traveling through the country in America, stopped at
a small inn for dinner. On the table there was a large cup of mustard.
Thinking the contents were custard or a sweet of some kind, Jim took a
spoonful of it and put it in his mouth. Tears ran down his cheeks, but
wishing to have his friend John caught in the same trap, he said nothing of
the mistake he had made. The other man, seeing that his friend was crying,
said: "Listen, Jim, what are crying about?" "I was thinking of my father who
was hanged twenty years ago," Jim replied. Soon after, John took a spoonful
of the mustard, and as the tears started down his cheeks, Jim in his turn
said "What are you crying about?" "To think you were not hanged the same day
your father was." came the answer.
