@_subject: Re:  Did you *really* zeroize that key? 
My experience is that in practice the opposite is true. Nonconformant
source code usually contains constructs that will give unexpected results
when optimized using newer ideas in the C language (such as aliasing),
so the compiler will in general be much more conservative when doing
optimizations on such code.
Consider for example the code (we assume sizeof(int) == sizeof(long))
   {
      int a = 23;
      long *p;
      p = &a
      *p += 5;
      if (a > 23)
      {
          foo();
      }
   }
If we opimized this as if it was confomant code, then we would determine
that p cannot alias with a (since they has different type), so the if-
statement will always evaluate to "false", and may thus be removed, i.e.
the code snippet collapses to
   {
      int a = 23;
      long *p;
      ptr = &a
      *p += 5;
   }
This kind of optimization is a really big win in some kinds of real world
programs, but cannot be done on nonconformant code.
Btw. one of the more important reasons that gcc does never optimize away
volatile is that every time this optimization is mentioned, there is
always a lot of flamage from embedded programmers that fear what will
happen when their timing loops
   volatile int i;
   for (i=0; i < 100000; i++)
      ;
gets optimized...

One thing that I have seen confuse people writing about the
new passports is that RFID may mean different technologies.  So
I'd like to mention that the passports will not use the simple
bar-code kind of RFID tags -- they will use chip cards
communicating over ISO/IEC 14443.
The current technology has big problems with working at a distance
(in fact, the tests done with COTS 14443 readers shows that most
have problems with reading passport-like cards even when placed at
the optimal distance...), but I don't know enough about antenna
technology to be able to guess what can be done by a dedicated

PS.  Most of the MRTD (Machine Readable Travel Documents) specifications
are available at PPS. Most people on this list seems to be interested in the US
passport, so you may be interested in that the US department of
state, and department of homeland security, seems to be doing a
pilot of the new passport.  The RFP is available from:
