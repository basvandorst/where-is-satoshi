Boring answer, but it's probably a badly configured load balancer.

I can't think of a more futile task. Watch out for JY's "outing" of any
such person as a TLA stooge in the next few months.

Crafty. That's just doomed the next 6 months of posts on this list to
trying to work out who's on whose side.
Thanks for attempting to encourage the occasional ray of rational
discussion over the last few years.

It's one person's plonk list. Why insist that it agree with you?

As far as I've seen, Cari doesn't spread posts to crypto-specific mailing
This is a decent list of people to plonk if you're a cryptography
researcher trying to keep up with the state of the art without being
bombarded by tangential political in-fighting and vanity posts. If you do
want to opt into the latter, you'd join cpunks.

The Daily Mail is definitely a tabloid (and The Mirror). I guess that

Also cyberpunk. Imagine a dystopic future of lonely, once angry, now tired
individuals who lash out at any suggestion they are wrong. Back in the 90s
they might have been nudged to tinker with crypto and empowering the world,
but instead they spent their time seeing how many times they could fit
"fuck" and "retard" into an email post.

I don't think you have a clue what libertarian means.
I see you're authoritarian about language too. Philosophy's history, much
like Scientology's, owes more to narcissism than etymology.
