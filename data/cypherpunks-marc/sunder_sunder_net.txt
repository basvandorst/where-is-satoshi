Feds complain Bin Laden not using hi-tech equipment
By Kieren McCarthy
Posted: 20/09/2001 at 16:57 GMT
Osama Bin Laden is evading detection by not using modern telecoms
equipment, the US intelligence services have told the press. "He switched
off a lot of communications technologies," a US intelligence spokesman
said. "Now it is other people talking for him. In an innocuous
conversation, you can't pick that out." Osama is so cunning, we are told, that he is now using human messengers
and family members to deliver instructions. "This isn't low-tech," a
former NSA consultant has been quoted as saying. "You'd have to really
call it no-tech."
... snip ...
Only last week, we were being told that increased surveillance - taps on
all ISPs and a backdoor in encryption systems - was the only way to stop
people like this. Now, seven days later, when hundreds of special forces
personnel are crawling around Afghanistan looking for the man, we're told
that all this technology and the billions spent on it are obsolete because
he's turned his phone off. That we are blind as a mole.

There is certainly no limit to the stupidity of those who would try to

can tell us what we should think.  I believe it is our responsability to
point this out publically, and let others take notice that we are subtly
manipulated by those with an agenda.
If you are indeed the same anonymous troll (note: not that I believe
anonymous remailers are bad!) who yesterday posted that cryptography was
bad, that cypherpunks are responsible in any way shape or form with this
terrorist act, that the DMCA and the like are good, my answer to you is
still: Go fuck yourself.
The terrorists have several agendas certainly.  One of which is causing
fear uncertainty and doubt.  Sadly, there are reports that this is
somewhat sucessful.  I personally, do not and will not feel fear,
uncertainty or doubt.  I will not allow this event to cloud or otherwise
alter the way in which I live.  The only change in me, and again, I do not
claim to speak for others, is that I feel rage towards them.
I do not believe that any heightened security measures at airports or
anywhere else will prevent this sort of thing from happening
again.  Previously, they had used guns, now they used knives, to
hijack airplanes.  Previously they have used car bombs.  I do not believe
they will continue to do the same because of the clampdowns.
But it is silly to think that anything short of hunting these bastards
down would stop them.  Curtailing any of our freedoms is inherently a bad
side effect, and mark my words, will not prevent further attacks.
One good thing that comes out of this is the deployment of sky marshals as
they are being called.  Finally someone somewhere has sense enough to
realize that "Gun" is not a four letter word and is necessary.
But what happens when they manage to switch places with a sky marshal and
thus have a vector of infiltration?  Shouldn't the pilots, crew and yes,
even passengers have guns?  Again, I operate with the full and confident
knowlege that 90+% of the population is good and law abiding.  That
allowing the public to be its own defender is by far more effective than
disarming them.
The one proven effective way to deal with them was displayed by the heros
who rushed the cabin and forced the fourth plane down in Pittsburgh.  We
as a society have become too complacent, too much the sheeple.  We must
re-learn what the founders of this country knew.  That liberty must be
defended and fought for.  With our lives.  We must not restrict our
freedoms, we must rather fight back with everything we've got.
The terroristas' agenda may be one of revenge, FUD, economic collapse, and
wishes to cause the public to force the government to change our policies
towards Israel and interfearing in their countries.
They do not wish us to tighten security, for that would work against them,
but in a very real sense, if we do, we allow their acts to curtail our
freedoms, and that is the only thing that separates our country's form of
government from the Taliban run Afghanistan.  Yes, we have more land, more resources, a better economy than they do.  But our freedoms are key to this success as Soviet run Russia has shown.  Freedom is what has made us prosperous, and if we curtail it, we march
towards the evil that is totalitarianism regardless of which face it wears
(monarchist, religeous, fascist, socialist, or communist.)
Sure, it was a stupid idea for the USA to help create the state of Israel
by taking land from Arabs that already hate Israelites and by placing it
square in the center of said Arabs, of placing the lamb so it is
surrounded by wolves.  Sure it was stupid of the USA to train and arm
these bastards* when they were called "Freedom fighters."
But the stupidest thing we have done is to allow them to live and grow.  Never let an enemy stand is the golden rule, and perhaps now we have
learned it.  When someone declares war on the USA, even if they're just a
bunch of guys that live in tents and fuck camels for fun, they have shown
that they are willing to cause us harm, and therefore must be exterminated
- just as we would the government of a country that has declared war on
us.  Not by attacking their civilians, but by chopping down the heads of
these groups.
And further, I hope that the $24B dollars that the Fed's have given us in
NYC will be used to rebuild a new World Trade Center with three such
towers.  They must see that if they knock down two towers, we will build
three or four or even five bigger ones.  Such a rebuilding effort would
help our economy by itself. They must learn that they will not be able to
weaken us, but rather strengthen us.
These events were very low tech, very well planned, very inexpensive.  It
would not take a great deal of resources, it would not take anonymous
remailers, cryptography, steganography, missles, tanks, bombs, or anything
of the like to pull off.  It proved that it didn't even take guns.  It proved that the sheeple among us who have been crying out against guns,
who have kicked our children out of schools for drawing pictures of their
grandfathers in uniform fighting in WWI, Korea, Vietnam or WWII, who have
berated and vilified cryptography, privacy, and liberty were mindless
stupid sheep **.
It proves that had we been allowed to carry guns openely and honestly,
even in airplanes, that the bastard* terroristas would not have been able
to pull this off.  It proves that attacks on our freedoms are inherently
wrong, and that they make us vulnerable against those who wish to harm us.

terrorists from simply weilding sharpened pencils?  A man with a gun,
that's what!  And what would stop a man with a gun from attacking mere
unarmed citizens?  Armed citizens, that's what!
And what's to stop hacker terrorists from breaking into our banks?  Strong
well designed cryptographic protocols, that's what!
Making laws against these technologies will do what?  Weaken us and make
us defenseless against these terror mongers, that's what!

@_subject: Re: Re: Why Plan-9? 
This could be bad.  Say B doesn't want to allow access to C for its file
systems. Then what?  Any mechanisms to prevent A from resharing it?  It's
also bad depending on how it's implemented.
Say A has a low bandwith connection to B such as ISDN, but it has a high
bandwith connection to C.  If C uses A to get to B, that slows you
down.  Does it treat the file systems differently or is it just resharing
a mounted file system?
Yeah, so now you're eating double the bandwith of hangar 18.  Say hangar
18 is connected over a T1 and nothing else.  You mount it's file systems
over nfs or whatever Plan 9 uses and do cd /ftp2.sourceforge.net, then you
copy a file from there.  Well now, you've just effectively doubled the traffic to hangar18.  If the
owner is paying a flat rate, it's not so bad, you're just wastng bandwith.  But if it's at a colocation it will be enough to go over the percentile
rating and have to pay for extra usage.
Even if the two boxes are on the same local network (broadcast domain),
you'd still saturate your hubs/switches by doubling this traffic, and even
slow down access (latency) as you're using plan-9 to translate from ftp to
it's native scheme to nfs.  Further, you're eating lots of extra cpu
cycles on the plan 9 box(es) while they do this. What if hangar18 has a few ftp sites mounted and you run the equivalent of
the find command (which recursively searches for files.)  It goes over the
ftp connections and walks every single connection of the internet?  That's
kind of insane.  It'll take forever and eat up bandwidth at both ends.
And as you say below, it would even cache some of it... ugh...  hope there
are limits to this.
Yeah, it's "cool" but wasteful.
Just DES? And no disk encryption????  What about swap?
Any ip filtering / firewalling mechanisms?  Any routing mechanisms?  Any
NATting mechanisms?
The clustering / distributing computing aspects of it are
cool.  But... I'm still not convinced...
So it's like kerberos in some ways?
Xwindows by itself without a window/desktop manager? yes that would suck
balls.  XWindows with Ximian GNOME or KDE, nope - it rocks, though not on
old hardware.
Whoop. :)  You can control most internet appliances through a web gui or
telnet/ssh command line anyway.

@_subject: Further thoughts on Reputation Capital systems and 
There are plenty of systems of reputation capital already in existance out
there. (RepCap to shorten it.)  In this post, I will use several fictional
examples, though the names may or may not resemble actual Nyms, within the
context of this post, they are fictional and any such resemblance is
purely coincidental (or halucinational in your case), and "you" refers to
another Nym, not necessarily the reader, as "I" does not refer to the
author, but yet another Nym.  Ditto for actual named Nym's.
In the finance world funds always have disclaimers stating that past
performance is not a predictor of future growth, but in practice past
performance is always used or at least taken into consideration.
Reputations are built based on interactions of individuals with others who
communicate references about their experiences.
For the longest time your credit record has sufficed.  Previous to that,
your riches or your actions, (or breeding - a poor solution) or the esteem
that others have for you that the viewer is acquainted with show (or at
least hint) your reputation to those who are unfamiliar with you.
New examples include things such as slashdot's karma points for insightful
postings, and ebay's feedback profiles that allow a buyer to rate a seller
numerically once per transaction with positive, neutral, or negative, and
a comment.  The seller can also rate the buyer and warn other sellers that
this guy pays on time or was a hassle, or a dead beat.
Anyone can view a nym's repcap and see all the comments along with the
items that were sold, etc.
Sellers can prevent those with negative or low rep-caps from posting bids,
or can state that those with less than a certain amount must pay by
certified check or credit card since they aren't trusted - or that their
personal checks must first clear, etc.
I actually like this model, but it can be expanded.  Reputation capital
can however be abused.
In a Cypherpunk reputation capital environment, Mallet can set up two nyms
and use them to defraud others.  Here I will present a way around this.
Mallet creates Alice and Bob, and has them perform some transaction over
and over again, on each transaction posting postive repcap to each other.
As Adam Shostack and Wei Dai's comments have pointed out, there are
possible abuses to such a system:
For the ebay model: Alice can sell Bob a used piece of toilet paper for
$0.01, and on completion both Alice and Bob post positive repcap's for
each other.  Of course both Alice and Bob are Mallet's Nym's, so Mallet
runs this process repeatedly until both Alice and Bob have high
repcap's.  This attack can be extended by Mallet over several hundreds of
Nym's to make this less obvious, and can be randomized somewhat, etc...
If a high rep-cap Nym is sold, the old owner can reursup the Nym if the
buyer doesn't revoke the old public key and issue a new one.  The old
owner can even have a predated revocation certificate causing
confusion.  But in this case, fraud has been commited, so the buyer must
have some recourse.
Perhaps the buyer can then disclose their identity (or rather their
original nym) and the signed messages between themselves and the
fraud.  Money may be perhaps reclaimed, or not depending on how the Nym
was sold.
RepCap's should certainly not just have a single dimension stating
positive or negative, but rather a set of vectors.  Certainly repcap
metadata about a sale is different than that of an essay posting, or that
of a social interaction.  (Choate might for example have the best bbq's in
the entire country and he might have huge successful parties, but perhaps
his posts leave something to desire.)
Perhaps XyzzY is a genius when it comes to her knowledge of perl scripts,
but she's notoriously in debt, so I might not want to accept business from
her, though when I read the perl mailing lists, I would happily see her
In a posting model such as Cypherpunks I believe I have an idea for a
decent system.  I'm not suggesting we implement this as there would be too
much resistance to a fully working restrictive repcap based mailing list
here, but, rather this can serve as a theoretical example.
We swipe a bit of the Slashdot system, a bit of the ebay system, and add
digital signatures.  Let's start with a post.
Say Tim posts a very brillian post about something.  The readers of the
post can if they chose to sign a hash of that message along with their
vote for postive, neutral, or negative and a small comment (not a reply to
the message, but a comment about the character of the post.)
This message does not make its way onto the list as a message, but rather
as metadata.  That is your special mail client won't display them to you,
so you won't see a flood of metadata emails, but your client will process
them after authenticating their signatures.  RepCap archive servers will
collect and cache these for anyone to see.  Individual clients can do the
same.  (You don't want a central server or a set of central servers as
these can be destroyed, etc. and then the system fails.)
Suppose that in my client, I hold Declan and Sandy in high reputation.  That is my cache of their repcap is high and positive in relation to
others.  Now suppose that Tim posts a message and suppose they both vote
that Tim's post was brilliant - thus give it a positive vote.  Instead of
adding just "2" points to my cache of Tim's rep, since I trust Sandy and
Declan as non-nutcases, their votes are weighed against their own repcap's
in my cache.
Say Tim has a repcap of 600, say Declan has 500, and Sandy has 400.  Then
I add +1 * 500/X from Declan's repcap and +1 *400/X to Tim's repcap, so
now my cache of Tim's repcap might jump to 620.
Now this is not Tim's true reputation capital which came from individual
votes, and can be downloaded from any archive by any new user at any time,
it's rather my view of it. For example, say Jim doesn't like Tim, Jim can change the weight of Tim's
repcap, or even the actual repcap in his own cache to something low, and
then Declan and Sandy's vote won't make any difference.
Further, if I or anyone else choses to, we can ignore posts by those with
repcap under a certain threshhold.  Doing so would also stop spammers from
getting their message displayed (but not necessarily the bandwidth
Any time I chose to, I can change my own cache of someone's repcap, thus
overriding public opinion.  Perhaps this personal setting for each Nym I
see would be locked either for a specific duration (so further votes can
change it later on -- see below example of Aimee and Faustine), or
forever.  These should only override the tallied up ones from the servers,
not replace them.  Perhaps I can also share my views of a certain Nym, stating that "Vulis is
a nutcase" or "Eric Hugh's is cool" and some sets of values, if I chose
to.  These can be the same as the weights I privately use to filter out
things, or they can be a different set - should I chose to be two faced.
But what about a new user who doesn't know Tim from Jim?  Simple.  They
can talk to the archive servers and get either a count of positives and
negatives or download the last six months worth of votes and optionally
comments, or even download all that the archives have for a particular
nym, including their public key, and any signatures on that key (pgp web
of trust, etc.)
Alternatively (or additionaly) the new user might want a query of what
Declan and Sandy think of this guy and perhaps average them to build the
How does a new Nym build repcap?  Lurkers who only read will be invisible,
so they won't have a reputation.  As soon as they post others can vote one
way or another, and based on the weight of the repcap of the voter, a
quick rep cap can be built.  As each person can decide to change their own
weights for that new Nym, this can be settled quickly.
For example both Faustine and Aimee had initially interesting posts, but
over time cracks appeared, lowering their repcap, etc...  Their repcaps
would have initially jumped up and then dropped.
Of course those that choose to opt out, should be able to do so by simply
not opting in the first place, though they might find it hard to do
business with those that do...
Note that everyone should be able to read all postings, and repcap
metamessages at any time without participating.
Flaws of course are that trust is not transitive (however, a system of
personal weights can ameliorate this), and that past behavior is not a
guarantee of future behavior (Nym's can go insane, or be cured of
insanity, can relapse, can sell/buy Nyms.)
Any other flaws?
Again, this is a ficticious example of a reasonable system.  It will
likely never work here on this mailing list, though another mailing list
like system can be created, though it would require both clients and
reputation servers.  The examples of people I used are entirely ficticious
any resemblance to real humans is coincidental, parental discretion
advised.  This message will burp itself in ten seconds, though you will
have to change its diapers all by yourself.

Sure, doing something is better than doing nothing, and it all boils down
to your threat model, as usual.  However, with the heightened 911 crap, it
seems these guys will do nearly anything to get the bad guy -- I wouldn't
put it past them to beat the shit out some one who just so happens to be
of arab descent until they sign a confession.
But one has to consider several factors in building a threat model
including: Why do I want to encrypt my hard drive?  Why do I want to
encrypt my emails?  How much attention am I attracting by starting to use
PGP now versus pre 911?  Can I communicate securely by means other than
Of course the cypherpunk answer is you should always encrypt everything
all the time, but if you haven't do so up until this point, is it worth
getting probed by the Feds?  Maybe it is if they have nothing on
you or you expect them to have little reason for fucking with you.
If you're of arabian descent, using PGP might just buy you a ticket to one
of those fancy new fangled jails where they don't let you have reasonable
access to a lawyer, a sweater, or much else among the company of the other
1100 or so suspected terror mongers.
On the other hand, if you're a known cypherpunk and have used PGP in the
past, this won't attract too much extra attention.
From what I've read in various articles the terror mongers didn't use the
internet for much, just had face to face meetings, etc.  So of course the
use of spyware bugs and carnivore is simply an opportunistic grab at
power.  But so were the Jim Bell and Toto arrests.
The question isn't what have you or I or Joe Sixpack to hide as much as
what do the Feds think you have to hide, and is it worth it to attract
their attention.  If you're willing to attract their attention, do you
have the technical means to thawart and detect their intrusion, do you
have the legal (and by implication money to buy legal) means, etc.
The technical stuff is fairly easy if you think it through, but
difficult/expensive to implement well.  Find all the holes and close them,
and should they use black bag ops, set up ways to detect them. The legal
means have now changed.
Absolutely.  You can close most of the holes.  You can make the ones you
can't close harder to use by alarming them and watching them alarms
Doubtful. They've install key catcher hardware in lots of computers to get
spies and mobsters before.  The treasury guys installled a gps tracker in Jim Bell's car, etc.  All these imply black bag jobs are not beyond
them at all.
Sure, but that would be useless for past communications.  If they've
copied your emails before, and now have the key, they have what you wrote
and what you've read.  They don't have future writings, but once they've
broken in to your machine, you can assume they own it.  Depending on how
the bug is installed, simply wiping it might not be enough.
Yup.  Again, back to the threat model. :)

Um, I'm not sure I can follow Choatatian Prime logic here.  Where did
Thomas's posting state that "of course people want to take advantage of
others?"  Then again, it doesn't matter at all.
If your assumption is that all people take advantage of each other, then
it's still "Freedom for me, and Freedom for you" rewritten as "I'm free to
take advantage of you, you're free to take advantage of me."
No, government isn't an emergent behavior of individuals.  It's based on
leaders and followers in certain percentages.  There can be no leaders if
no one is willing to follow them.  But of course this isn't the
case.  Therefore there is some measure of consent on the part of the
followers, whether it was in the form of guns pointed at their heads, or
free choice.  However, once you read up on ants, you'll find, there is no
ant government at all.
I also fail to follow your Choatian-Prime logic that connects "of course
people want to take advantage of each other" to the emergence of
What proof do you have that ants don't have self referential views, or
that humans don't have biological hard wired behaviors?  I in fact did not
make a hypothetis comparing humans to ants, I instead provided an example
where a central authority is not needed.  The hypothesis is that individuals may act in their own self interest, and
still derrive benefits for the group by doing so.  There was no direct
comparison of ants and humans, and I in fact stated that you shouldn't
even attempt to do so.
It's very simple.  This is where evolution in action comes in.  If the
emergent behavior is harmful to the individuals, they will cease to
contribute to it, or cease to exist.  Therefore the rest of the following
paragraph is moot.
Absolutely true.  However that does not in any way take away from my
original point.  Individuals acting in self interest in large groups can
benefit most of the group members, and possibly even outsiders.  You've
yet to come up with a logical counterpoint against this.
But it can, and is very obvious that humans are social - that is that they
interact with other humans for mutual benefit, and that through this
interaction most members of said society will benefit.  Where hermits
living solitarily in caves will toil, societies that work together will
benefit one another - and do so without the need to enslave their members.
Evolution isn't emergence.  They're two distinct theories. They can work
together, just as you can have apples and orages in a fruit salad.  But
they're not the same thing.  However, governments started to exist as soon
as weapons did.
Confusing yourself with others again?  Must suck to be you.
Absolutely correct.  See, you are agreeing with the theory.  Since
altrusim is self interest, everyone is free to help each other to their
own benefit.  I help you with something, you later return the favor with
something else.  Thus is born a contract.  I do X, in exchange you do Y.
Tim helps me with something, you help Tim with something, I help you with
something even out the debt, and thus the sum grows to be bigger than it's
parts, but all of the parts benefit.  I had a contract with Tim, you had a
contract with Tim, we can aggregate them.
So I say, "I'm looking out for my interests, you're free to do the same"
so does Tim, and so does Jim.  As a "society" all its members benefit.  Say Joe comes along and begs for food.  We may help him get some food, but
we'd want something in return later on, thus another contract.  It's still
"Freedom for me and freedom for you."
Say Jeff comes along and puts a gun to our heads and demands all our
food.  At this point, it's "Freedom for Jeff, none for us."

You're confused.  The ability of individuals acting in their own interests does not deny the
ability of a collection of those same individuals from working towards
mutual benefits.  Nor does it deny others who are not acting in those same
interest from benefiting from their work.
What objectivists object to is being bent over to whim or "needs" of
others.  You can't reward need.  You can reward work.
To take this to the other list that you're on (psychohistory), go and find
yourself this book: Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains,
Cities, and Software by Steven Johnson.  Amazon should have it.
It shows (as an example) that individual ants don't act on a central
command.  There is no ant government, no ant leadership.  Rather ants work
by a very simple set of rules that are individual rules, but their actions
form a huge collective effort.  Unlike socialism or communism (in practice
not in theory) there is no need for central authority.
The same is true according to this book of slime mold cells, who work as
individuals, however at certain points, they merge to become one single
While I'm not comparing humans to ants, nor to slime mold cells -- don't
even attempt to make that connection, the lesson here for you to learn is
that individual action performed in the self interest of the individual,
when integrated over a large population shows emergent behavior, and is
beneficial to most members of the group.
You don't need socialism, communism, fascism or religion in order to help
others out.  The drives to survival and self preservation allow us humans
to act together in common interests.  As is does ants, most types of bees
(termite bees for example aren't social.), etc.
For example, mailing lists that are nothing more than a forum for the
exchange of ideas allow for positive communal results.  I would point to
something like bugtraq for example.  In terms of security, there's nothing
out there that has done more to help users of buggy software by simply
reporting that in fact Company M's product W, contains bug X.
Another example: The NTLK (Newton Talk Mailing LisT) provides a very good
forum for users of the killed off platform.  In fact, it has provided
excellent support to the point of the creation of new software that did
not exist when Apple did support it such as BackTalk (which allows Newts
to beam to Palms and vice versa), and ATA card drives allowing Newton
owners access to cheaper PCMCIA cards.
In each of these mailing lists, each actor runs their own algorithm and is
interested in self gain, yet, by having common goals, even without a
central authority, they are able to achieve goals that as individuals
they would not be to.
When someone makes up their mind to take care of themselves and their
interests, they are not preventing another from doing the same.  When someone puts a gun to your head and tells you to "hand over your
valuables, then bend over and grease up", that's "Freedom for me, none for
When someone is minding their own business, working in the pursuit of
liberty and prosperity, they are saying "Freedom for me, and freedom for
When someone says "You have to do as I say" others will say "fuck off"
When that someone pulls out a gun, it's no longer freedom for you and
freedom for me.  It's "I own you as long as I put a gun to your head and
you can't do shit about it if you can't fight back."
When someone says "Help me, I'm starving" that's not an order.  You are
free to chose to ignore or help that person.  If you chose to help them,
you did not deny them their freedoms.  If you chose to ignore them, you
also did not deny them their freedoms.
Back to the subject of ants.
I suppose you've never heard the parable of the ant and the grasshopper,
yes?  If you had, this would be far clearer to you why the communism or
socialism that you suggest doesn't work.
To paraphrase it: All spring and summer long, the ants worked hard and
harvested food.  Meanwhile the grasshopper played his fiddle and enjoyed
himself, but did nothing to secure his own future.  Then winter came.  The ants had food and warmth because they worked all spring and summer
long.  The grasshopper however was starving and froze to death.
Should the grasshopper have been allowed to share in the ant's hard
work after doing nothing all spring and summer long?  If so, then why
should the ants have worked so hard just to allow the grasshopper to be a
burden on them?  If so, why should all the ants have to work?  Maybe they
can take the grasshopper's example, and they can be lazy and find some
other creature to mooch off of...  What happens when there is no one left
to do the work?
Or should the grasshopper have done as the ants?  Assuming the ants said "Fuck off" Who is responsible for the grasshopper's
death?  The ants who didn't share their food?  Or is the grasshoper
responsible for his own failures.
Did the ants decide the grashopper's fate?  Or did the grasshopper decide
his own?  Did the ants force the grasshopper to not set up a nest for
himself away from the cold, or prevent him from collecting food?  Or did
he act on his own?
In terms of morals, why are in your view the ants evil and the lazy
grasshopper good?
Since the ants did not actively interefere with the grasshopper's day to
day modus operandi one way or another, why would you claim the ants are
morally responsible for the grasshopper's death?
Who decided that the grasshopper should not provide shelter and food
supplies for himself, but rather play all summer long?  Did anyone other
than the grasshopper prevent him from harvesting and planning for winter?
Now then, what's this about "freedom for me but not for three?"

Um, rethorical question, but from my very limited understanding of GPS,

frequenies.  Since you need to be outside to be able to use GPS, or at

building something to spoof GPS should be relatively easy.
Seems to me that one could also easily build a system to "brute

Once they have physical access, you're fucked.  Remote access is almost as
dangerous as them having physical access, however it can work in your

more likely to expose the malware to you.
Sure, all of these things are more or less preventable, except for
physical access, and a lot of these come down to trust and reputation.  But reputation and trust are also rubber hose-able (if there is such a

You can trust your best friend until you find out otherwise.  You can

But it's free speech, not music, regardless of amplification, so how does
the ordinance apply?
But in your world, there's nothing anyone can do to stop me, because if
they were to do so, they'd violate my freedom of speech.  If the
constitution applies to all Americans, then only a Russian or other
non-American could tell me to shut the fuck up. Acording to your statement two sentences down from this one, you can't do
shit to stop me as you're an American and the Constitution applies to all
But the 1st ammendment doesn't say "No American shall make no laws
limiting the freedom of the press, etc." It says "Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or
the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
Government for a redress of grievances." Hence the distinction.  There in lies your error and lack of
understanding.  And this is why on private property the property owner decides what is and
isn't allowed.  This is why on public property that belongs to a specific
state or city Congress has nothing to do with it, and the owner may decide
on the rules of the house: "Amendment X The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
So now by muttering something about city ordinances about amplified music
and certain hours, you've just admited that entities other than Congress
may pass laws, and that Freedom of speech can be limited by any other
entity, including: the states, cities, and individuals.

I expect that having a way to prove collusion by checking who praises

observation of current behavior.
Say for instance Mr. Measels manages to accumulate quite a large sum of

I suspect most people would adjust their cached repcap's of him pretty

the following:

Function:	noun
: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of
capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and
by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined
mainly by competition in a free market
(As cut and pasted from Note the words "private" and "ownership" and "goods" which are not
possible in a fascist, communist, or socialist state.
Note the lack of the words "greed" or "belief that $$$ is the primary goal
in life" or "he who collects the most is the best."
All it claims to be is a system that allows private/corporate ownership of
goods where decisions are made by private (versus government) decision and
of course "free market."

So from your reply, I'll assume the answer to my "So are you finally
evolving?" question is still No.
I, and everyone in the world, is aware that commerce != capitalism, and
that you are avoiding the question.  As there are no CACL promoters
(except in Choate') it is not possible for them to suppose
otherwise.  Even in Choate' CACL promoters are aware that commerce !=
Capitalism is of course the system that allows commerce to happen.  Commerce is not legally possible in a communist or fascist system as such
a system does not allow private ownership.
You still have avoided the question of the ants and the grasshopper.  To
quote you again:
So by this answer you are stating that the grasshopper merits death and
the ants merit survival.  There is no amount of twisting you can perform
to escape this, other than a retraction of your statements.
As such a system (a meritocracy) necessitates the reward of those who
perform work and the demise of those who do not, socialism does not fit in
here.  You don't get a C- and get to pass in a meritocracy.  You work and
survive, or don't and die.
One good example of a meritocratic system is capitalism.  You work or you
have money, you make money, you get to buy food, you get to buy/rent
shelter, you get to attract mates and thus propagate.  You don't work and
you have no money, you don't get to survive.
Therefore by your statement above that you have no problem with a
meritocracy, and my statement that capitalism is a meritocracy, you have
to agree that you also have no problem with capitalism.
Notice, I did not say greed.
Nor does Merriam Webster mention greed in the definition of capitalism.

One would hope that the same guys that swore an oath to serve and protect
the laws of the USA would realize that the very first such set of laws was
and is the Constitution.
Certainly power does corrupt, but you've got to think that at one point in
their lives before they became G men, they had it in mind that they were
doing something good and wholesome in working for Uncle Sam, and
protecting Americans and the American Way of Life (as defined by the
Declaration of Independance, the Bill of Rights, etc.)
Unless of course it was a choice between flippin' Big Mac's and workin'
for Uncle Sam... but I digress.. :)
They are supposed to be the good guys after all - serving the law (and by
definition the greatest law of the USA - its Constitution).  You know,
they're supposed to be the ones wearing the white cowboy hats.  The ones
that never start the gun fights, but always win them, the ones that help
old ladies cross the corral... Not the cattle rustlin', horse theiving,
lying, cussin', motherlovin', train-robbin', scandal covering up guys who
in the movies are always wearing black cowboy hats.
Seeing creatures (as in the lore of H.P. Lovecraft) such as Janet Reno,
Lon Hirouchi (sp?) and Jeff Gordon, one wants to walk up to them and ask
"Where did you go astray?  What corrupted you?  Or were you just attracted
to power like a horsefly to fresh dog shit?"

Yes, but someone somewhere is in charge of making the decision that
something is more or less efficient.  How do you measure merit for
instance for literature?  There can be little technical measures.  Sure,
you can measure grammer and spelling, and use of vocabulary, but you
cannot measure creativity by technical means.
Discrimination is simply the chosing of A over B, C, D, and E.  It is not
necessarily emotional.  When someone choses mates, he/she does so by
picking the mate that is most likely to guarantee the sucess of their
When someone has discriminating taste, it means that they aren't likely to
eat at McDonalds.  Further, discriminating between food and poison is a
very good thing and has everything to do with logic.  The goal of every
being is to survive and to produce offspring.  It is therefore a good
thing if that being can discriminate between sweet and bitter
flavors.  Sweet flavors are more likely to provide nutrition whereas
bitter flavors may indicate posion.
Merit simply discriminates between those who have done the work, and
therefore are worthy of the reward, and those who haven't.

This is sooooo 1999...  I've seen port scans as soon as cable modems and

have a firewall, you really had a "network neighborhood" to play with.
What pissed me off is that when I was using Concentric's DSL (XO
now) Windows boxes somehow did broadcasts that strangely enough made it
past the routers (not sure if they're multicasts or what) and advertised
themselves... At first I though these were the usual nmap/strobe attacks, but they
were just on port 139... so that got me curious enough to try and connect
to these boxes.  To my surprise they were full blown windows 9x and 2000
machines in homes where the owner had another machine and shared his/her
local drives with the world!  Anyone from anywhere on the planet could
mount their drives.  So I was nice enough to leave a note on their desktop
informing them of the consequences of their actions.
I doubt that I was the only one who noticed such open hosts, and I'd guess
a lot of these were "owned" pretty quickly...
Oy! Of course these days I refrain from even such cursive curiosities due
to the misinterpretation of these acts by our overzealous friends.

So I was in the 5 train this morning, and in that one subway car I see a
few long white on red stickers that say "all activities on this car may be
recorded"  I didn't go too far through the train, but I did notice the
same sticker in another car.
On a quick look around, I didn't show any cameras, but pinhole cameras
would be easy to hide.  I would have put them in the far corners of the
car somewhere near the top, and you'd probably be able to get a good look
from the round, but flat air conditioner vents, or on the glass covered
displays that state the train destination, but I didn't see cameras or any
obvious smoked glass, or holes.  (My criterial being, "Where would I put
cameras so I would limit the number to one or two per car to keep it
cheap, and still be able to see the whole car?")
Further, I didn't notice any new cables going around, and you'd probably
need lots of them to be able to record video from each car, or a VCR in
each car somewhere...  I guess the next time I'm on one of those trains,
I'll try to be where the conductor is and get a peek inside their cabin...
This is nothing earth shattering as there were cameras in the subway
system for years now, just not on the actual trains.  Still the rachet
does tighten more and more..
Anyone know if these are official, or just someone's idea of a joke?  See
them on any other subway lines?

You keep spewing that the only solution is a democracy, and I keep telling

What exactly is a constitutional one?  Whose constitution?  A constitution
is merely a document that explains the nature of a particular
government.  There's no such thing as a "constitutional democracy" because
any government can claim to be "The People's Free Democractic Republic of
East Bumfuck" -- but usually things named as such turn out to be
socialist or (Russian like) comunist.
Again, I keep asking you over and over about this CACL philosphy you keep
mentioning, and you repeat your lines over and over about how CACL
philosphy has no clue about.  But it seems to me that you're just making
up your own private, and thus incompatible definitions for things again.
1. I would like you to tell us what CACL is - providing defintions.
2. I would like you to tell us what CACL philosophy is.
3. I'd like to offer a correction to you.  Directly from Merriam Webster
here is the definition of Democracy:
1 a : government by the people; especially : rule of the majority Note the specific lack of the words "playing fair" or "constitutional".  Note the inclusion of the words "rule of the majority" again, the
classical example is two wolves and one sheep voting on what's for dinner.
And here I offer the defintion (from the same web site) of a republic:
1 a (1) : a government having a chief of state who is not a monarch and
who in modern times is usually a president (2) : a political unit (as a
nation) having such a form of government b (1) : a government in which
supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is
exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and
governing according to law (2) : a political unit (as a nation) having
such a form of government c : a usually specified republican government of
a political unit  Note again, that we are a republic by the defintion b(1) above.
Incorrect.  Corporations are artificial entities in the eyes of the
law.  This view is supported in most forms of government.  This is why the
heads of corporations don't lose their personal assets when the company
declares bankrupcy.  That business is an activity that people engage in is
no less misleading as saying "government is nothing more than an activity
that people engage in."  It hides the fact that goverments and regimes
have duties and responsabilities, as well as rights, and it also hides the
fact that some are benevolent, while others evil: See for example Nazi
The NFL by the way is a corporation, therefore an artificial entity, and
if you make T-shirts containing their logos or trademarks, you can be
certain that they will excercise their trademark rights as a corporation.
So at that point, you have to admit that corporations do have rights. Just
not the right to directly vote in an election.
I'm not sure what you mean by changing the baby's diapers.  But I'm sure
that there are nanny or pre-school companies out there that do just that,
and therefore there are artificial entities that do indeed change diapers.
Absolutely - in theory everyone has and should vote, but sadly it does
happen.  Less than 50% of our citizens even bother to vote. Possibly the
abundance of dickheads and scum as candidates has something to do with
Of those that do vote, they will of course vote for the candidate that
claims to provide what the citizen is interested in, - and the clueless
vote either for the party they belong to, or the better looking candidate.  Before you even vote, the companies/sig's/lobbies have already made their
donations. And once your senator, representative, governor, mayor, president or other
burrowcrat is in office, the special interest groups can swoon on'em.
Oh, so if a corporation has a policy of donating some of it's profits to
charity, you'd object, because? If a corporation has a policy for giving
some of it's profits to a particular political party you'd object because?  Haven't you heard of fund raisers?  Aren't you free to do with your money
as you chose (so long as the IRS gets paid too?)
Mind you, this is what happens in our form of government, assuming you're
still in Texas, USA, and not inChoatePrime again.
And this is reality.  Good to know you're awake.  If only somewhat.
And who decides what the level of "undue influence" or for that matter
"due influence" is?  Nobody said corporations are handing out bucketfuls
of cash saying "Vote for Jones", but the reality is that they're making
donations to Jones' campaign, helping Jones buy better PR, etc.
But they don't actually vote, I didn't say that the corporation gets to
vote.  I said it was an artificial entity, and has its own rights.  Some
of these include lobbying for its interest - i.e. sponsoring candiates,
advertising, sponsoring research that promotes its products, and of course
protecting it's collective intelectual property, etc. However, again, each
employee or member of the management team can individually vote.  Whether
or not they vote with the same agenda as the company is unknown. But I do
wonder how much that vote gets influenced or not.
Yes, there is a word for that, it's called a "republic." Repeat, a
representative democracy isn't a democracy any more than virtual reality
is reality.  A Representative democracy is a republic.  That's it's
definition.  Quit twisting it.
A mailing list can be considered a society in a very loose sense of the
word.  Shunning does happen on mailing lists, and it happens individually
and has nothing to do with one's wealth, skin color, gender, age, etc.  It
has to do with whether that person is a clueless fuck who keeps insisting
on redefining reality and keeps spewing the same shit over and over again,
and being a general pest.  In such a case, some mailing lists which have
rules in place for it can kick the offender off.  Cypherpunks raw is not
one of them.  Further, each individual recipient is at all times free to
edit their killfiles, mail filters, procmail receipies, etc.
But I do believe I've digressed. :)
Says where?  The DoI says something about the pursuit of happiness, and
how King George was a right old bastard to the colonies and why he was
rejected and why the revolution was about to begin, the constitution talks
about what rights are assigned to congress, the federal government,
states, and to citizens.  No one said "we have to work together to defend
ourselves" or even "we have to provide healthcare, legal aid, food,
clothing, etc. to all" in that document, or the constitution.  Sure
there's mention of a militia and defense in the 2nd, but not that you and
I have to work together to defend ourselves against poverty, poor health,
lawsuits, or boredom, nor are we forced to provide the same to others.
Hold it right there.  I agree with you up until that last word and no
more. This next following paragraph is where I have serious issues with
your view of democracy:
Neither the Declaration of Independance, nor the Constitution provide for
this.  Your assumption clarifies one thing: You're a SOCIALIST, not a
DEMOCRAT.  So from your point of view, you shouldn't be stating that
democracy cures all ills, but rather you should be stating that you wish
for a socialist form of government (which of course is something I
absolutely would loathe.)
What does it mean then?  Food? Shelter? Clothing? Medicare?  Welfare?
What's that if not social programs?  What are those if not socialism's
Says who that I have to provide "the basics" (which you've stated as
health, food, legal, clothing, housing)  for everyone else so I don't
create a hostile environment that will lead to my destruction? Other than
socialists I mean.  Who says that "we" as a country have to do
that?  Again, other than socialists.
And I take extra exception to having to also provide legal care too.  Sure, the court assigns you a free lawyer, but only if you can't afford
your own.  Good luck with that one.  I don't miss the distinction of
providing charity versus paying for someone who is lazy so they can live
for free while I and others work my ass off to earn my pay.  No matter if
they live for free in the projects or in mansions, they're still living
for free, and in your ideal world, I'd be forced to subsidize them via
Sure, but reality isn't "should have" and "should be" there are plenty of
businesses that require arbitrarily silly things such as having to wear a
suit and tie, or having to come in at a certain hour.  Sure, they would
work just as efficiently in casual clothing, or with flexible hours, but
they chose not to.  Sure, they could have even have rules that force the
employees to sing together at every meeting if it makes the owners of the
business happy.  Doesn't mean that such behavior would impact the business
in a positive way - it may make the employees hateful and cause a drop in
performance, but that's too bad.
I find most businesses don't always make the right or proper decisions,
they don't always act when they should, and they try to cut corners to
save a few bucks here and there, but it bites them in the ass.  Still,
what they "should" and what they do are two different things.
By law they cannot discriminate by gender, sexual preference, religeon, or
age.  But they can certainly have you wear a chicken costume to work, or
come in at a certain hour, and they can certainly prevent you from
preeching your beliefs, regardless of the 1st ammendment.  I don't see how
that's "freedom for me, but not for thee" when employment is voluntary.
Yes, but that only applies to government confiscation of goods.  Again, I
do not know anything about what you think CACL philosophy is because there
is no place I can find that says "Here is the cannonical refrence to CACL
philosophy", anyone claiming they are a CACL, or even anyone other than
you merely using that term (except in coversations about your beleifs.)
So where is the connection between "CACL's would let people die of thirst
before interfereing a 'free market' and government confiscation of goods?
In what way is my grasp of the concept of private property lacking?  In
that I do not wish to force others at gunpoint to provide food, shelter,
clothing, health care, and legal aid for me for free?
Ah yes:
Amendment IX
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
construed to deny or  disparage others retained by the people.
Amendment X
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to  the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.
Yes, I can see how clearly Ammendments X and XI say that "The United
States and The States may not grant rights to corporations or
businesses." Uh huh, oh wait, there it is in the inChoatePrime
Constitution.  Mea Culpa.  But in the real world, ours doesn't state any
such thing.  By the very 10th ammendment, the States are granted to give
certain rights to corporations.  Notice that the 9th does state that any
rights not listed within the constitution aren't expressly revoked.  So
one of them includes the right of a group of people to come together for
business purposes and act as an artificial entity known as a corporation,
or LLP, or LLC, a mom-and-pop business, and so on.
But you've obviously got more than enough time to post "CACL philosophy is
evil" and "Plan-9" is good, as well as your personal re-definitions of
what the Declaration of Independance, and the Constitution contain, yes?  Or perhaps you do have plenty of time to respond to this, but are simply
sensing that your logic is flawed, and it's time to make a quick escape
before anyone else notices? :)
It's not rage, it's humor.  I'm enjoying correcting your stupidity. :)
Yes, funny, you are funny, you amuse me, funny how? Like a clown? Yes
exactly. (With apologies to the Goodfellas movie.)

AND Including a democracy.  And therefore, democracy isn't a panacea to
the ills you see in "society." It just happens to be better than the other
systems from the point of view of its citizens, who can say that they are citizens rather than slaves.
Bullshit.  Businesses are artificial entitites.  These artificial entities
are run and composed of management and employees.  Both of these groups
are individually composed of (for the sake of arguement) citizens.  Perhaps inChoatePrime, one may hire chimpanzees, but I digress..
Each of these citizens, whether management or employee has the right to
vote.  You can expect them to vote as they will, and some will vote in a
way that will ensure that the needs and wants of the corporation are
looked after.  Further, the management and emplyees may personally
communicate their desires to those in office, and may even make
donations.  Donations may be made out of personal pockets, or out of the
funds of the corporation.  Like it or not, votes, and representatives are
bought.  To claim that this isn't so, is to stick your head in up your
ass.  Examples are bountiful, with Enron being the latest most visible.
So yes, in a representative democracy which is what we have (aka a
republic) votes can be and are bought.  That it is illegal to do this
outright by paying someone at the voting booth is besides the point.  One
may petition one's representatives at will, and one may make donations to
one's representative.  1+1=2, even for large values of 1.
Irrelevant.  One person is one vote in a democracy, but we are not in a
democracy.  Repeat after me "We are a republic."

Oh, you mean this?
Here are the first two paragraphs you've mentioned.  Note that the
following does not state what kind of government the United States of
America will have - that is done in the Constitution.  This does indicate
the evils that King George perpetrated against the collonies, and the
REASON for our chosen independance.  It does state that the authors
believed certain rights we inalianable, and that whenever any form of
government is destructive to those rights, that it is the right of the
people to overthrow that said government.  It explicitly does not state
that we are a democracy, nor does it state that we are a republic.  Again,
the constitution does that.  Nor does it, nor the Bill of Rights claim
that businesses have no rights.  Other laws, state laws for example,
state the very opposite.  Nor does it mention anywhere that the rights of the minority are protected from the majority (this would not be
true in a democracy anyway!)  Here are the first two paragraphs of the
"DoI" as you call it.
 --- Declaration of Independance ----
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and
to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that  they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to
secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of
Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the
People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form,
as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and
Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing
the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to
reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and
such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former
Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is
a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To
prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
Green=Purple?  No a Republic is NOT a democracy.  In a democracy each
citizen votes on every issue.  In a republic, the citizens elect by vote
those who will represent them.  Repeat after me: A Republic is not a
Democracy.  A Republic IS a representative democracy, that is true.  It is
also true that you don't need a constitution to have a republic, and it's
also true that you don't need one to have anarchy, democracy, fascism,
socialism, communism, monarchy, etc.  True, a constitution does not make
the type of state.  The relationship between a government and its people
does that.

No, I asked you to explain how people are supposed to work openly and

behind each others backs.  You dodged that one by begging the
question.  My point which you've missed is that Democracy or any other
form of government is guaranteed to fail when everyone's cheating, and
that just by sprinkling doses of Democracy, you don't get a utopia any
more than sprinkling doses of Communism or Socialism or Anarchy.
To wit, that Democracy is not a moral system and does not prevent, nor
avoid cheaters, rogues, theives, miscreats, or felons.  Morals do not stem
from the type of government that governs your country any more than they
stem from religeon.
I neither accept nor deny your comment about real anarchies as I have not
lived in one and have no way to judge.  And neither do you, therefore, it
would be wise to not make comments about systems you cannot know about
first hand.
Where does it state this?  Come on, show us the URL to something called
"The Principles of CACL" or "A CACL Manifesto" or whatever the fuck.
IMHO The reason we have corruption is that we are humans, and by nature
humans like taking short cuts, and like making money, and some have
flexible or purchaseable morals.  Every type of government has corruption,
but not because of the type of government, but rather because of human
nature.  Yes, it makes sense that if you do away with government you won't
have competition for power, and thus lessen corruption, but other forms of
corruption will surface.  Scum usually doesn't sink to the bottom of the
Now that is something I can agree to, although I'm uncertain as to which
experiment you are pointing to.  That people will screw each other is a
given.  That there are those who will uphold their morals regardless of
any bribes is also true.  Some people can't be bought, others
can.  Depends on one's morals, not government.
For one thing, it would get rid of assholes climbing to power, abusing
their offices and interns charity at gunpoint (aka taxes), borders and
silly regulations such as the DMCA, and so on.  There will also be a
downside to this such as a lack of road building and an insane system of
tolls, lack of centralized emergency response, and so on.  But I suspect
(and this is just my opinion) that the majority of our taxes do not go
towards these purposes at all.  Perhaps less than 10% do.
I disagree with this.  If there is no power to abuse, no office to
disrespect, no sheeple to mislead, such actions become more difficult.
Same thing that happened in WWI and WWII.  They'll form non-aggression
pacts and support pacts so if that aggressor strikes again, the others

Amazing.  We actually agreed on something after all the
wrangling... wow...
Again, I ask you, WHERE is CACL philosophy presented?  I've yet to see
such a manifesto or declaration of principles of CACL, or reference or any
such thing.  So far, the only mention of CACL revolves around you, and no
one else is claiming otherwise.
As does communism, socialism, democracy, republics, fascism, chicago style
mafia, imperial domains, insane clown possies, and so on.  They're all
pipe dreams until either someone has enough guns to enforce the system and
deal with those who won't play by the rules, or a high enough majority
decides to abide by it.
Stating that anarchy is unworkable or workable is conjecture, and is
meaningless until implemented and attempted.  There is no such thing as
"clear evidence" that anything is a pipe dream until it is tried and it
fails.  Communism for example is a prime example of such a failure.  It's
unworkable for precisely the same reasons that you claim anarchy is
unworkable, and then some.  A pure democracy is unworkable because people
can vote themselves bread and circuses (or see two wolves and one
mutton.)  Socialism fails when the percentage of leeches gets too
burdensome for the workers (as does communism.)
Let's take this further:
As there is no unlimited supply of resources, you need some sort of
economic system to distribute resources to your population.  If you reward
based on need, not on production, then you'll find that the lazy are the
majority and are the neediest, and as your producers produce less and
less, the system collapses.
Similarly with socialism, there comes a point where the percentage of
those on welfare is too high to sustain, and the workers will refuse to be
enslaved by the lazy.  It too will fail.
You can't have theoretical communism where all the workers contribute what
they can and take what they needed because of the same reasons stated
You can't have an immoral anarchy because it will deteriorate into the
Sopranos. :)
Can you have an anarchy where it's everyone for themselves (i.e. no
morals?)  Probably not for too long.  Can you have a moral anarchy?  In
theory anything is possible.  In real life you need some sort of

So what?  Communism looks upon other forms of government as flawed,
dangerous and abusive.  Democracy looks upon other forms of government as
flawed, dangerous and abusive.  Fascisim looks upon other forms of
government as flawed, dangerous and abusive.  Socialism looks upon other
forms of government as flawed, dangerous and abusive.  Hell, if they
DIDN'T, they'd switch their forms of government.

They're all different.  They all have their good and bad points, and in

a communist society when they're all running around cheating behind each

everyone would be honest.  Yeah, uh huh.

Interesting overgeneralization.  If people are not rational, they they are
not rational with or without a government.
Right.  Why don't we change that around a bit with another falacy and
state "Without Christianity to keep people honest, life explodes into a
Hatfield and McCoy escapade."  It's also just as wrong.
Morality, and Ethics are independant of governments, religeons, or
anything else you'd care to throw in there.

where CACL philosophy is?
Yeah, and the majority of the majority of the that count was caused by

Without governments, there would be no wars.  Without wars, the large

Yeah, ok, I guess I know one more person who is a communist and on this
mailing list.  Now kindly, please remove your coloured teeth from my
arsehole Gov'ner.
Thank you for your interpretation of my Colonial upbringing.  Sadly, you are mistaken.  I wasn't born here in the colonies, but rather
in a very communist state that believed itself to be socialist; suffice to
say that I'm very glad to have left it and am an American citizen.
Unlike others US readers of this list who are natural born Americans and
only have a vague hatred of communism from the McCarthy era, without much
of an idea of why, I know that evil first hand.  My hatred of communism,
perhaps unlike your defense of it, is quite justified.
I've never read enough of Ozzie Matt's posts to care, as he seemed beyond
hope.  Choate on the other hand was at times lucid and somewhat logical, so
that's why I've had attempted serval times to provide clues that might
cause improvement.  It did originally get him to stop sending entire web
pages, so there was reason to think it was hopeful.
Perhaps you've been paying attention, perhaps you haven't.  But look in
the archives for posts containing a question to him about the grasshoper
and the ants...  You'll see that he has socialist leanings.  He doesn't
understand the concept that people should be free to chose whether or not
to shun others, that they shouldn't be forced into charity at gun point
and so forth.  Do your homework and you'll find these.
Anyhow, I've lost hope in helping Choate climb out of the bog (shitter for
those of us in the USA) but he apparently likes eating from there.  So I'm
very likely to put him with in next to doormatt.  I've had my fun with
him, and he's obviously beyond help.
I'm not oposed to anyone having a political opinion, nor do I hate them
for having one that differs from mine.  I'm perhaps over outspoken against
communism, but it's not against the person, it's against the idea.
With Jim, I take exception at his actions and lack of brains - yes, that
is a personal attack, but not unfounded.  He claims to be one thing and is
another.  Hence the "socialist with communist leanings" remark - which by
itself wasn't an attack - other things were, but it was meant to point out
and clarify (to Choate himself of course) his political slant because I
suspect he doesn't know what he believes, only that he beleives in it, and
that everyone else is wrong to believe anything else.

Jim: it doesn't matter what address the cypherpunks mailing list runs
out of.  It doesn't matter if it was toad.com in the past and that
happened to be John Gilmore's Toad Hall, listed in DNS as toad.com.  It
doesn't matter if it's cyberpass.net or ssz.com, or lne.com.  This mailing list (which, yes, is distributed via several locations) is
cypherpunks, and its original goals and charter as were listed on the old
soda.berekely.com machine, and whose goals were quoted in the Wired
article were started by a group of folks which included Eric Hughes and
Tim May.  You weren't around at the time.  You have no claim on this list.
The reason the one at toad.com collapsed was because of another asshole
named Vulis (much like your current self and our current aussie doormat
friend) was pissing in the drinking waters.  Yes, Sandy did seek to manual
filter the list, and there was an unfiltered list as well, and yes, Tim
one of the founders threatened to leave the list, and yes Sandy was
cornered when Vulis posted something about his employer.  All that is
true, and we're all aware of it.  That's not important to this discussion.
What is important: the ideas and topics of this mailing list are the same
as the original one at toad.com.  It's address, is now multi-homed.  True.  But this is still a mailing list about cryptography, and crypto
anarchy - that is unrestricted cryptography.  It's not a mailing list that
rehashes slashdot posts, The Register Posts, Plan9 punks, or whatever the
fuck the great mythical godlike Jim Choate happens to read today.
Certainly.  If we ask the delusional Jim Choate, a legend in his own mind,
I'm sure the answer will differ than 99% of those who frequent here.
And which community is that?  The Cypherpunks?  If so, then you should
respect its goals.  Don't agree with those goals?  Perhaps it isn't your
community.  Perhaps you were mistaken.  Perahps you shouldn't be here.
What isn't?  This is cypherpunks.  It was always cypherpunks.  It doesn't
matter than cypherpunks is gone, or was abandoned.  It doesn't
matter that there are other nodes in the CDR.  The CDR is cypherpunks now,
and the original cypherpunks list has moved to the CDR, and the same
reasons and goals that it originally had moved with it.
No one other than you claims that Crypto or Punks requires CACL.  No one
other than you uses that term.  No one, not even you, has any idea what
CACL means.  To date, you've not been able to even clearly define what the
goals and theories of CACL are.  But you and only you keep spitting out on
this list like some sort of magical mantra.
So, yes, it's absolutely true that this mailing list is not about CACL
theories.  It's about cryptography.  It's about anarchy, not in the mad
bomber bullshit common interpretation, but about crypto-anarchy - that is
the unrestricted (by governments) use and availability of cryptography and
cryptographic tools.

does not excuse your spamming this list with bullshit which no one other

repeatedly to get you to correct the way you post news here so that it
would be at least somewhat useful to those who might be interested in it.  You've constantly ignored this, and fell back on "I'm Jim Choate, I run a

Don't give me any bullshit about community.  You're obviously clueless in
its meaning.  Hint: it's not about what Jim Choate wants.  It's about cypherpunks.  And
that includes crypto, crypto-anarchy, and it does to some extent include
libertarian goals, and capitalist goals.  But only to the extent that the
members of this list have those goals.  I'm sure there may even be
communists and socialists (yourself for example) on this list, who wish to
argue their points of view.  And that's perfectly welcome.

That's funny, but whose masked faces were on Wired 1.2?  Certainly yours
was not one of them.  Claiming that you're doing anything other than
running a CDR node (which you piss in) is of course false, which you
haven't directly claimed.
see:  Which leads to the Wired 1.2 Cypherpunks article:
  The string "Choate" is not contained there, though the strings "Hughes",
"May", Gilmore are.  Certainly those strings have far greater positive
reputaion capital than the "Choate" string.  I wonder why that could be?  (I suspect posting slashdot urls over and over is one reason.  Insane
science posts is another.  Lack of reality is yet another.)
Yet another thing I'm not too clear about:
Why do you run a CDR list?
If you are claiming that those who follow the "CACL Theories" (which
you've yet to provide any references to other than your own posts) are
clueless, then why are you running a list node that is dedicated to their
theories?  Whenever I've tried to make sense of your posts, my conclusion
has always been that you are a socialist, possibly with communist
leanings.  Certainly the ideals of cypherpunks as outlined in that Wired
article and on the original text that was at soda.berkeley.edu, are what
you'd consider "muddled CACL thinking"... So why do you run a CDR node?  If you're claiming that the ideals that
Erich Hughes and Tim May forged are "CACL theories" and you disagree with
them, then why run a such a mailing list node?
Ok, so by that line, the silent assumption is that you agree to the text
"your garbage" which it is.  So we can go from there.  It's very simple:
if we'd wanted to read slashdot, we can read it on our own.  If we wanted
to read the onion, we could do the same.
I'm not telling you to stop posting news completeley, because
occasionally, and recently that word has shrunk down to almost never, you
do post an article that is useful.
You have improved in that you're no longer posting the whole
articles.  But the side effect is that now you're posting 10-20 messages a
day which contain nothing but an url to slashdot and the like, and your
signature.  The subject line sometimes hints that there's something there,
but not really.
What would be useful - if you're going to continue this, is if you copied
and pasted say the first paragraph of the article and put in next to the
url, or some bit of information about the article.  But more often than
not, Slashdot itself is worthless; it's usually just a "Hey, go check out
this other article on this other web site." After all, the guys on Slashdot do what you do, which is hand out urls to
other folks.  And guess what? I already read slashdot on a daily basis, so
your slashdot posts are worthless to me.  I suspect, though do not claim
to speak for other members on these linked mailing lists, that a good
majority of them also read slashdot... so those posts are worthless.
So rather than posting a link to to slashdot which is in truth a link to
some other place, why don't you follow their post, go to the source, say
NYTIMES or whatever, post the url to the real story, and say the 1st
paragraph, or some text about why you thought this article would be
relevant to cryptography. (And please, I couldn't care less about Plan 9
posts, or things about your favorite music band, or things unrelated to
cryptography. This isn't after all social-studies-punks.)
And even better yet, why don't you queue up all those articles, and post a
single message with url, and description/sample paragraph.  That way it's
a single message instead of dozens.
Make sense?  After all, the assumption about your posts is that you want
to share something with us, and not just piss in the water we drink.  So
if it's worth sharing, it's worth sharing it in the right way.

I meant filtering spam directly at the MTA, but *MY* MTA, not the CDR node
- i.e. soon as it sees a header that it doesn't like, close the connection
or return an error to the sending MTA, optionally either blocking off the
IP of the sender for some time or acting like a tarpit.
This would also work nicely against spam.  I usually find that various
spams all come from the same IP address.  When I block these off at my
firewall, the spam output drops for a while - until some other idiot picks
up one of the "Put your computer to use" scams...  In terms of being a tarpit, it should probably act as a fake relay to that
IP for the remainder of the time period and fake acceptance of mail to any
receipient, but all emails go straight to /dev/null, very slowly - so that
it doesn't eat up too much bandwith, but enough to be a pain for the
Regarding inchoate and this mailing list, yes blocking off the CDR node
from sending the spam won't work as the mailing list software would mark
your address as bad and after a while unsubscribe you.  Perhaps in that
case the MTA could just accept the mail, but route it quietly to
Weeding out inchoate is as easy as looking for a small sized body that

to other forms of spam, but then that puts the burden on him to adapt.  I

why we should bother to follow his urls has always failed.

Except for one thing - some of us run our own mail servers and pay for the
bandwith.  Sure, I can delete at the server all I want, but, the mail has
to first go through SMTP before it can be chucked.  It's still a waste of
bandwith and processing.
Look at it this way also.  If everyone (call it E for most of the
subscribers) that subscribes to a CDR has to delete the same piece of
email, then you have E*sizeof(spam) worth of wasted bandwith spread
amongst E receivers, and the CDR node has to spend all it's time sending
the shit.
Would be nice if the MTA did spam (and Choate) recognition on the fly.  If anyone has such an MTA, that would be great.
All that filtering does is prevents you from seeing the offending
emails.  They still consume resources.  And should you use pop or imap,

When was the last time you had to give your name when you bought a
newspaper, CD or a DVD in a non-online/non-mail order store?
That is your choice of course, as it is mine to refuse to disclose my
identity for a simple purchase such as a newspaper, CD, or DVD.
Then, you don't understand it at all.  The point of DRM is to prevent you,
the customer from making copies of CD's and DVD's available to others,
skipping over commercials, to limit you from purchasing the same titles
from outside your "region" for much less, or slightly different edits, or
before they're released in your region, or lend the same to your friends,
or transferring the data to other mediums (mp3 players, etc.)
Never mind that copyright laws allow such fair use such as making backups
and loaning to your friends, transfering CD tracks to your mp3 player, and
even selling used DVD's/CD's so long as you destroy all other copies of
the same title.
In order to enforce these ends, the only way to "protect" the rights of
the owner of the copyrighted work, the current proposals deem to remove
administrative rights to your own computer. i.e. MSFT Palladin et al.
At this point, the owner of the copyright has root on your computer.  (Be
that computer a DVD player, X-Box, or whatever.)  Should you have anything
else on that machine, it is accessible surreptitiously by them without
your knowledge so long as the device is online, and it would have to be in
order to be "registered" and "updated."  Hence the complaints of privacy
The number and quality of bits is irrelevant from the point of view of the
MPAA and RIA.  Street vendors of illegal VHS tapes and DVD's made of
movies from a camcorder while in a movie theater have had their asses
rightly hauled in.  I imagine the quality of their wares is also quite
low when compared to legal versions of the same.

The decompression function could be integrated into the videocard
relieving that CPU burden.   Playback is not problematic.
In fact, I recall seeing MPEG decoder cards back in the early days
of DVD ROM's.
Regardless of this ungreatful Choatism whereby we get off the topic of
just how useless or useful old computers are, while we can certainly use
the old fuckers, the question of upgrading has always been: Does it do
what you want?  If the answer is no, then you upgrade.
Sure, you can revive old hardware with Linux, but you'll find it runs KDE
3.0 or GNOME slower than windows 95 did on the same hardware.  So unless
you're willing to also go to older software (or at least less demanding
software) you've still got a useless machine.
OTOH, if it does work well enough, and you don't care for swapping memos
in Micro$loth Word V283.23 with cow-orkers or don't care about watching
the latest 3d movie on XVD disks, then by all means, if you don't mind the
huge power consumption, use that old iron.
Personally, I do have 8 and 9 year old hardware and find it glacially
slow.  While surfing the web with an old Sun Voyager running a whopping
40MHz SPARC V7 is a bit slow, it's fast enough to get the morning news and
weather report as I drink my coffee.  Sure, that old IBM Thinkpad 365x
with a flying fast Pentium 100 (no that's not P3 or P4, or even P2, plain
ol'e Pentium 1) and 48mb of ram running windblows 95 sucks for most
things, it makes a fine MP3 player for my living room, once nice speakers
are attached, and so on and so forth.
As for the Lisa, I haven't powered up that beastie in years.  But, yes, I
could run LisaWrite and print just fine on dot matrix paper off the lovely
ImageWriter II printer.  Uh huh... I'm sure that such a printout would
make a fine resume.  Care to wager on whether such a printed resume would
even render an interview?
No boys and girls, it's the boiling the frog scenario.  If you try to boil
a live frog in an pot at high heat, the frog will jump out.  If you cover
the pot, well the pot will boil over.  So instead, you don't turn the heat
on high.  Rather you keep the heat low, very low, and as the temperature
rises notch by notch, the frog doesn't notice.  By the time the water is
hot, the frog is already dead.  Guess who the frog is?
Same here.  Example:
Want to view DVD's, you gotta buy a DVD player or DVDROM for your PC.  But wait, now you can't watch DVD's you've legally purchased in England
because by contract all DVD players are region specific!  Worse yet, if
you happen to have an old TV that doesn't support RCA in and your DVD
player doesn't have a COAX connection... you can't connect your DVD player
through your VCR, because, guess what, DVD players are bound by contract
to scramble their output with Macrovision and your VCR of course honors
this, so you can't watch DVD's you've purchased in the USA if you have an
old TV!
Never mind that pirates don't even need DeCSS to clone DVD's.  Never mind
that there are plenty of MacroVision remover boxes out there sold as
picture enhancers.  Never mind that none of these things prevent pirates
from copying DVD's.  Never mind that there are "illegal" region free DVD
players out there without Macrovision protection, etc...  No, the whole
point is a legal one brought to you by our friends at the DMCA.  Where a
movie isn't a movie, but a "video device..." right...  So long to your
"Fair Use" right to make a backup copy.  Tough titties if your 3 year old
thought the DVD would be cleaner if washed with sand paper.  You're out
the $30 you've paid for "The Matrix III - Trinity Does Dallas"
So extrapolate, and you'll know what to expect when Palladium and it's ilk
show up.  Want to watch the next version of what will be DVD? You get a big brother
inside chip.  So it goes.  Want to run Micro$haft Orifice 3003 1/2?  Gotta have the TCPMA chip in your Pee Cee.. wait, scratch that, you won't
have admin rights on that PC, so it's really "our PC."  And that copy you
bought, nope, not yours either, you were only sold a "license" to use it.  Part of that license says they can install whatever they want on
your^H^H^H^H^H our PC?  Including back doors?  Including spyware?  Including marketing gathering information?  Yup.  You grabs your ankles
and you spreads your cheeks.
Or, you just vote with your wallet.  Do you really need Orifice 3003 1/2?
Does your current Pee Cee work just fine?  Great, keep using it.  Need to
print a 3d resume in color on holographic paper?  Cough up $80 at Harbucks
and pay for a crappachino grande and 30 minutes of MicroSoft time and type
up your new resume.  Or go the Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD route and raise that middle
finger up proudly.  Will you be able to do just as much?  Probably.  But,
oh wait, we forgot, Uncle Sam has padded his wallet from the likes of the
MPAA, RIAA and that new rule about how no Pee Cee without a big brother
chip inside cannot be sold...  Too bad, that.  I guess Jack Vallenti
wanted to close "The Open Source loophole."  Nevermind that there are
perfectly legal uses for linux enabled machines, but "we must close the
open source hole - or they'll compile their own software!"
But wait, what was I thinking, you can't even pay $80, because by now if
you don't have a Microsoft Passport, you don't have a Micro$haft Visa
Social Security Implant(tm).  You don't exist!
Yes, you're right; probably it will never get that far.
Then again, we also thought that only congress could declare war, that
people captured on a battle field carring weapons and shooting at our
soldiers were POW's.  We also thought that in the USA any person arrested
and suspected of a crime was entitled to a lawyer, and a trial, but
defining a new class of criminal called "terrorist" who have no right to
even talk to a lawyer of family and don't have to be charged with a crime,
and go before a military sham tribunal.

Fine, have it your way:
Yeah? Which gnome? 1.0?  I wasn't concerned much about internet throughput
as much as display rendering of shit like rendering menus and such.  Oh, what, did you expect me to use Lynx maybe?
Let's also not forget that the older machines have limits on memory, which
also affect performance.  I don't know about your hardware, but most of my
old 100-200Mhz machines don't have motherboards that can handle much ram.  I'd be lucky to get 128mb in there -- if I were to bother hunting down ram
for them and paying a lot more per megabyte for it than for say a pair of
512M dimms for the newer boxes.  And no, I'm not going to be spending $200
on an accelerated 3d video card with 8mb for a piece of shit machine from
10 years ago either.  So yes, gnome is slow on old hardware.
Power consumption per MIPS.  Do the math.  That old 200Mhz box is costing
you as much more in MIPS/Watts than your 1GHz box.  Unless of course
you're comparing notebooks with fully loaded towers. :)  My old piece of
shit Pentium 1 box which has a 250Watt power supply.  Same as my newer
machines.  Which is more expensive to run, hmm?  Now lets say that you
take every machine you've ever had and run them all at the same time.
How much aggregate MIPS will you get out of them versus how many
Watts/hour would you be using?   Will those be servers of some sort?  Oh,
ok, that means you'll need more UPS's.  What?  You don't have
UPS's?  Silly man! I've got UPS's on practically everything. Yes, yes,
including the Tivo and my alarm clock.  Two 3+ hour blackouts was more
than enough to convince me.  Hell, I was pricing generators right after
that, but thought a few large UPS's would do the trick.
Certainly that old Pentium tower makes a fine firewall, DNS, mail, or
printer server, or low bandwith web server, but for how much longer?  At
what point does it become useless?  Certainly were I to bother encrypting
everything on it, disk, swap, and network connectivity, it would slow down
to Commodore 64 levels of usability.  And how many users do you have going
through it?  Just yourself perhaps?
Ever notice how much slower it is to ssh to that old 100Mhz PC of yours
than to the 1Ghz one?  the initial connection takes far longer to
complete?  Maybe you haven't, I have.
Perhaps you need more caffeine in your blood stream.  Seems to me your IQ

Ok Mr. Smarty Pants Aarg! Anonymous remailer user, you come up with such a
method.  Cypherpunsk write code, yes?  So write some code.
Meanwhile, this is why it can't be done:
If you have a client that sends a signature of it's binary back to it's
mommy, you can also have a rogue client that sends the same signature back
to it's mommy, but is a different binary.
So how does mommy know which is the real client, and which is the rogue
After all, the rogue could simply keep a copy of the real client's binary,
and send the checksum/hash for the real copy, but not run it.
If you embedd one half of a public key in the real client, what's to stop
the attacker from reverse engineering the real client and extracting the
key, then sign/encrypt things with that half of the key?  Or to patch the
client using a debugger so it does other things also?  Or runs inside an
emulator where every operation it does is logged - so that a new rogue can
be built that does the same?  Or runs under an OS whose kernel is patched
to allow another process to access your client's memory and
routines? Or has modded dynamic libraries which your client depends on to do the same, etc.
Show us the code instead of asking us to write it for you.  I say, you
can't do it.  Prove me wrong.  As long as you do not have full exclusive
control of the client hardware, you can't do what you ask with any degree
of confidence beyond what security through obscurity buys you.  In the
end, if someone cares enough, they will break it.
All this pointless bickering has already been discussed:  A long while

How do you propose to have a client run in a hostile environment and
securely authenticate itself without allowing rogues to take over it's
function or mimic it?
Either propose a way to do what you're asking us to do - which IMHO is
impossible without also having some sort of cop out such as having trusted
hardware, or go away and shut the fuck up.

It is possible to do the rest of this if you manage to secure the machines
from any other kinds of access by disabling all services other than that
particular p2p (to prevent remote access overflows from insecure
applications).   If you see the network problem as a multi-ended VPN,
that's the next part.
But I do not see any way for any member of the network to certify that any
other node is running exactly the same software, unless all nodes restrict
access to the hardware and have an external certification process.  If
anyone anywhere can grab the software - binary or source and join the
network while still having hardware access, all bets are off.  The only thing the other nodes can certify is that the crypto signatures
are right, and that the protocol is the same.  But even if you sign the
binaries, you don't know that the thing at the other end has the signature
it just sent you.
You can try to make things complex such as pushing binaries to the other
node and having them run there, but you don't know if you're inside a
VMware box, or Bochs emulator, or a real machine.
Even if you can certify that the application does what you think it does,
you can't ceritfy that the operating system or the hardware isn't going to
do anything else.
End of story.  Can't be done so long as anyone other than you has root on
the machine, or has physical access.  Hence you need to buttplug the
hardware and make it difficult to modify.  Even so, you don't have any
idea of if that CPU really is what it says it is, or that the hardware
will do what you think it will do.  Hardware can be replaced or patched
with things that can look like the original, or things that at some
opportune moment interrupt and switch out that hardware, then get full
access to all the ram.
No, I couldn't afford such hardware mods.  But say someone that has enough
money to own a DVD pressing factory certainly can afford the R&D.  In the
end TCPA/Palladium will be broken.  Just the USG kept pushing single DES
until even a bit after the DES cracker got built.
I've no problem with that, nor the fact the RIAA/MPAA want to protect
their warez - if they get that oppresive, I won't be buying it, and I'm
positive that others won't either...  In the end, they'll just be burning
a lot of money and find out that they'll go broke.  Ironic? Yup.  As long
as it's a free market, they'll fry for pissing off their consumers.
I do have a problem with having spyware forced down my machines by John
Law.  Intel wants to put Pd compliant chips in their mobo's, fine, I won't
buy their hardware -- or if I do, I'll be sure to reflash the BIOS to a
slightly different enough version without signatures to force the Pd chip
to shut down... If it won't let me, their loss.  There's still AMD.  AMD
joins intel?  Fuck x86, there's still Sun, and Apple.  The only way that Pd will be successful is if every hardware manufacturer
is forced by law to include it.  And I've no problem with MSFT making
their software oppresive, they're just digging their own graves, I'll
applaud as they sink in to the bog.  Fuck'em.  They're extinct.
Long as the motherboard will let me boot whatever OS I want, long as
Kongress keeps their paws out of my machine and doesn't extract a tax to
pay the losers for their "losses", MSFT, Intel, MPAA, RIAA can do whatever
they want.
And no, I don't believe that making an open source, hardware free version
of what they're trying to do will prevent Jackoff Vallenti from pushing
dollars to kongress to close the PeeCee hole while sucking Bill Gates's

In the end, the only guarantee you have is that the thing at the end is

security on both machines is decent enough to prevent them from being

You can only do this if you can trust the hardware.  As long as any
potential untrustworthy folks have access to that hardware, it cannot be
It is possible to do the rest of this if you manage to secure the machines
from any other kinds of access by disabling all services other than that
particular p2p (to prevent remote access overflows from insecure
applications).   If you see the network problem as a multi-ended VPN,
that's the next part.
But I do not see any way for any member of the network to certify that any
other node is running exactly the same software, unless all nodes restrict
access to the hardware and have an external certification process.  If
anyone anywhere can grab the software - binary or source and join the
network while still having hardware access, all bets are off.  The only thing the other nodes can certify is that the crypto signatures
are right, and that the protocol is the same.  But even if you sign the
binaries, you don't know that the thing at the other end has the signature
it just sent you.
You can try to make things complex such as pushing binaries to the other
node and having them run there, but you don't know if you're inside a
VMware box, or Bochs emulator, or a real machine.
Even if you can certify that the application does what you think it does,
you can't ceritfy that the operating system or the hardware isn't going to
do anything else.
End of story.  Can't be done so long as anyone other than you has root on
the machine, or has physical access.  Hence you need to buttplug the
hardware and make it difficult to modify.  Even so, you don't have any
idea of if that CPU really is what it says it is, or that the hardware
will do what you think it will do.  Hardware can be replaced or patched
with things that can look like the original, or things that at some
opportune moment interrupt and switch out that hardware, then get full
access to all the ram.
No, I couldn't afford such hardware mods.  But say someone that has enough
money to own a DVD pressing factory certainly can afford the R&D.  In the
end TCPA/Palladium will be broken.  Just the USG kept pushing single DES
until even a bit after the DES cracker got built.
I've no problem with that, nor the fact the RIAA/MPAA want to protect
their warez - if they get that oppresive, I won't be buying it, and I'm
positive that others won't either...  In the end, they'll just be burning
a lot of money and find out that they'll go broke.  Ironic? Yup.  As long
as it's a free market, they'll fry for pissing off their consumers.
I do have a problem with having spyware forced down my machines by John
Law.  Intel wants to put Pd compliant chips in their mobo's, fine, I won't
buy their hardware -- or if I do, I'll be sure to reflash the BIOS to a
slightly different enough version without signatures to force the Pd chip
to shut down... If it won't let me, their loss.  There's still AMD.  AMD
joins intel?  Fuck x86, there's still Sun, and Apple.  The only way that Pd will be successful is if every hardware manufacturer
is forced by law to include it.  And I've no problem with MSFT making
their software oppresive, they're just digging their own graves, I'll
applaud as they sink in to the bog.  Fuck'em.  They're extinct.
Long as the motherboard will let me boot whatever OS I want, long as
Kongress keeps their paws out of my machine and doesn't extract a tax to
pay the losers for their "losses", MSFT, Intel, MPAA, RIAA can do whatever
they want.
And no, I don't believe that making an open source, hardware free version
of what they're trying to do will prevent Jackoff Vallenti from pushing
dollars to kongress to close the PeeCee hole while sucking Bill Gates's
balls simultaneously.
In the end, the only guarantee you have is that the thing at the end is
talking the same language as you and that anyone else can't snoop the
traffic and see what's there - so long as your crypto-fu is good, and the
security on both machines is decent enough to prevent them from being
owned.  So why bother?
Just because the evil empire is running at full speed towards the
precipice doesn't mean we need open source versions of the same insanity

Investigating the leakage of that email or phone call, whatever it was is
secondary, and worthless.  The bottom line is that our entire law

if there are Arab rich neighborhoods?  Are we to resort back to WWII nazi
style concentration camps of Arabs just because less than 0.01% of the

If anything such detailed micro-scrutiny of the Arabs will cause those
very same Arabs who have not joined Al Qaeda to foster anti-USA
resentment, and join the terrorists.  It's utterly stupid.
They should have been infiltrating Al Qaeda ten years ago when it wasn't a
threat.  They should have whacked Bin Ladin years ago.  Instead, he's
being paraded around like the Emmanuel Goldstein character of 1984.

The problem with these stop crackers and hackers by law is that it allows
software developers to get away with leaving huge gaping security holes
unfixed.  Anecodatal evidence: The classic well known Robin Hood and Friar
Tuck "hack".
These days, the bug wouldn't get fixed and the guys reporting it would
wind up in jail because they "convinced" the OS authors to fix the
bug.  IMHO, not the right way to go at all.
from scroll down a bit more than half way down the page (also available from most other GNU sources)
     Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at
     Motorola discovered a relatively simple way to crack system
     security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system.  Through a simple
     programming strategy, it was possible for a user program to trick
     the system into running a portion of the program in `master mode'
     (supervisor state), in which memory protection does not apply.  The
     program could then poke a large value into its `privilege level'
     byte (normally write-protected) and could then proceed to bypass
     all levels of security within the file-management system, patch the
     system monitor, and do numerous other interesting things.  In
     short, the barn door was wide open.
     Motorola quite properly reported this problem to Xerox via an
     official `level 1 SIDR' (a bug report with an intended urgency of
     `needs to be fixed yesterday').  Because the text of each SIDR was
     entered into a database that could be viewed by quite a number of
     people, Motorola followed the approved procedure: they simply
     reported the problem as `Security SIDR', and attached all of the
     necessary documentation, ways-to-reproduce, etc.
     The CP-V people at Xerox sat on their thumbs; they either didn't
     realize the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
     operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an
     official patch.
     Months passed.  The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox
     field-support rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take
     direct action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily
     the system could be cracked and just how thoroughly the security
     safeguards could be subverted.
     They dug around in the operating-system listings and devised a
     thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
     incorporated into a pair of programs called `Robin Hood' and `Friar
     Tuck'.  Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as `ghost
     jobs' (daemons, in UNIX terminology); they would use the existing
     loophole to subvert system security, install the necessary patches,
     and then keep an eye on one another's statuses in order to keep the
     system operator (in effect, the superuser) from aborting them.
     One fine day, the system operator on the main CP-V software
     development system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of
     unusual phenomena.  These included the following:
        * Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the
          middle of a job.
        * Disk drives would seek back and forth so rapidly that they
          would attempt to walk across the floor (see {walking drives}).
        * The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of
          itself and punch a {lace card}.  These would usually jam in
          the punch.
        * The console would print snide and insulting messages from
          Robin Hood to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.
        * The Xerox card reader had two output stackers; it could be
          instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A
          (unless a card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was
          placed into stacker B).  One of the patches installed by the
          ghosts added some code to the card-reader driver... after
          reading a card, it would flip over to the opposite stacker.
          As a result, card decks would divide themselves in half when
          they were read, leaving the operator to recollate them
          manually.
     Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.
     They found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them... and were
     once again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following
     sequence of events took place:
          !X id1
          id1: Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!
          id1: Off (aborted)
          id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff
               of Nottingham's men!
          id1: Thank you, my good fellow!
     Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been
     killed, and would start a new copy of the recently slain program
     within a few milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to
     kill them simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash
     the system.
     Finally, the system programmers did the latter --- only to find
     that the bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It
     turned out that these two programs had patched the boot-time OS
     image (the kernel file, in UNIX terms) and had added themselves to
     the list of programs that were to be started at boot time.
     The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when
     the system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and
     reinstalled the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a
     patch for this problem.
     It is alleged that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management
     about the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.
     It is not recorded that any serious disciplinary action was taken
     against either of them.

Oh get over it.  There are other formats.  You ever heard of
XML?  HTML? RTF?
If the day comes where MS Office DRM only works with MS Office DRM, how
many people will switch to it?  If your company is willing to switch to
it, then they'll give you a PC with it on it.  If they don't, then they
can't expect you to interact with them via such formats and can't require
you to do so.
You sound like someone's holding a gun to your head and requiring you to
have MS Office.
Either way, you can ask them to export to other document formats which you
can read.  Even now Office will export to HTML for example which is
readable by Mozilla and other browsers.
Microsoft is not the DMV.  You don't need to use their software.
And no, I will never be part of your problem because the documents I will
create for non work use will be made with Open Office or will be plain
text, html, or xml files.
If I'm required to use a DRM'ed Office for work, then fine, my company
owns those documents anyway and they can do whatever the fuck they like
with them either way.   It doesn't matter to me at all -- it's their call,
it's their company, it's their documents.
But, for personal use, I won't buy any upgrades or new Microsoft
software.  End of story.
Either way, how much a revolt do you think there will be if Microsoft
decides to lock down their tools (such as word) to the point where they
can no longer export to HTML, plain text, RTF should the author wish it to do so and provides whatever passphrases or ID's needed to unlock
the document and export it out?
Who would buy such a dog of a product?  Do you think businesses are so
stupid that they'd put up with a product that jails them in?  Get real
son, you're howling at the moon!
On one hand you're bitching that you have to use Microsoft software on the
other you're complaining that I'm using it while I'm telling you I don't
want to and don't care to and won't upgrade to it.
You want to make a difference?  Go ahead, wipe every bit of Microsoft
wares off all your machines and burn the CD's you've installed them
from.  Go all open source and show others the right way.  I'd
have some respect for you for voting with your wallet and practicing what
you preach.
Right now all you're doing is bitching that you're forced to buy and use
Microsoft Office.  I say that's bullshit, and you know it.

Compatibility you say?  Well, that's your choice.  You can decide if it's
important enough to you and act accordingly.  I personally think MSFT is
evil, and provides nothing but mediocre software.  So I vote with my
wallet by not paying them for their junk and I won't buy upgrades of their
software if the previous versions do what I needed, and install Linux and
OpenBSD on new machines.
Yes, some of the older shittier machines I have run Windows, but that's
because I'm either too lazy to track down drivers for Linux or want them
to continue running what they run.  Doesn't mean I have to go to XP or
Yes, my work machine runs win2k, but I didn't pay for it, and I didn't
have much choice in it - actually I could either quit and find a new job
(really lots of fun in this economy) or reinstall Linux over it and live
with Open Office and other open tools or have paid for Crossover office
out of my pocket, etc.  Wasn't worth the trouble and we already have a
site license for win2k + office 2k, so that's the path I went.   Not my
money, the company's money.  They chose to pay the Redmond Beast, so what
do I care?
But for home use, I have no real use for much more than OpenOffice and
Linux.  There's no need for me to pirate garbage from Microsoft.  I can
live without it.  These are some old pentium1- 100Mhz notebook machines I have that came
with Windows 95 and 98 - turd OS's really, but they serve a purpose - mp3
players and light web surfing in my living room and other places for
example.  And before you ask, no, I didn't pirate the mp3's.  They're all
ripped from CD's that I owned, and I still have the CD's as proof of
ownership.  Yes, I could go to linux on them, but why bother wasting half
a day tracking down drivers and tuning kernels for them when they're
already built and working the way I want them to?
So why do you feel it's required of you to either pay Microsoft for, or
pirate Office XP and Server 2003 and TCPA enabled junkware?  What's so
important that you can't live without them.

Indeed.  If it's coming from Redmond, and as usual if it smells of evil, there is
an utterly simple solution in dealing with it:  don't buy it.  Don't buy
Microsoft software, don't buy motherboards that include TCPA capabilities.  When you're up for getting yourself a new PC, get a generic one without
such options, or if you insist, call the vendor and tell them you want a
box without evil-inside and without a Redmond OS pre-installed.
Buy a generic intel/amd machine without the "Secure" processor, or give
Steve Jobs some of your cash for a nice G4/G5 machine, or you can go to a
generic PowerPC motherboard and run Linux, or you can go to McNeally's
shop and buy an UltraSPARC, etc.  There are plenty to choose from.
If you find uses for TCPA, by all means, have fun.  If you think Microsoft's secured from you OS platforms are the way to go
for you, by all means, Ballmer and Gates surely could make better use of
more of your cash than you can.
Vote with your wallet.  The market will ultimately dictate what M$ will
and will not sell in regards to operating systems, digital rights
management, application suites, and so forth.  End of story.

Yup, but you don't have to splice a tape, you can do it all digitally
these days, then create a signle low quality audiotape recorded so poorly
that your analyst won't be able to acurately say yes or not.
The real question is whether or not you can have a speech synth that can
put out convincing inflections, pauses, um's ah's, coughs, etc. to the
point that it sounds like a human with emotions, not a machine.  You can
get the samples from existing speeches/addresses and extract just the
phonemes.  Your speech synth's output shouldn't sound like a bunch of
clips of words of course. :)
I don't know how many phonemes would be required for a convinging Iraqi
leader...  For English there's like 30 something...  If you get them all
at the same tone from the same speech, you're set.
If you've ever played with MacOS's speech synth, they have some that are
somewhat realistic human voices, but they still speak with out human
sounding rythms - rather they sound like a human trying to imitate a
computer a la old Star Trek episodes. Add the inflections to get emotion
like sounds, and increase the quality of the synth so you don't hear
machine artifacts, and you're set.  It's not an easy problem, but neither
is it impossible.
As to DNA: Uh, I was talking about Sadam's palaces - lots of skin flakes,
clothes, hairs in combs, etc to be had there.  Ok, well that presumes that
sufficient samples were collected before the nice palace parties. :)

employees have been accused of serious civil rights and civil liberties
violations involving enforcement of the sweeping federal antiterrorism law
known as the USA Patriot Act.
The inspector general's report, which was presented to Congress last week
and is awaiting public release, is likely to raise new concern among
lawmakers about whether the Justice Department can police itself when its
employees are accused of violating the rights of Muslim and Arab
immigrants and others swept up in terrorism investigations under the 2001
The report said that in the six-month period that ended on June 15, the
inspector general's office had received 34 complaints of civil rights and

credible, including accusations that Muslim and Arab immigrants in federal
detention centers had been beaten.

I'm not 100% sure what you're talking about, but from what I got, it
depends on the firewall type, and the location of the man in the middle.  Various firewall types:
Simple packet filters.
Slightly smarter packet filters that also do NAT and keep track of
connections - (this is needed for the NAT to work because it needs to
change the src/dest ports to differentiate between hosts behind the
NAT's.  i.e. ipf, iptables, etc...)
Application layer proxies (i.e. socks, etc.) but those that validate the
traffic is what's its supposed to be. (stateful inspection.)
Generally your attacker needs to own a router upstream from you to be
sucessful in replay attacks.  But if you use a secure encrypted transport,
it gets much, much harder.  (i.e. encrypt the payload, not just the
If the attacker is just somewhere else on the wild internet, he can send
you packets with forged src addresses, but he won't be able see the
replies, so at most it's a denial of service on your machine.
So your attacker needs to either use his real ip address (or one of a
machine he already cracked) or he needs to own the router directly
upstream from you (i.e. your ISP) so your packets don't have any path to
go through but through him.
If he's on your network, or directly upstream, he can do something called
tcp-hijacking.  There is some interesting related stuff here for you to
research to get you answers regarding this:
There are possible ways around this issue, but would likely require an
encrypted sessions (ipsec, ssl/tls, or ssh for example.)
If you just have a simple packet filter, it's possible to use such things.  If you have a hardened application layer proxy server that inspects
packets, you can be a bit more secure.
An important thing to implement is secure tcp sequence numbers.  They make
the sequence # predictions harder, so it's not so easy hijack the
But this depends on your OS and tcp/ip implementation:
The best paper on this I've seen so far:
And here's some security alerts regarding weak sequence  for example:
Again, if your attacker owns the router directly upstream from you, that
won't help very much because you can assume that they'd be able to
intercept and alter packets in real time.  This of course isn't trivial,
but it is doable with fast enough hardware if located directly upstream
from you.  But it won't allow the attacker to hijack encrypted connections to known
hosts, or hosts using properly signed (by a well known CA) SSL
certificates.  It will allow the attacker to do plenty of monkeying with
your email (both inbound and outbound), DNS, and unencrypted web traffic,
and possibly ssh sessions to machines you haven't logged into before
(where you have to say "Yes, this is the machine I want to login to.")
(He won't be able to do much against encrypted emails, but he can always
frustrate you by deleting them or slightly altering them so they fail to
decrypt, so if you're clueless, you'll go to plaintext believing that
this encryption stuff is too much of a headache and it's unreliable, and
he'll be able to monkey with the plaintext ones.)

You could get one of those power strips with a power button intented to be
operated by foot.  Provided you've encrypted everything on your system
including all network traffic and swap, pushing the big red switch should
do the trick. :)
Not exactly an open source solution, but it may well be effective.  In all likelyhood the flashbang armored ninjas with automatics, night
vision, "get the fuck on the floor and shut the fuck up bitch" entry will
happen while you're asleep, so you won't have time to hit the big red
button anyway.
So, the best way to avoid that situation and not being able to reach the
big red switch, is simply not to attract their attention in the first
place by not following the footsteps of Jim Bell.  :)
A more likely, and far more important, scenario to worry about is the
black bag job whereby a hardware keystroke recorder can get installed
without your knowledge...
There may be ways to prevent/detect this...  Software (open or closed
source) alone won't help very much.

Absolutely.  Which is why people worried about security in this manner,
should move to LCD's. Not just for weakening TEMPEST signals, but also for
defeating optical TEMPEST... (and saving power.)  However I have to say
that from a purely user point of view, I like the way CRT's look much
better than LCD's.  CRT's tend to be richer and brighter than LCD's, and
their refresh rates are much better...
LCD's are still suceptible to TEMPEST monitoring, though there are far
less emissions since there isn't this great big nuclear particle
accelerator sitting infront of you :) (what? electrons are nuclear
particles. :)  But the signals from poorly shielded VGA cables can still
be picked up (as can those of keyboards, and other hardware.)
Other tricks include using more than one monitor (make sure they're all
the same brand/model, attached to video cards that are identical and
operating at the same resolution, depth, and refresh rate, and displaying
random junk, etc. + using tempest fonts on the non-decoy system.)
Better yet, use a notebook computer on battery power (so that power saving
mode comes intoplay) with several decoys as they'd (generally) dump much
less RF.  You could also add some shielding, but it's unlikely to help
very much...
I actually played with a fox & hound kit one day.  For those who never had
to run ethernet (CAT 3,5,5e,etc.) or phone cable, this consists of a pair
of tools: a tone injector that makes lots of noise, and a detector.  The
detector can pick up not just the signal from the tone injector, but also
lovely things such as 60Hz hum, phone conversations (in analog phones
anyhow), etc...  You can also learn to "hear" the different sounds various
things like 100BTx make and distinguish from - say, 10BT, or cable TV,
etc... with a cheap proble that doesn't filter...
I did find that when used on a keyboard, with some cheaper keyboards
anyway, you can "hear" the keystrokes and the key scanning pattern, and
that the individual keys are certainly distinctive enough - you could
probably hook this thing up to a sound card and figure out which keys send
what RF pattern...
So with the right recorder/relay/decoder hidden under someone's desk, you
could capture their keystrokes without disturbing epoxy or taking the
keyboard apart.  (As with all bugs, you'd need a power suply, some way to
intercept the data, and either some way to record the data, or relay it.  Relaying it, and hooking into existing power is better than just recording
it or using a battery as a source, because you don't need a 2nd blag bag
job to remove your bug and dump the data.)  Of course if the bug
transmits, it can be picked up in a sweep, but if the PC is on, the guy
doing the sweep might not realize that there's a bug since the PC is a
noise source... YMMV, etc.
So all this talk of expoying keyboards down is somewhat naive in light of
this.  Not to say that if you, hypothetically speaking, were in a position
to have a well funded, and determined set of enemies who were out to get
your data, that using expoxy to glue down your keyboard wouldn't frustrate
them, but rather to point out that there are other means and methods that
would more than ruin your day.  :)
The path of least resistance, again, is not to attract the attention of
such enemies in the first place.
But hey, if your threat model is your kid sister or RIAA, then much less
thought is perfectly fine.
[As with all my posts, "you" is always a fictional character, and in this
one, "you" switches from the guy trying to steal data to the guy trying to
protect data, YMMV,   ]

Well, ok, it "all depends on your security model" is certainly the 1st
factor to consider with how much you're willing to spend on it being a
constraint to that.
If your threat model is simply to have generic good security incase
someone steals your machine, then so long as all your files are encrypted,
the theif just gets whatever the hardware is worth at "it fell of a
truck" prices, and no more.
If your threat model is the fully armed and armorded ninja attack at
3:00am -- which was what I gathered was what Sampo's originally presented
question, then you can assume your attacker would have enough resources to
pull off a TEMPEST van across the street, etc.
So do you want crypto to keep a rogue government out of your fiels, or
keep your kid sister from reading your email? etc...
An on screen virtual keyboard is much easier to see than a real keyboard
even by a shitty pinhole camera.  A real keyboard would have to be viewed
from above, otherwise, all you can do is infer the keystrokes - which
gives you a hint of what they are for a passphrase, but not much else.  On screen keyboard can be seen much easier and your mouse pointer gives
you away.
So it all depends on who "they" is.  Either way, if "they" believe you are
a nice jucy target, and their chances to net lots of data off your machine
are high, they will park the TEMPEST SUV outside your door.  Not much
question of that...
If "they" are watching everyone for patterns and you don't stick out like
a sore thumb, there's not much need for any of the above.
No, virtual keyboard won't save your ass.  Your ISP will had it over on a
plate along with trimmings (traffic logs, etc.)  If you're sharing MP3's
on Kazaa, you're easy to find, and logs are proof enough.  All the RIAA
troll has to do is download one song off your IP, prove it came from
your IP, and get the ISP to give them logs, and you're toast.  Doesn't
matter that your hard drive has since been wiped or encrypted or is
Using crypto to protect files you have already shared with the public is
neurotic as a security measure.
And if you do and are noticed, "they" will spend that money because you
will be an obvious and clear target.  If they can get away with "why don't
you just show us what you have - what do you have something to hide?" line
to cow sheeple into giving them access, in their mind, you'd be the one to
make their careers.
Again, what's your threat model, who is your attacker, how much are you
willing to spend on it?

Geez!  You guys have the DUMBEST ideas ever!  For fuck's sake, go and
RTFA! (For the dumb: READ THE FUCKING ARCHIVES!)
Anything displayed on your screen is visible to the guy across the street
with a TEMPEST detector unless you work in a Faraday cage.  Failing that a
hidden pinhole camera, or an RF transmitter attached to your cable -- hell
these are available for hobbist use right now: x10.com has small devices
that you can use to broadcast video from one room to another.  Getting the
same done for VGA, XVGA, etc. shouldn't be any harder.
Using IR or RF is one of the stupidest things you could possibly
do.  Think!  IR and RF are detectable from a distance!
Ok, some IR auth is ok, provided it's in a sealed chamber and no photons
leak out.  i.e. think of a two cylinders, sealed at the ends where the
cables go, where one fits inside the other... sort of like fiber optic
cables and connectors.  No leaks.
Direct contact's obviously fine, so long as your alleged attacker can't
tap into it.

Yes supposedly, he went out to one of his regular walks and was found with
a slash wrist.  Something I'd imagine someone bent on offing themselves
would have a) a reason to do it (and be depressed or showing signs of
something being wrong), b) wouldn't go out on their normal walk which
they'd do every day, c) would do it in their home, or some place private,
and d) would have a note, e) would have left a will, f) be giving
away money and possessions to others ahead of time, etc...
Where was the knife, or razor or whatever "he used?"  Was
the cut done in a way that he could have done it himself?  I think I
remember it was on his left wrist, but am not sure, if so, was he a
righty, etc....
The normal walk is a very good indicator of just what "this" was.  Someone who wanted to kill him could easily use this as a predictable
pattern as to when and where to grab him and kill him.  Maybe he was
drugged so he wouldn't struggle and be able to get help before getting his
wrist slashed, etc.
This was extremely badly done, regardless of how many "independent
inquiries" Mr. Blair launches to cover it up^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H investigate
it, it's very blatant, and unbelieveable.  I'd tend to agree that this was
done to send a message out, and the suicide and "inquiry" B.S. will be
about as useful as the JFK assasination board, with far less of a media
eye on it.
Either way, Blair's credibility with the whole Iraq and Nukes is
fucked. This "suicide" adds a huge dark streak to his career...  Then

a good quality speech synth?  I wonder if recording it on a cheap tape
with a microphone will remove all traces of it being fake.  The hard part
will of course be getting the inflections right.
Perhaps if you tie a speech recognition system with a speech synth, the
recognition system might be able to detect inflection, tone, and rate, and
provide hints to the synth?  Wouldn't even have to work in real time.

Yup.  I got the fuck out of NYC as fast as I could.  Walked for about 3
hrs incl. over a bridge. :)  Made sure I got there before dark.  I
outwalked the busses!  That's how bad traffic was for cars.  The bars were already happy places at 5pm with lots of crowds in front of
them extending out into the streets... this is probably one of the major
reasons it was so civil.  The other was that the outage did not occur
while it was already dark, and the third likely due to the previous "Get
the fuck out of NYC" when the WTC turned to dust.
At work we are still experiencing outages as our ISP is down because their
ISP is down.  Even more fun, our phone system goes through the ISP, so that's down too.  This is what you get when you pay the lowest price you
can.  I expect this is the same reason this outtage occured in the first
place.  Everyone cutting corners, etc.  (See my previous rant.)  My fault
for working for a small .com rather than a big company, but no one is
hiring sysadmins these days unless they're wet behind the ears and are
willing to take $40K, or they're outsourcing to the likes of EDS.
I've got lots of fun exposure to EDS outsourcing quality of service -
those guys are total morons.  Asked them to reboot one machine, and got
back 30 emails saying "not my dept."  Took about 4-5 hours to get a
machine rebooted when it should have taken less than 5 mins.  On another
occasion they couldn't figure out how to get their internal and external
DNS to point to the same host...  and they actually have an entire DNS
dept! To quote Homer, D'Oh!
Hopefully IBM's outsourcing gig is better.  To anyone thinking they can
outsource IT and/or systems admins,  I wish you the best.  You'll need
it.  In the end, you get what you pay for.  Every fucking time.  No
exceptions.  Sure, Raj is cheaper than me.  But that's the level of
service you should expect too, 'cause you'll get it!
I won't comment on the previous NYC outage/riots as I wasn't in NYC at the

This is wonderful moronic lawyer behavior.  Perhaps if you work at SCO,
you have to eat out of lead bowls and drink hot coffee from unglazed lead
coffee mugs?  Either that or this is some weird, but less potential
version of Steve Job's reality distortion field gone bad - the way milk

Yes, Federal law allows you the EXTRA right to make one backup copy as per
fair use.  However, the GPL is not a copyright, it's a license agreement that gives
the user extra rights, by virtue of the author's good will.  So the author
maintains his copyright, but allows the user to do the copying and
distributing - the end user is almost acting as the copyright holder's
agent.  If the court rules that the GPL is invalid (i.e. clueless jury or judge)
then all shrink wrap licenses are null and void also, and I don't think
Billy Gates would like that very much, so in an odd turn of events, he'll
be on the side of GPL come time for appeals!  Wouldn't that be sweet
Indeed.  Like the article says: D'oh!   No wonder SCO's SCummy executives
dumped their stock....
I would have expected them to claim that the Caldera employee who let
Unix(tm) source out the door did so illegally, and therefore the GPL can't
apply to that source, and that they still own rights to it, but it's
doubtful they could prove such a thing.
I believe the right and proper course of action is to give SCO a taste of
their own shit, and have every linux user and every linux company file an
INDIVIDUAL court case against SCO and NOT turn it into a class action suit
(if it were possible).
That would stretch SCO's lawyers very think to the point where they
couldn't show up in court to defend themselves, and thus automatically
loose.  *
* But(!) I don't play a lawyer on TV, and I'm a very bad actor, so consult
a real lawyer, or a real actor, blah, blah, blah.
I think Stan Kelly-Bootle's Devil's DP Dictonary needs the word Darl added
to it, with the definition of: litigious asshole, who ironically couldn't
find his own asshole if it were on his forehead and he looked straight on
into a mirror during broad daylight.
But, that would be demeaning to assholes.

@_subject: Re: Secure IDE? 
So build an individual key for each cluster by some function that uses the
original key.  Same idea as using IV's, but with a few twists.  IMHO,
using CBC's for disk encryption sucks because you'll need to read previous
sectors, and that's slower...
I say cluster, not sector, as it's usually faster to work in 128k chunks
than in 512 byte chunks when reading/writing to disk.  YMMV, etc.
Here's the idea:
For example, use a very large random key preferably from a good
hrng... say a few megs in size... maybe something that would fit on a
flash fob... say 16-128mb.  Let's call this K.  (This can also be one of
those business card CD's, etc...)
Protect the actual key by encrypting it with a has from the user's
passphrase to prevent someone from grabbing the fob and just using it of
course.  Call this E(k).  Make sure that the user has backup copies of
this fob.
Perhaps this can be an N of M split for the backup, so the user will need
several of the backup fob's to generate the key...  This way an attack
that has temporary physical access won't be able to simply steal a backup
At boot up/mount time, you'll need both the flash fob and the key to
unlock it.
You can even put some sort of unique disk id on the physical disk and use
this as part of the key for that disk.  Call this D.  D might depend
on the physical parameters of the disk and the manufacturer - but this is probably not such a great idea -- if the disk fails, you can't just restore it's image over another for example...  So more random numbers are a good way to go.  D can be stored on the disk itself (in encrypted
form of course - say by a hash of the passphrase or something else.)
This way, you can securely encrypt multiple disks with the same
You can now build some function that grabs N bits from K based on the
value of D and the cluster number, where N is the size of the key for your
cypher.  This will serve instead of the IV.  You should also test this key
to see if it is a weak key for the particular cypher - and if so, switch
to an alternate function, etc.
In the case of cyphers such as blowfish where the cypher is relatively
fast, but the setup time is too slow to have as many keys as clusters,
you'll need to limit the above function so that it can only produce a
manageable number of keys (say 256, 1024, or whatever you think is
manageable) - that way you can intialize each decode key ahead of time and
keep them in non-swapable RAM.  You'll need to figure out what a good
balance is so you don't wind up exhausting RAM, and at the same time, have
enough keys available to give you protection.
Optionally, if you have access to the file system (i.e. you're running an
open source OS and have access to the file system structures), you might
want to add something that fills in deleted blocks with random garbage to
throw off attackers.  No need to encrypt them, but you'll need to make
sure that there's nothing statistically distinguishing them from encrypted
blocks.  This can help you speed things up if you have access to a
moderately fast rng.
Another thing to consider from the "I have OS source code" level is to
perhaps optionally also compress files stored to the disk, and use a file
system that can handle gappy files.  The worse thing you could do is to
actually store a long string of clusters of 00's in the plaintext... (Then
again, if your crypto cypher is good, this is much less of an issue.)
Another thing to worry about is how to not have known plaintext on the
encrypted disk - the majority of binaries for example are going to be well
known and can act as this plaintext for the attacker.  Compression
somewhat takes care of this.  Compiling your own software with
slightly different optimizations or compiler versions rather than using
the distributed binaries of your OS is a good thing.  i.e. use Linux from
Scratch as a distro and tweak your compiler to use different optimizations
or target processors than usual.
Having access to the OS adds another advantage in that you can reserve
access to the fob (or key cd) just for the disk encryption system and
prevent rogue software from just stealing the key.  (Assuming of course
that your kernel is secured, and can limit non-kernel access to devices,
etc, etc, etc.) A lot of this can be done in hardware if you have enough $$$ to build it
on a separate embedded computer -- I constantly see these advertised in
the usual Linux mags for several hundred dollars and they contain flash,
ethernet, serial ports, etc...  Some even have IDE ports... This would be
a perfect thing to sit between your disks and your main computer.  It
could add another layer of complexity for the attacker to have to deal
with...  In this case, the main computer wouldn't even have access to the
key fob at all.  This embedded computer can possibly do other things for
you, such as act as a hardware RAID controller - thus freeing up the host
machine from that task, etc, and even better, the host machine wouldn't
store any keys on it whatsoever.  You could also make the embedded machine
into a firewall with an application level http/smtp filter as well.
It would just access the embedded machine as if it were an IDE or SCSI
device without any way to attack it.  This way you could even run
Windblows on it (somewhat) securely.  If you added a firewall to the
embedded machine, it could also prevent trojans from sending back
information to their owners, installing spyware, whatever...
You can even go as far as using one of those happy gamer clear plastic
cases (very bad because of RF emissions, but it will let you see the
insides of your computer making it harder for someone to add their own
hardware to it.)
Now backups are going to be the next main thing to worry about.  Letting
the user make backups of plaintext data is a horrible idea.  It's better
to provide a backup facility ahead of time that would take chunks of the
disk 650MB/800MB/4.5GB (or tape sized) at a time so they can be burned to
CD.  You may optionally wish to not write the empty random clusters - but
that would aid an attacker in that they wouldn't have to deal with
figuring out what the ununsed sectors were as per the previous paragraph.
BTW: If you implement this idea commercially, all I ask in return is that
you give me a copy of the software/hardware -- or license it under the
GPL, or FreeBSD license. :)

disk 650MB/800MB/4.5GB (or tape sized) at a time so they can be burned to
CD.  You may optionally wish to not write the empty random clusters - but
that would aid an attacker in that they wouldn't have to deal with
figuring out what the ununsed sectors were as per the previous paragraph.
BTW: If you implement this idea commercially, all I ask in return is that
you give me a copy of the software/hardware -- or license it under the
GPL, or FreeBSD license. :)

These are the terms to which Bob has agreed to.  It clearly states that
AOL may if it chooses to remove access to content it deems harmful for
whatever reason.  It does not list what those reasons are, therefore, they
are at its discretion - NOT AT YOURS.
There is no need for any law to change this.  Bob and AOL both voluntarily
agreed to these terms.  End of story.
Stop right there.  AOL's contract is with Bob. NOT WITH you, ALICE.  You
have no claims to make.  You have no contract with AOL, it is under no
obligation whatsoever to deal with you.  If you don't like that, sign up
with AOL, agree to their terms, and file a complaint - if those rules will
allow you to do so.  Otherwise, you have no way to interfere with the
agreement between Bob and AOL.
No.  There is no such legal entity as "The Internet."  AOL, like all other
ISP's (I'm stretching the term here) has contractual agreements with other
ISP's from which it obtains service.  Depending on what those rules allow,
AOL may or may not be playing by the rules.  That's up to whomever feeds
AOL to decide, not you.  You are not AOL's ISP.  You have no contract with
AOL on that level either.
AOL is not actively causing any denial of service to anyone other than
those who agreed to be subject to AOL's jurisdiction - by contract.  Says
so in their terms that they reserve the right to do this.
That is not upto you to decide.  That is upto Bob.  Since you haven't
entered any business agreement with AOL, you cannot make such claims
against them.
I am?  So, then you understand that you have no claims whatsoever against
AOL since you aren't using their service, nor have any contract whatsoever
with them?  Then why all the BS?
Of course, because they're providing you with water service.  Therefore,
you have agreed to those implict or explicit terms.  You have a contract
with the city, or the water company.  Either because that's what the laws
of the city state, or because you've signed a contract with the water
company agreeing to their terms.  Just like Bob signed a contract with
AOL.  So what's your beef???
Where's the crime again?
Hey, you're the one that claimed that the needs of humans outweigh those
of a corporation.  So by that logic, not that I agree with it, should you
need a stapler, you should be able to take one from AOL.  Of course it's
assinine.  That's what I'm trying to show you.  That your arguement is
full of shit.
The 1st ammended prevents >CONGRESS< from limiting the freedom of
speech. More precisely from creating laws that do so.  It does not limit
private or public companies from doing so.  The 1st has nothing to do with
this.  You're clueless.
And you have no contract with either AOL or that friend.  Like I said, you
have no right to interfere in AOL's business.  If you can convince their
subscribers that AOL sucks, and they chose to cancel their service, that's
fine, that's wonderful - though if AOL finds out, they may sue you for
loss of business.
Yes, you did.  As soon as you hit the send button in your mailer and had a
to be sent to AOL's mail servers, which - as you already expected since
you knew, caused them to be deleted.
Further, I would urge you read your ISP's terms of service.  There's no
place in there that they guarantee delivery of email to an end user of
another ISP.  Because they can't.  So you have no such expectation.
I'm done with this, you're too clueless to continue.  Come back when you
get some brains.

What the fuck do you mean unfortunately?
Why is it forbidden by law?  Bob signed a contract with Mallory waiving
certain rights in exchange for the service provided by Mallory. Mallory
provided full disclosure of it's rights to Bob along with Bob's
responsabilities, etc.  Bob chose to accept those terms, how is this
illegal again?
If the service Mallory provides Bob is inadequate, that's between Mallory
and Bob, not between Alice and Bob.  Alice and Mallory have no contract
what-so-ever.  It's upto you, Alice, to convince Bob of this fact.  If you
can't, that's Bob's choice, not yours.  And you have no business to
interfere between Bob and Mallory.
Wrong.  Bob agreed to those terms of service, it's not a denial of
service, it's part of Bob's agreement with Mallory.
No.  Either you have agreed to live in said house by purchasing it, and
have therefore become a citizen of said city, and by such actions agreed
to abide by it's laws, or pre-existing laws allowed the city to run such
water services through your propery.  This too is by contract.
Where, Ms. Alice, is your contract with Mallory again?
No, it does not.  Please take this to
alt.dumb.law.questions.asked.by.clueless.morons.  This has nothing to do
with cypherpunks.
So, in that case if you need a red stapler, you should be able to break
into AOL's offices and steal one?????  Since fucking when?
That's the choice of your friends and family, not yours.  Take it up with
them, not AOL.
This is true - utpto the point where you place said packets on the
internet.  From that point on, while you may retain copyright (even that
is questionable), you have explicity caused an automated action that takes
said packets and puts them into the machine that is the internet, for it
to do what it does.  If some of the members of that machine do things
differently than you expect, it sucks to be you, but that's your problem,
not theirs.  You decided to place those packets on that network, not the
members of that network.
If you put a book you wrote into a shredder, well, who are you going to
sue?  The shredder company? Or yourself?
No, dumbass, you placed those packets on said network repeatedly after you
have discovered that they will be dropped in the bit bucket, that's too
bad for you.  You've vandalized your own packets.
And that is their right, as contractually agreed to by their customers -
your friends and family members included.  You have no stake in this, nor
any relationship with AOL.
No, you abused your own property knowing full well it would be dropped
into the bit bucket right after the 1st time you tried it.  And since
you've got no contractual agreement with AOL, you have no expected
reasonable expectation that AOL would forward your packets to your f&f,
especially if AOL deems your packets to be harmful to it's network for
whatever reason.
Your idiocy is showing.

As for our city's reptile of a Mayor he claimed power would be back on in
queens by 11pm.  It wasn't on until 6am Friday.  On Friday night there

Certainly, I'd expect whatever FUD explanation to be most profitable to

Of course CON-Ed would say "Blame Canada."  I expect nothing less.
Did anyone catch the Shrubbya interview? I think it was on CNNFN or MSNBC
or one of those neonews channels...  The one where he was busy sweating in
the sun's heat in his blue Armani dress shirt while, his face browned from
the sun, playing golf.  The one where he regurgitated what he had been
spoon fed by his PR guys?  At one instant he shrugged his shoulders as he
said it's an old grid, and it will need to be fixed, and then he went back
to golfing.  Showing how much he cares about the plight of the east coast.
More than likely I suspect the truth is that the grid is indeed outdated
and something simply couldn't handle the load.  Whenever politicians, and
bureaucrats are involved, the outcome is the same:
Chief Executive Asshole: "Why should we spend $X million to fix it?  It's
still running?"
Techie: "Because it's running at 95% capacity, and any small spike will
cause a big problem."
CEA: "But it's been fine for the last 20 years, I'd rather keep the cash
and give myself a bonus, and then lay off extraneous employees.  We can
outsource them to India."
Techie: "It's outdated, it will collapse."
CEA: "So what? When it does, if it does, we'll hit Uncle Sam for more
money, meanwhile I have another yacht to purchase.  In any case, it won't
likely collapse while I'm still here, and I'll retire soon enough, not my
problem... and don't let the door hit your ass on your way out.  I don't
want ass prints on my brand new gold plated door."

Me, I'm "afraid" of the oil companies, they're constantly raising the
price of gas, so I'm going to call them "price gouging terrorists."  I'd
happily switch to another brand, but it seems all them are raising their
prices equally.
Oh, and the milk terrorists are at it again, adding another $1 to the
price of a gallon of milk.
And those annoying terrorists that call us during dinner at at it again,
the telemarketers... well, actually, I've gotten less and less of these
calls recently, but why spoil a good rant (wink, wink) :)
Oh, yeah, and those CON-Ed guys are terrorists too, why they threated to
raise their prices, or they'll let us experience more black outs (well
they didn't, but Bush said so - so he's a terrorist too!)
Oh, yeah, and Mayor Bloomberg's a terrorist from the point of view of
smokers, and cell phone users who happen to drive.  And so is the
governor... fuck why isn't Arnold running for Governor of NYC???  Wait, he
was, The Terminator - so that means he's a SkyNet Cell Member, and
therefore, a terrorist too!
And, let's not forget the MTA who recently raised their prices by 30%
terrorized all New Yorkers, too...
And wait, wait!  The fucknuts that did the world trade center were
terrorists, and they wore underwear and socks!  So anyone who wears
underwear or socks is a terrorist!!!  Arrest'em all!
Fuck it, everyone's a terrorist.  Send'em all to GITMO....  :^)

In that case, I would suspect the ISP itself would have incoming/outgoing
feeds from other ISP's.  If that single moral objector ISP refuses to
allow carnivores, the other, not quite as moral ISP's might be persuaded
to allow it, in which case the fedZ get what they want, just one
traceroute hop further up the chain.  Perhaps not all of them, but perhaps
enough of them...  Duh!
That's the thing about the internet - your packets must travel through
other ISP's (unless you're communicating with other nodes hosted by that
single ISP which is unlikely).  From the fedZ point of view, you need not
tap each and every single ISP.  You can tap upstream, and still get the
data without tipping off the target, or his moral objector friends at her
At some point every ISP goes through MCI, Sprint, and AT&T, and don't
forget the local (phone company) loops.
Assuming that such a moral objector ISP would exist, it would be foolish
to assume that it would provide much of a measure of protection against
tapping cleartext transmissions.  Hence, encryption is important.  Want
privacy and security?  It's up to you to provide it: encrypt.

Indeed.  Despite all of Tim's rage, we're still just rats in a cage, and
despite Tim's urging of necklacing ISP owners, or other foam at the mouth
arm-chair solutions, Occam's razor still supplies the better, and cleaner
If your MTA has it, turn on the START TLS option.  If it doesn't, either
compile it in, or get a new MTA for your server.  Also add GPG/PGP, and
hard drive encryption, to both your client and the server.
(Since the discussion is about ISP's, we can assume that you own the
server either hosted by or fed by your ISP - if you don't - i.e. you're on
a dial-up PPP, you're at the ISP's mercy anyway, and the ISP can
read/forge your mail unless you PGP every piece of email.)
Don't have secure IMAP/POP capabilities?  Use ssh as a secure tunnel to
transport IMAP/POP/SMTP from the client into the server.  Even when your
client lives on the same network segment as the server.  If you don't
realize why this is useful, get clued in as quickly as you can.
Of course, as usual, this discussion will next focus on physical security
(hint for the above paragraph for those in need of a clue), then detecting
black bag operations, with the usual "Read the Fucking Archives" coming
from the usual source(s).
And you know what?  This indeed has already been dealt with, so yes, by
all means, "Read the fucking archives" does apply.  So go and read the
fucking archives - all of you.  That's your homework.  Do it!  There will
be a quiz tomorrow!  Be sure to bring your  pencils!  :)

Look, the answers are excruciatingly simple:  1. your email should not execute.
2. your web browser should not be able to run script that can access
anything other than contect that came from that server - or in the least
that domain -- especially not your hard drive.  Things like ActiveX are a
security nightmare.
3. your machine should not serve any services to the outside world that
it doesn't need to.
It doesn't matter what OS you run, the above are all still true.  Do that,
the 90% of insecurity goes away.  Add buffer overflow protections, and
another 5% goes away.  Add parameter checking to libraries, good security
permissions on file systems and other objects, and things like per process
capabilities limitations, and another 4% goes away.
If you run a network of unhardened Macs, Linux boxes, FreeBSD or even
OpenBSD boxes, you may as well hang up a sign that says "break in please."
All of this has been previously dealt with elsewhere, and it isn't that
hard to grok.  The only reason to cricize the redmond beast that should
not be is points 1-3.  The paragraph following it hasn't been implemented
anywhere that's widely in use.  Things like SE Linux and OBSD have attempted some of them and succeeded,
but they're not as widely used as they should be.
Worrying about what percentage of machines are hetro vs homogenous is a
waste of time.  Do you run Linux or MacOS X?  Did you bother to upgrade
OpenSSH last week?  No?  Is ssh open for anyone on the internet to access?  Well then, you're fucked, and you're not even running Windows!
If someone breaks into a windows 95 machine on your network whose owner
has access to files vital to your company's existance, the potential to
break into the server is already there.
Don't just harden SOME machines and your firewall, harden them all.  A
simple activeX component off some rogue web page is enough to take over a
lame little win9x machine. Ever seen WebX? - it's like PCAnywhere, or VNC or TimbukTu, only it works
over the web.  A user just goes to a web page, and a user at the other end
can take over their machine because IE allows such software to run!  Ok, at least WebX is a commercial product designed to provide tech
support, and asks if it's ok to allow it, but if it's technically possible
to do it for legitimate reasons, it's technically feasable to do it for
rogue reasons too.
Worms aren't the only problems out there.

was, but I'm assuming it did quite well...
The difference between that and this, is that if you put the floppy on
your fridge door with a magnet, you could always get your backup (or ask
your friend for her copy.)  With this, even if you have a legally
purchased copy, one or two scratches and it's literraly "Game Over Man!"   + ^ + :25Kliters anthrax, 38K liters botulinum toxin, 500 tons of   /|\

@_subject: Re: Software protection scheme may boost new game sales 
Ok, so I finally bothered to read said article.  I assumed that they had
something interesting that made it look to the error correction code like
a scratch, etc... They don't.  No such weakness exists in error correction
used on CD's.
Their protection is no more than putting bad error correcting codes on
sectors, and when a CD copier is used, the "error" correction is
corrected, but the software can detect that this is a copy.  No different
than current game protection (no different than the commodore 64 days
The "new new thing" aspect of it is that the copied game continues to run,
making the guy doing the backup think he's got a good copy, but it slowly
degrades itself.  Degrade, but not in the sense of CD rot or scratches.
So for a few hours(?), it's playable, but then it starts to no longer
respond to user commands properly, and so it becomes a marketing tool.  The luser will think it's worth buying their own copy after getting
addicted to the game.
So the rub, is that copies are allowed to be made, but unless cracked, the
copies are nothing more than time limited demos.
The only way that this could work is if they put up some sort of splash
screen at some point to let the luser know that the program isn't buggy,
but that the copy protection noticed it's a backup.  After all, if you get
a copy of a game from a friend, and it crashes on you all the time, would
you think it's because the copy is bad, or because the software is as
buggy as a Microsoft product?
As usual, the real loser is the original purchaser, because if he
scratches his CD, he's out $50-$70 or whatever games cost today, and he
can't make backups.

Yawn...  This is no different than any of the copy protection schemes
employed in the 1980's on then popular home computers such as the
commodore 64.  Hindsight is 20/20 and recalls, all of these were broken within weeks if
not months.  "Nibbler" copiers and other programs were quickly built that
allowed the breaking of all of these systems.  All sorts of "error"
sectors, duplicate tracks, half tracks, extra tracks, extra sectors,
non-standard sized sectors, tracks written at different speeds, erroneous
checksums, hidden data, and other sorts of weird bits were employed.  All
were broken.  None survived the ages.
In the end, the companies that employed copy protection only managed to
piss off customers who lost their only copy of the software, and created a
market for the copiers and crackers.  The crackers won, the software
companies lost.  Few of the companies of that era are still in business today.  CEO's,
Vulture Capitalists, and others who have an interest in such schemes would
do well to invest some time in learning about that time, and the results,
for their investments, and dollars will go the same way... the way of the
brontosaurus, the trilobite, and the dodo.
Let them try, if they wish to burn their money.  As far as I'm concerned,
I'll vote with my wallet as usual and only run open source, free software.  If the moronic kids at whom these titles are aimed have the $50-$70 per
title to waste on self destructing, flavor of the month games, they are
certainly free to spend that money to their heart's desire.
Not a dime from my wallet will wind up in their pockets - except perhaps
indirectly:  the next time I buy my next burger, "no, I don't want fries
with that, no, I don't want to supersize it," my $5 eventually makes a
small contribution to the salary of the burger flipper, which in turn is
applied to the purchase of said game.  :)
I've not read the said article just yet, but from that direct quote "as

degrade, because their "code looks like scratches..."  Riiiiggghtt.....
If you can make one copy, you can make many, and you can certainly store
the ISO in compressed form on a normal CD to make more copies
later.   CDR's are what? $0.20@ these days?
Hell, you can even get one of those virtual CDROM programs to mount the
CD's as if they were CD's, and store the ISO on a hard drive, or DVD-R
instead. Hard drives are already in the 250-500GB range these days.  So
their scheme is already flawed and doomed from the start.

The push to do that should be aimed at the MTA authors and package
organizers.  If you can get it turned on by default, you're half way
there.  Last time I tried to fuck with this on qmail, I had to patch qmail
to support it.  Not something I'd like to do again - hopefully it's
changed a bit.  From 1st hand experience - it is indeed a pain in the ass.
But if you can get the big projects to turn it on by default for all/most
of the MTA's, then you can push the bigger fish to do so as well.  I'd
start with OpenBSD - they're likely to be friendlier to the idea.  Then
you can push FreeBSD, NetBSD, RedHat Linux, Mandrake, and so on...  Then
the MTA authors, then Solaris (which seems to be bent on copying whatever
Linux does) and so on....
Strangely enough, I recall that of all the entitites, out there MSFT had
implemented some sort of secure SMTP in somne version of IIS.. like
4.0...  Not sure about Exchange and its ilk...

The biggest hurdle and the thing that will have the most effect is to have
every MTA out there turn on Start TLS.  It won't provide a big enhancement
in terms of security at the ISP level, but it will blind the global
content search engines everywhere.  Except, of course, at those ISP's
already infected by carnivore boxes - which at least aren't allowed by law
to capture all traffic, but I wouldn't put money that they'd follow it.
So the first course of action is to convince MTA authors everywhere to
enable and turn this on.  Later, they could drop support for non-TLS
traffic.  It could also help against spamming somehow, as it will cost the
spammer a few more CPU cycles. (But this will be a very weak deterrent
against spam.)
The next hurdle will be to get Microsoft Outlook to ship with PGP - it'll
be a very very cold day in hell for that to happen.  :)  So, we'll keep
dreaming and wishing.  Certainly, if it does, only fools will trust it as

No doubt such a card will automatically be linked to a Microsoft Passport account, Microsoft Wallet, etc. to make sure that the violation of your privacy can continue  unhindered.
No doubt, the 2nd step will be to either add an RFID chip inside it plus a reader on the PC... Or setting the next Microsoft PC spec to include a barcode/RFID reader on the PC.  (Or perhaps this is already in the spec, just not advertised?)
Then you'll need to login with the card, and activating Windows XP, etc. will require the card; all Office documents will be signed/stamped with a GID that matches said card, etc...  Hell, it might as well be your SSN... After all, continuing abuse of the social security numbers meets all Microsoft criteria for such a thing: it's a sensitive number, that when handled in an unsecure way (Microsoft's modus operandi, of course) it's guaranteed to open you up to ID, financial, and privacy theft...
That said, "Backdoor*" Billy Gee is about two and half years late to share the feed through at the scummy emperor of privacy invasion:
You see, both Larry "I wear a kimono" Ellison, and Scooter (formerly known as the "The Dot in dot com" CEO) both had immediate wet dreams of a national ID card right after 9.11.2001.  Of course, the former wanted it to involve Oracle, the latter wanted it to be on a Java smartcard...  uh huh...
Yes, we all know great government issued ID's worked to prevent the disposable terrorists of 9.11.  I'm sure that the Microsoft ID will work even better in making us just even more "secure."
* "Secure" is a newspeak marketing feechure checklist item which is to be translated the same way as the word love in Ministry of Love, the word peace in the Ministry of Peace, the word truth in the Ministry of Truth.
* Backdoor in this case refers not to Billy's preference of human interaction, but rather to the 'More "Secure" than before' feature of Windows XP which was made famous by various trojans, worms, and other self-replicating bits of code.

Coventry.  Story goes Churchill had info from Bletchley Enigma intercepts that Coventry was next to be bombed, but if he evacuated it, the Germans would have suspected that Enigma was cracked.  I've also heard references that this was an urban legend, not sure.
However, they did sink quite a lot of subs based on triangulation + Enigma decrypts by fortuitously sending an airplane in the area they knew the subs would be before hunting them down - as cover to say that the subs were spotted...  This way they could sink the subs and still let the Germans think that Enigma was safe.

For example, one way to piss them off is to attempt to sing when you have zero singing skills, and do it for hours on end, purposely off key, abusing whatever instrument is available...  Or playing something very annoying/disturbing over and over again...
Large doses of Aphex Twin or Beavis and Butthead, dogs barking, etc.  Ditto on unimportant phone and cell conversations, especially while driving in your car, or for even more phone fun, call yourself from the cell phone and let the minutes add up and playing some of the above, or better yet, put the cell phone and phone handset together and let the sweet digital feedback built up.  Whatever you're paying in cellphone minutes is far less than what they're wasting on surveillance, that's for sure.
Or, instead of having fun with them, you go about your business pretending to be on the side of those bugging you, then do whatever it is you need to do anyway and surprise them at the last moment.  This involves typing one memo on your desk computer in the office, and delivering a totally different - perhaps handwritten at the last moment before it's actually needed, then make lots of public noise loudly about being hampered, etc.

Interesting virus - anyone know what this one is called and what it's payload does?  Haven't seen this one before today...
It attaches a zip file with a password containing an executable.  (No worries, I've not run it, and only extracted it on a SPARC machine, so it can't use buffer overflows designed for intel in unzip -- if any exist.)
I've seen several of these from various cypherpunk nodes, and initially thought someone was attacking cypherpunks nodes again...
So what it is likely grabbing the domian name and capitalizing the first letter and inserting "The" and "team." around it to make it look like it's from the ISP...  It's also using various random reasons (mailbox is full, spamming, account about to expire, account abuse, can't go out with you tonight, have to wash hamster's hair, etc.)
Interesting that a virus would use an encrypted ZIP file.  Of course it does a dumb thing in terms of "security purposes" of sending the password with the attachment.  Certainly that isn't something a security wise person would do, *BUT* the true purpose of this ploy is likely an attempt for it to get past virus scanners which demime/unzip files through multiple layers, and would be able to detect the attachment is malware.
So this thing is probably carrying code to ZIP+encrypt files as well as MIME and possibly it's own SMTP client...  Pretty amazing for a 12K binary...  Well, not really. :)  I guess I'm used to seeing bloatware like Office 2000 - oh, yeah, forgot, MSFT products are virii..  :-D
Many, many, years ago, I recall there were polymorphic virii which encrypted their main body, but used various methods to build the extractor such that you (as an antivirus writer) couldn't easily get signatures from the extractor portion.  I believe they used permutations of opcodes which did the same thing under x86, but enough random combinations to prevent getting a useful virus signature.
It probably won't be long before we'll start seeing those again in modern Certainly email virus scanners shouldn't allow .EXE - even if inside of .ZIP archives anyway, but it's still interesting to see how the evil virus writers find new ways to push their crud on the  "If it's got dancing nude hippos, I'll click on it gladly, safety be damned" sheeple.  Now it's just exploiting the "I'll obey any instruction from any so called authority if you throw in the magic word 'reasons of security' in it."
What's really funny to me personally is that at my last job we were asked to send self decrypting PGP EXE's that contained the actual data to clients who didn't have PGP, and wouldn't know it from a hole in a wall.  We'd then tell them the (usually lame) password over the phone.  If any of those clients receive one of these, I can absolutely guarantee that they'll open it and spread this evil crap.

@_subject: Re: Saving Opportunistic Encryption 
I absolutely agree.  While it's possible to do things like MIM attacks if you don't know who the other guy is, look at how successful SSH is over any other kind of solution.  Its biggest competitor at the time it was introduced was kerberized telnet/ftp.  How many networks do you know that use Kerberos instead of ssh these days?
Look at how many folks use PGP - those who really know it and want it, or those who know enough about it and have some easily automated implementation that plugs in to their mail client. (i.e. commercial pgp with Eudora/Outlook plug in.  As an aside, I'm still pissed off that the Mozilla mail client doesn't support PGP/GPG in addition to S/MIME or whatever the hell..)
Adding another infrastructure requirement that requires ISP layer changes will exponentially raise resistance to its adoption.  While I do run my own server for mail/web, 99.9% of the internet luser population doesn't - and even so, I chose not to run my own DNS server.  (Allowing register.com to do so makes it safer for me: it's one less service that might be compromised due to possible bugs.)
Making it optional to add that infrastructure layer - whether it's via DNS, LDAP, signed public keys, web o' trust / pgp keyserver, finger, or even something entirely new, is probably the safer way to go, BUT don't require it.
There do exist transparent web caching proxies out there (usually advertised as web accelerators.)  I ran across such a few months ago when our satellite office couldn't connect to one of our servers.  We were using private dns virtual host names to access management web pages on our servers.  However the proxy intercepted those requests, and tried to resolve DNS, but obviously couldn't, so everyone in the office got a DNS error.  It took some pretty strong words to get the ISP to even admit that they were using such a beast, much less disable it just for us.
It's certainly possible to create a proxy to do MitM interception that would foil even SSH.  This wouldn't work so well against mobile devices which might fortuitously use a different route, but would work very well one hop above the server if that's the only pipe the server has.
There are ways to protect against this such as publishing a line for the known-hosts entry by other means, but no one does this (yet?)  (i.e: sneakernet, finger, web page, pgp signed/encrypted email, over the telephone, etc.)   (Another useful thing is to use public keys for SSH instead of passwords: this way the attacker won't be able to reuse your password - but you're still compromised the second you login.)
There are some rare cases where you absolutely want to know who you are talking to.  For example an https server that allows control of financial data.  Even in that case the server doesn't fully know who the client is, and doesn't need to (in order to establish the secure link) -- until a login (or CC info) is presented.  In the case of using OE to talk to a server, the client already has some idea of the server's identity, and the server will eventually have some idea of who the client is.
As an aside: Just doing the above to encapsulate emails won't help at all against spamming: the spammers will just randomly generate throw away public keys, etc.  They've already written trojan spammers with their own SMTP servers built in, it's only a few more (thousand?) lines of code to incrementally bypass that layer as well.
I've already seen a few years ago spam sites that return "yahoo.com" and "msn.com" in reverse DNS, but doing traceroutes reveals that they're actually in Korea or China, etc.  So you can't fully rely on (spoofable) DNS info anyway.
If any of you remember the recent virii attacks where the attachment is a password protected zip file with the password in the body of the email, guess what: the evil ones kicked it up a notch once more.
Just yesterday, I saw a new form of this on cpunx: instead of a ZIP attachment, the new malware uses a RAR archive, and instead of the password being in clear text, it's inside an a randomly named attached .GIF file! They've not obscured it, so it's possible to add OCR to the anti-virus code, but it's now it's that much harder for the anti-virus to block.
Just as the virus authors evolve their code to adapt their offenses to the defenses of virus scanners, so will the spammers evolve their code to bypass spam filters, and we've already seen that spammers use virii/worms to spread their code...
Distributed computing is already here.  Shame that it's biggest use is currently for evil.  Ugh! :(

I agree with everything you've said in your post, including >PRIVATE< DRM measures, but, I disagree that Microsoft should be admired.
I've seen far too much evil emminated from Redmond:
* from outright theft of smaller companies' IP (i.e. Stacker),
* dumping ("We'll help you migrate from Netware to NT 3.51 for free"),
* FUD (GNU is communism and Anti-American),
* evil contracts (if you sell blank machines without Windows, you have to pay $X more for our software)
* stealth funding of SCO's lawsuit against IBM and linux end users,
* to lots of needless security holes - some even by design, (i.e. security is a checkbox as a marketing feature, or an afterthought: i.e. this chant: "Active X! Active X! Format Hard drive? Just say 'YES!'")
For the final one, I used to work at Earthweb, which ran Gamelan (pronounced gah-meh-lohn, not game LAN), a Java repository.  At one point, EW decided to start an Active X repository.  Some guy wrote an Active X browser component that shut off your machine if you clicked yes.  The component did exactly what it said it did, but it was a good example that it could have done something else.  Hence the "Active X! Active X! Format Hard Drive? Just say YES!" chant.
Let me tell you, Microsoft tried very, very hard to get us to remove that bit of code from the repository.  We didn't, because it did exactly what it claimed to do.
More financial damage has been done to the planet by Microsoft than good. Far too many sysadmin/developer hours were lost because of Microsoft.  You can certainly count the hours in lost human lives...  Hell, just add up the cost of each virus/trojan/worm outbreak which targets Outlook, Office, and Internet Exploiter.
Now don't get me wrong.  I'm not some knee-jerk Linux Good, Windows bad clueless geek wannabee.  I started out as a Novell Netware sysadmin. (Well, I started out as a coder, but fell into sysadming over time.)
When NT starting taking over, I picked it up and thought it was cool.  It's design was certainly revolutionary, and the NTFS was one of the best designed file systems I've seen, even to this day.  NT's borrow a driver from the server printing was beautiful.  User management via domains? Sweet!  Ok, not too much better than NIS, but hey, very nice. Active Directory?  Much, much mo'e better.  DHCP?  Great wonderful idea.  Gateway for Netware Services and Migration from Netware?  A bit scummy, but hey it's free with the server, might as well use it*.  File and Printer sharing for Macintosh?  Cool! - well, except for that one bug with the dancing icons back a few years ago...
(* Gateway Service for Netware allowed a scummy sysadmin to bypass the license limitation of Netware servers.  A single "user" from the NT server would login to the Netware server and proxy hundreds if not thousands of user requests.  You suffered in performance, but one of it's uses was to bypass licensing.  If you read NT's license it says something along the lines that you can't use another proxy this way against an NT server.)
Registry?  Hey, wonderful idea.  No, really.  Storing all your machine's settings in a single place and having a single editor (ok two of them) to control them was beautiful.  Just make sure you (can and do) back it up.
No, I'm not being sarcastic, if you know how the registry works, how to back it up, how to restore it, and how to repair it, it's a great thing - much better than lots of .ini, .rc or .conf files everyfuckingwherethankyouverymuch.  Ok, in unixen everything lives in /etc.   But which /etc?  /etc? /usr/local/etc? /usr/local/samba/etc? and the dot files in home directories?  ouch!  (A regular thing that I do is to backup all of /etc /usr/local/etc just to make sure I can restore them.  With Windows, you just run rdisk /s- and copy %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\repair.)
At the last job, we had a dead Exchange 5.5 on NT 4.0 server.  Its hardware died.  I worked for a shitty little dot com.  The guy admining it couldn't restore it.  We didn't have another motherboard that mached the drivers on that box, so we couldn't just move the hard drive over.  Know what I did? I merged the hardware related registry files from the sacrificial machine on the OS of the dead one to get it to boot, then hand reinstalled the network driver and a few other minor things like the video driver.  It's not so hard if you know what you're doing, and a registry isn't a bad thing.
All of the above features more or less beat the shit out of all flavors of unix when NT 3.5x/4.0 came out.  By the time XP was on, Linux and FreeBSD had caught up and then some.  Solaris at this point was trying to get Linux compatibility with lxrun, SGI was already gonzo from the art market with Mac taking over.
NT was beautiful - in theory, and on paper.  Because a lot of it was VMS on Remote management tools weren't too horrible.  Ok, you couldn't ssh into a box, and the command line tools sucked - even after the resource kit, but MMC worked nicely and let you mostly manage boxes remotely if you knew what you were doing.  Sure, you couldn't easily launch a program on a remote server, but you could run the scheduler remotely and tell it to run something two minutes from now.
But, oh man, the bugs were murder.  So were the patches. Things like invisible, unkillable processes, hidden data forks in the file systems that you can't see to back up, worms didn't help my point of view.  Reboots after each of dozens of hotfixes, good luck getting your system to work after a service pack.  Hell, you had to reboot after changing IP addresses for fuck's sake!
Worse yet, with NT 4.0, it would constantly forget about licenses.  It allowed you to set the number to whatever you liked, but in a normal environment when you had only 20 users logging on and off, it easily filled up those 20 licenses.  Even if you lied and set it to several hundred, it would forget that some logged off and seize up with "Out of Licenses!"  At one point, I had set it to several thousand and had an AT job (cron for unix guys) restarting the license "service" twice a day just to prevent users from getting kicked off!
Have a software RAID 5 volume instead of a RAID 1 under NT?  Was your OS too hosed to get back up and running? Couldn't restore it with last known good or the registry repair?  Good luck restoring those RAID volumes after a reinstall!  Wasn't impossible, but wasn't easy either.  Exchange server?   Ouch! What a load of overpriced bloatware!  Have fun repairing it's db's or even backing it up without special software plugins.
Excel in a financial environment?  Have fun with the Bloomberg plug-in crashing several times a day.  Multiply by a few hundred guys on a trade floor and welcome to IT HELL!  Thanks, but I'd rather flip burgers than deal with that shit again.
Yeah, NT/2K/XP's gotten a lot better after Win2K, but no thanks, I won't go to XP.  Ever.  That NSA back door key didn't exactly win my friendship over either.  XP's creepy product activation isn't my cup of tea. Windows Media Player's reporting back to Mama what I play or what codecs I use is a no-no in my book too.

I believe the real issue here is one of being able to stretch your mind into seeing things from different points of view.  This is the reason I brought in the quasi-mystical quote about the sphere whose center is To see if you'd be able to go beyond your already rich knowledge and gain new benefit from another way of looking at it.  (IMHO, it's important to be able to change POV's at will, it keeps you flexible and able to learn new ways of dealing with data by conversion.)
In real life, the roots of a tree resemble it's branches buried underground, in an almost mirror image.  A tree that terminates where the trunk meets the ground would fall.  The only real tree resembling this, is one where logger's saw was applied. :)  So we're already not discussing a real tree.
The idealized mathematical definition of a tree doesn't quite a real tree any more than do B-Trees, B+/-Trees, nor red/black trees, or our debated friend, the internet.
Of course. It's called redundancy and its goal is to eliminate as many single points of failure as possible.  But from the point of view of one node talking to another, these aren't considered, I'll explain why.
Firstly, don't confuse cycles with redundancy for high availability.  These are two different things.
Let's explain why we have multiple connections and what types of these you can expect.  There are two common types of multiple connections:
A) Two links to the same ISP:  In terms of redundancy for the purposes of being fault tolerant, only one of the multiple links is ever used.  With most ISP's, when you negotiate a contract for a backup connection, it's with the understanding that you'll only use it when the main one goes down.
B) You have multiple connections to different ISP's (possibly with peering contracts, etc.)  In this case when a node at your location tries to contact some other node on the internet, it's traffic doesn't go over ALL of your connections - it takes only a single path.  [Ok, if your routers are correcting for an outage, then perhaps you'll see different paths being taken, but this is just the routing tables/routers settling or converging.]
If both case A and case B, a single node in your location will see the entire internet as a tree with the root of that tree being the default gateway.  (i.e. go back to doing traceroutes.)  In the case of a multi-homed machine, or machine that participates in routing, it itself becomes the root of the tree.
There are other cases but those are rare, and likely flawed.
Now on to cycles and the whole reason for this debate:
The whole point of many/most routing algorithms is to GET RID OF cycles. After you've done this, you're left with a tree.
Loops/cycles are so anathema to the workings of tcp/ip, that one of the fields in IP packets has been added to help eliminate: the TTL.  The only reason for a TTL value is to prevent packets that are going around in circles from congesting all the routers involved in the loop.  (Only later did traceroute exploit this into helping provide you with a map of where your packets went.)
This is why EIGRP, RIP, etc. use various mechanisms to explicitly prevent routing loops (and BGP to aggregate routes.)  Routing loops are damage, they are by definition not desirable.
At the data link layer (switches/hubs), this is why you want to use the Spanning Tree Protocol.  Notice that name: Spanning *TREE* Protocol.  After STP is done, you're left with a data link layer ->TREE< - not a cyclical graf.  STP is even more important for LAN's than on the internet since there's no TTL on ethernet frames:  a single broadcast, were it to be allowed to loop, could saturate your switches to the point of killing your LAN!
What all this says to me is that a cycle is a circle, and that failover/ parallel links should be collapsed (and are by routing protocols) to a single link.
Once you eliminate cycles, and you do so in real life, you go back to a tree.  You only see the alternate paths used when failover or routing errors occur.
Yes, I agree with you, if your POV is "The Big Picture" above from space, which includes all links, even the unused redundant ones, it's certainly not a tree.
At the same time, I also disagree with you.  If your POV is a single host, it sees the internet as a tree.  In fact, one of the properties of trees is that you "pick up" any leaf node and designate it as the root.  (Doesn't work too well on a B+Tree when you're trying to do searches,  but, the result is still a tree - not balanced any longer, but a tree.)

It is a tree. I'll give you a hint.  Think of this:
"God is like an infinite sphere, whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere."  Nicholas of Cusa.
It is a tree, but to see it, you'll need to find the root.  The quote above is a hint to where the root is.  Replace god with internet, sphere with tree, infinite with 2**32 (at least until it goes to ip6.)
So where's the root?  Scroll down for the answer.
\ /
  V
Did you see it?  No??? It's actually right infront of you.
Still don't know?  Ok then, keep scrolling down.
The root of the internet is your own internet connection.  Proof: If you were to iterate traceroutes over the entire ip4 space (good luck doing that by the way), and graph the results, you'd get a tree.  It's root is your default gateway.

Um, just to point out the absolute obvious, if you're >DRIVING< you already have a power source, even if you have to use an inverter to power your notebook.  At that point you're not worried about worrying about spending a few miliamps on transmission here and there.  It doesn't matter at all whether or not there's a string of other "you's" ahead of you.   Having already paid for the tank of gas, the juice is free, and so should transmission - even routing of other users' data.
If you're in the woods, or at the beach, that's a different story.  :)
Ok, well, if you're at the beach, you could get a solar cell and geek away.
Yup, can't have a network without nodes.
In which case, you won't be to willing to transmit either since receiving costs you far less battery than transmitting.  In this case you're far more likely to store whatever you want to transmit for later - same as working "offline" with a mail user agent.

Shouldn't be a problem if you go the Solaris route and use tmpfs/swapfs with no real swap.  (For those that don't know, Solaris mounts /tmp into virtual memor space, so if you've got tons of RAM, data written in /tmp is actually written in RAM.)

I've not seen, nor played with any of these, *BUT*, heed this warning
which applies to all devices (and software?) that are 1) closed source and 2) offer some useful service which you'd be tempted to place inside your network, 3) are allowed to communicate with the outside world.
I would highly suggest that if you chose to use one of these that you do so from a DMZ in your firewall to be safe.  You don't know what OS/firmware lives there and whether it can be used via the VOIP network to spy on your internal network.
You might need to add another NIC to your firewall, and depending on what else this needs, you might also need to provide a DHCP server for it.  Set the firewall rules to make sure no packets from this device can go into your internal network.  EVER.
Don't just say, "Well this thing is its own router, it does VPN, it has a firewall (does it?) I can trust it."
There will likely be features which it provides (perhaps a voice mail->email gateway?) which will tempt you to place it on the inside network instead of a DMZ.  Don't!  Find a way to secure your network and still provide for such features.
[Or, if you use these boxes inside a corporate environment and actually care about this level of security and want several of these to talk to each other, build another network just for them.  Depending on your needs, I'd also say, don't let them talk to the outside world, but if you do that, only nodes inside your VPN's will be able to communicate over VOIP.]
If you trust this thing to do VOIP, enjoy, (Accepting possible spying on your phone calls by LEO/intel agencies, etc.) but don't trust it enough to put the ethernet end of it on your internal network.  You never know when some bright kid takes one of these apart, disassembles the firmware and finds a backdoor to use against you.
Why the tin-foil sounding rant?  See yesterday's slashdot regarding the recent "hardwired" backdoor account in a Cisco Wifi router which has been exposed resulting in a call for a firmware update.

'Whispering keyboards' could be next attack trend
By Niall McKay, Contributing Writer
11 May 2004 | SearchSecurity.com
OAKLAND -- Listen to this: Eavesdroppers can decipher what is typed by simply listening to the sound of a keystroke, according to a scientist at this week's IEEE Symposium of Security and Privacy in Oakland, Calif.
Each key on computer keyboards, telephones and even ATM machines makes a unique sound as each key is depressed and released, according to a paper entitled "Keyboard Acoustic Emanations" presented Monday by IBM research scientist Dmitri Asonov.
All that is needed is about $200 worth of microphones and sound processing and PC neural networking software.
Today's keyboard, telephone keypads, ATM machines and even door locks have a rubber membrane underneath the keys.
"This membrane acts like a drum, and each key hits the drum in a different location and produces a unique frequency or sound that the neural networking software can decipher," said Asonov.

the gate are a captive audience.
Natch.  I also did see the big red IR lamps behind, but that's old school in almost any toll booth.
Or you OCR license plates which is mostly trivial these days, or a combination of both.  Then again, for upstate NY, you actually get a card for NYS Throughway and
pay when you exit at another tollbooth.  Card has a magnetic stripe, and shows the entry point on the throughway.  So there are obviously other less expensive ways to do just that.  Add cameras with timestamps at each tollboth and a way to keep track of which card was where and you've got a verifiable robust tracking system.

Information overload, challenges of evaluating quality, and the opportunity to benefit from experiences of others have spurred the development of reputation systems. Most Internet sites which mediate between large numbers of people use some form of reputation mechanism: Slashdot, eBay, ePinions, Amazon, and Google all make use of collaborative filtering, recommender systems, or shared judgements of quality.
But we suggest the potential utility of reputation services is far greater, touching nearly every aspect of society. By leveraging our limited and local human judgement power with collective networked filtering, it is possible to promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems . to restrain the baser side of human nature, while unleashing positive social changes and enabling the realization of ever higher goals.

I set the record for most campaign fund raising trips by any president in US history. In my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost their jobs. I cut unemployment benefits for more out-of-work Americans than any other president in US history. I set the all-time record for most real estate foreclosures in a 12-month period. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration positions than any president in US history. I set the record for the fewest press conferences of any president, since the advent of TV. I signed more laws and executive orders amending the Constitution than any other US president in history. I presided over the biggest energy crises in US history and refused to intervene when corruption was revealed. I cut health care benefits for war veterans. I set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously take to the streets to protest me (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I dissolved more international treaties than any president in US history. I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in US history. Members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in US history. (The poorest multimillionaire, Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.) I am the first president in US history to have all 50 states of the Union simultaneously struggle against bankruptcy. I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud in any market in any country in the history of the world. I am the first president in US history to order a US attack AND military occupation of a sovereign nation, and I did so against the will of the United Nations and the vast majority of the international community. I have created the largest government department bureaucracy in the history of the United States, called the "Bureau of Homeland Security"(only one letter away from BS). I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any other president in US history (Ronnie was tough to beat, but I did it!!). I am the first president in US history to compel the United Nations remove the US from the Human Rights Commission. I am the first president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the Elections Monitoring Board. I removed more checks and balances, and have the least amount of congressional oversight than any presidential administration in US history I rendered the entire United Nations irrelevant. I withdrew from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to US prisoner! s of war and by default no longer abide by the Geneva Conventions. I am the first president in US history to refuse United Nations election inspectors access during the 2002 US elections. I am the all-time US (and world) record holder for most corporate campaign donations. The biggest lifetime contributor to my campaign, who is also one of my best friends, presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation). I spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in US history. I am the first president to run and hide when the US came under attack (and then lied, saying the enemy had the code to Air Force 1) I am the first US president to establish a secret shadow government. I took the world's sympathy for the US after 9/11, and in less than a year made the US the most resented country in the world (possibly the biggest diplomatic failure in US and world history). I am the first US president in history to have a majority of the people of Europe (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and stability. I changed US policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I set the all-time record for the number of administration appointees who violated US law by not selling their huge investments in corporations bidding for gov't contracts. I have removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any other president in US! history. I entered office with the strongest economy in US history and in less than two years turned every single economic category heading straight down. RECORDS AND REFERENCES: I have at least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine (Texas driving record has been erased and is not available). I was AWOL from the National Guard and deserted the military during time of war. I refuse to take a drug test or even answer any questions about drug use. (wink,wink) All records of my tenure as governor of Texas have been spirited away to my fathers library, sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records of any SEC investigations into my insider trading or bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All minutes of meetings of any public corporation for which I served on the board are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. Any records or minutes from meetings I (or my VP) attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review. With Love, GEORGE W.

@_subject: proof of censoring decisions they don't like under natsec 
headlines in the last year or more.has seen plenty of redactions (those portions that are blacked out or otherwise made unreadable). This, we're told, is for legitimate reasons, such as "national security" or "protecting intelligence sources and methods." But now we have absolute, incontrovertible proof that the government also censors completely innocuous material simply because they don't like it.
The Justice Department tipped its hand in its ongoing legal war with the ACLU over the Patriot Act. Because the matter is so sensitive, the Justice Dept is allowed to black out those passages in the ACLU's court filings that it feels should not be publicly released.
Ostensibly, they would use their powers of censorship only to remove material that truly could jeopardize US operations. But in reality, what did they do? They blacked out a quotation from a Supreme Court decision:
    "The danger to political dissent is acute where the Government attempts to act under so vague a concept as the power to protect 'domestic security.' Given the difficulty of defining the domestic security interest, the danger of abuse in acting to protect that interest becomes The mind reels at such a blatant abuse of power (and at the sheer chutzpah of using national security as an excuse to censor a quotation about using national security as an excuse to stifle dissent).
It's hard to imagine a more public, open document than a decision written by the Supreme Court. It is incontestably public property: widely reprinted online and on paper; poured over by generations of judges, attorneys, prosecutors, and law students; quoted for centuries to come in court cases and political essays.
Yet the Justice Department had the incomprehensible arrogance and gall to strip this quotation from a court document, as if it represented a grave threat to the republic. Luckily, the court slapped down this redaction and several others. If it hadn't, we would've been left with the impression that this was a legitimate redaction, that whatever was underneath the thick black ink was something so incredibly sensitive and damaging that it must be kept from our eyes.
Now we know the truth. Think about this the next time you see a black mark on a public document.

As seen on:
Rant at Start of Chapter on Society
I write this book during a dark time. America.s government is in the hands of criminals and morons.
I.d like to break through to a radically different way of talking about society, to throw a bucket of ice-water in the face of the sleep-walking sheep who think that history is about presidents and kings.
A baby filling a diaper is infinitely more significant than a congress placing a movement on the floor.
Twin Towers
Facts: The twin towers fell. The terrorists were Saudis. Bush invaded .Ah,. someone might say, .if nobody wanted to fight, we.d be invaded. Look at the twin towers. The world.s not safe... And I would submit that the administration.s reaction to the twin towers was exactly the wrong one. Instead of jumping into the repetitive tit-for-tat class two Israelis-versus-Palestinians mode, the government should have gone class four. What would make men kill themselves while destroying a part of our lovely New York City? What system produced them? Isn.t there a way to get in and jolt it in some totally unexpected way, something more original than rocket fire vs. car bombs?
Before virtually every American presidential election, I.ve heard people say, .If so and so wins, I.m leaving the country.. But they never do. The only time my friends eve remigrated was during the Viet Nam war, a time when the hive mind was undertaking the wholesale slaughter of a generation. But most of the time, for most of us, things aren.t bad enough to make emigration seem reasonable.
If the election is stolen again in Fall, 2004, the answer could be armed revolution, not emigration. If the Bush faction tries to retain power, a significant number of people may feel compelled to go to D.C. and fight in the streets until the tyrant is deposed. However long it takes, however dearly it costs. Would it be worth it?
Hopefully he'll lose the election by too great a margin to fudge. But for that to happen, we have to vote. The popular vote margin matters, if not in the electoral college, then in the hearts and minds of our oppressed populace.

Security Cavities Ail Bluetooth By Kim Zetter
Story location: 02:00 AM Aug. 06, 2004 PT
Serious flaws discovered in Bluetooth technology used in mobile phones can let an attacker remotely download contact information from victims' address books, read their calendar appointments or peruse text messages on their phones to conduct corporate espionage.
An attacker could even plant phony text messages in a phone's memory, or turn the phone sitting in a victim's pocket or on a restaurant table top into a listening device to pick up private conversations in the phone's vicinity. Most types of attacks could be conducted without leaving a Security professionals Adam Laurie and Martin Herfurt demonstrated the attacks last week at the Black Hat and DefCon security and hacker conferences in Las Vegas. Phone companies say the risk of this kind of attack is small, since the amount of time a victim would be vulnerable is minimal, and the attacker would have to be in proximity to the victim. But experiments, one using a common laptop and another using a prototype Bluetooth "rifle" that captured data from a mobile phone a mile away, have demonstrated that such attacks aren't so far-fetched.  + ^ + :"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.  /|\

US terror alert becomes political football
By Thomas C Greene (thomas.greene at theregister.co.uk)
Published Tuesday 3rd August 2004 15:15 GMT
Update As we reported recently ( the latest ratcheting up of the terror threat level in the United States was based on captured documents dating back some time. In that article, we observed that it was "not clear whether any of the information recently obtained relates to current or future schemes."
"much of the information that led the authorities to raise the terror alert at several large financial institutions in the New York City and Washington areas was three or four years old, intelligence and law enforcement officials said on Monday. They reported that they had not yet found concrete evidence that a terrorist plot or preparatory surveillance operations were still under way."
Why now?
If anyone is wondering why terrorism, and especially attacks at home, should have been so fully hyped on such thin evidence, it's useful to consider the news cycle.
Last week, John Kerry did a surprisingly good job of introducing himself to the nation as a plausible replacement for Bush. But this rain dance was not undertaken from a security point of view. It was concocted with a political motive, and its purpose was to distract the public from the additive disasters in Iraq, and the unexpectedly strong showing by the Democrats in Boston last week. It was designed to make Junior look like the "strong leader" that his cheerleaders insist, against all evidence, that he really is. (We note that the true Prince of Darkness, Dick Cheney, has been dutifully silent, and conspicuously absent, during the recent national security festivities, to vouchsafe the limelight to Junior.)

 Justice Department attempting to remove public documents from libraries
American Library Association
July 30, 2004
CHICAGO -- The following statement has been issued by President-Elect Michael Gorman, representing President Carol Brey-Casiano, who is currently in Guatemala representing the Association:
By Anonymous in USA: Liberty Watch on Tue Aug 3rd, 2004 at 08:46:35 AM PDT
Last week, the American Library Association learned that the Department of Justice asked the Government Printing Office Superintendent of Documents to instruct depository libraries to destroy five publications the Department has deemed not "appropriate for external use." The Department of Justice has called for these five public documents, two of which are texts of federal statutes, to be removed from depository libraries and destroyed, making their content available only to those with access to a law office or law library.
The topics addressed in the named documents include information on how citizens can retrieve items that may have been confiscated by the government during an investigation. The documents to be removed and destroyed include: Civil and Criminal Forfeiture Procedure; Select Criminal Forfeiture Forms; Select Federal Asset Forfeiture Statutes; Asset forfeiture and money laundering resource directory; and Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA).
ALA has submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the withdrawn materials in order to obtain an official response from the Department of Justice regarding this unusual action, and why the Department has requested that documents that have been available to the public for as long as four years be removed from depository library collections. ALA is committed to ensuring that public documents remain available to the public and will do its best to bring about a satisfactory resolution of this matter.
Librarians should note that, according to policy 72, written authorization from the Superintendent of Documents is required to remove any documents. To this date no such written authorization in hard copy has been issued.

Computer programmers are modifying a communications system, originally
developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, to help Internet users surf the
Web anonymously and shield their online activities from corporate or
government eyes.
The Navy is financing the development of a second-generation onion-routing
system called Tor, which addresses many of the flaws in the original

Original URL: Al-Qaeda computer geek nearly overthrew US
By Thomas C Greene (thomas.greene at theregister.co.uk)
Published Wednesday 11th August 2004 16:45 GMT
Update A White House with a clear determination to draw paranoid conclusions from ambiguous data has finally gone over the top. It has now implied that the al-Qaeda computer geek arrested last month in Pakistan was involved in a plot to destabilize the USA around election time.
Two and two is five
As we reported here ( and here ( so-called al-Qaeda "computer expert" Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, a Pakistani, was arrested on 13 July in possession of detailed but rather old surveillance documents related to major financial institutions in New York, Newark, and Washington.
Since that time, other intelligence has led the US security apparatus to imagine that a plot to attack the USA might be in the works. (No doubt there are scores of plots in the works, but we digress.) Therefore, last week, the ever-paranoid Bush Administration decided that Khan's building surveillance documents, and the hints of imminent danger, had to be connected. Indeed, if al Qaeda is to strike at all, it is most likely to strike the targets mentioned in Khan's documents, as opposed to thousands of others, the Bushies reasoned.
New York, Newark and Washington were immediately put on high alert, at great expense, and to the inconvenience of millions of residents.

Washington -- Sen. Edward "Ted" Kennedy said Thursday that he was stopped and questioned at airports on the East Coast five times in March because his name appeared on the government's secret "no-fly" list.
"That a clerical error could lend one of the most powerful people in Washington to the list -- it makes one wonder just how many others who are not terrorists are on the list," said Reggie Shuford, a senior ACLU counsel. "Someone of Sen. Kennedy's stature can simply call a friend to have his name removed, but a regular American citizen does not have that ability. He had to call three times himself."

John Ashcroft and the Department of Justice must be stopped.
There, I've said it. Of course, now I half expect federal agents to drag me off to prison for violating the No One Dare Question the Government While We Are Engaged in the War Against Terror Act. (Duration: perhaps forever.) Sure, you say, no such act exists. But Ashcroft himself once testified that bellyaching over what he called "phantoms of lost liberty" only serves to "aid terrorists" and "give ammunition to America's enemies." And recently FBI agents attempted to intimidate political activists by visiting them at their homes to warn about causing trouble at the upcoming Republican convention.
More to the point, under Justice Department guidelines, Ashcroft must approve any subpoena of a journalist, so how do you explain the rash of subpoenas that Special Prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney from Chicago, has doled out to Time magazine, The New York Times, The Washington Post and NBC? Already one reporter -- Matthew Cooper from Time

So there, you go, Mr. Young has become an expert.  What's the problem?

There you go.  They've made their bed, now they can't complain when someone points at it and says "Uh, look at that!"
So, we're back to someone accidentally dropping anchor in the wrong place and boom...  can't have it both ways boys.
So John was simply helping the companies follow Federal Regulations.
Oops, too much publicity, couldn't handle the spin control.
And now the author of this article is feeding the terrorists vital intel - or following Federal regulations?  So is water, so is air, so is everything.  Hell, if the CIA thought they could implant a transmitter in a cat and set the cat loose in a park where Soviets, Commies, and Spies (Oh My!) might talk, what's to stop the terrorists from doing the same style of thing?
Sure, why didn't he also say that flying 747's into high buildings were a stroke of genious too?  Oh, but that would be telling.
Never mind that they ran something called The School of the Americas that trained Terrorists^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HFreedom Fighters in South Americas torture^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hinterrogation techniques, and never mind that when the USSR wanted to take over Afghanistan, our valiant boys were teaching the Afghani Freedom fighters the fine art of asymetrical warfare, some of which I'm sure now belong to Al Qaeda...
Or did we sheeple forget about that incident there?
Yeah, and Napoleon intended to be Emperor of the world too.  Neither happened.  And sure, lots of asteroids out there intended to hit the earth, but that didn't happen either.
Waaaa, we outsourced and didn't plan for an emergency... Waaaa....  Oh wait, what about that electric grid?  IS that fixed yet?  Well is it? No, don't ask Niagra Power, don't ask Con Ed, don't as Ohio Power, dig and find out what caused it.  We still don't know.  Some say it was a Windows virus - if so Billy G should pay for that, some say it was a moron at the switch.  What did happen there?  Yeah, were talking gas in this article, but denial of service is denial of service.  Where's your research Ian? Aren't you just pining for that Pulitzer?  do your homework.  SPouting words like terrorists, fbi, and gas line ain't gonna get you that.  So is every other cub on the beat.
Sure, and if you asked American Airlines if they took security seriously
before 9/10, do you think they'd say "No?"  If you asked my previous immediate boss (at a very sleazy dot.com) if he
took security seriously, he said, and I quote from memory as he did say
this infront of me to a client on the phone "Sure, we do quarterly scans
of all the machines, and we're using a security company, which we're not
at liberty to name, that does scans for Fortune 500 companies and they say
we're secure."  (And no, not a single scan was done, and no security
company was hired, because they were cheap bastards.  The only scan that was done, was by me, only because I wanted to play with Nessus, and boy, it said the opposite of secure, which I then had to patch all them boxes, but this was later on.)
If you had asked the FBI if they cared about terrorists before 9/11, they would have said "Hell yeah, we're gonna get'em all." But if you worked at a Pilot school where a guy wanted to learn how to fly and not land, and you repeatedly called the FBI to look into it, what did the FBI do exactly?  Bubkus?
A-Yup.... so why do reporters bother talking to Spindocs from public
relations instead of doing some investigative reporting and figuring out
the truth instead of eating bullshit with a spoon and smiling for the

Um, didn't we read about backhoes and anchor drops a bit earlier in this article?  Is it red or is it blue?  Is the sky falling or not?
Oooh! Wait! I get it!  they'll wait for an accident with a backhoe, or
boat anchor - or when the wind blows out a pilot light so that they can
blame it on the terrorists! Why? so they can collect on the insurance

Here's the text of part 1:
Consumer Report Part 1: Look at this -- the Diebold GEMS central tabulator contains a stunning security hole
Submitted by Bev Harris on Thu, 08/26/2004 - 11:43. Investigations
Issue: Manipulation technique found in the Diebold central tabulator -- 1,000 of these systems are in place, and they count up to two million votes at a time.
By entering a 2-digit code in a hidden location, a second set of votes is created. This set of votes can be changed, so that it no longer matches the correct votes. The voting system will then read the totals from the bogus vote set. It takes only seconds to change the votes, and to date not a single location in the U.S. has implemented security measures to fully mitigate the risks.
This program is not "stupidity" or sloppiness. It was designed and tested over a series of a dozen version adjustments.
Public officials: If you are in a county that uses GEMS 1.18.18, GEMS 1.18.19, or GEMS 1.18.23, your secretary or state may not have told you about this. You're the one who'll be blamed if your election is tampered with. Find out for yourself if you have this problem: Black Box Voting will be happy to walk you through a diagnostic procedure over the phone. E-mail Bev Harris or Andy Stephenson to set up a time to do this.
For the media: Harris and Stephenson will be in New York City on Aug. 30, 31, Sep.1, to demonstrate this built-in election tampering technique.
Members of congress and Washington correspondents: Harris and Stephenson will be in Washington D.C. on Sept. 22 to demonstrate this problem for Whether you vote absentee, on touch-screens, or on paper ballot (fill in the bubble) optical scan machines, all votes are ultimately brought to the "mother ship," the central tabulator at the county which adds them all up and creates the results report.
These systems are used in over 30 states and each counts up to two million votes at once.
(Click "read more" for the rest of this section)
The central tabulator is far more vulnerable than the touch screen terminals. Think about it: If you were going to tamper with an election, would you rather tamper with 4,500 individual voting machines, or with just one machine, the central tabulator which receives votes from all the machines? Of course, the central tabulator is the most desirable target.
Findings: The GEMS central tabulator program is incorrectly designed and highly vulnerable to fraud. Election results can be changed in a matter of seconds. Part of the program we examined appears to be designed with election tampering in mind. We have also learned that election officials maintain inadequate controls over access to the central tabulator. We need to beef up procedures to mitigate risks.
Much of this information, originally published on July 8, 2003, has since been corroborated by formal studies (RABA) and by Diebold's own internal memos written by its programmers.
Not a single location has yet implemented the security measures needed to mitigate the risk. Yet, it is not too late. We need to tackle this one, folks, roll up our sleeves, and implement corrective measures.
In Nov. 2003, Black Box Voting founder Bev Harris, and director Jim March, filed a Qui Tam lawsuit in California citing fraudulent claims by Diebold, seeking restitution for the taxpayer. Diebold claimed its voting system was secure. It is, in fact, highly vulnerable to and appears to be designed for fraud.
The California Attorney General was made aware of this problem nearly a year ago. Harris and Black Box Voting Associate Director Andy Stephenson visited the Washington Attorney General's office in Feb. 2004 to inform them of the problem. Yet, nothing has been done to inform election officials who are using the system, nor have appropriate security safeguards been implemented. In fact, Gov. Arnold Swarzenegger recently froze the funds, allocated by Secretary of State Kevin Shelley, which would have paid for increased scrutiny of the voting system in California.
On April 21, 2004, Harris appeared before the California Voting Systems Panel, and presented the smoking gun document showing that Diebold had not corrected the GEMS flaws, even though it had updated and upgraded the GEMS On Aug. 8, 2004, Harris demonstrated to Howard Dean how easy it is to change votes in GEMS, on CNBC TV.
On Aug. 11, 2004, Jim March formally requested that the Calfornia Voting Systems Panel watch the demonstration of the double set of books in GEMS. They were already convened, and the time for Harris was already allotted. Though the demonstration takes only 3 minutes, the panel refused to allow it and would not look. They did, however, meet privately with Diebold afterwards, without informing the public or issuing any report of what On Aug. 18, 2004, Harris and Stephenson, together with computer security expert Dr. Hugh Thompson, and former King County Elections Supervisor Julie Anne Kempf, met with members of the California Voting Systems Panel and the California Secretary of State's office to demonstrate the double set of books. The officials declined to allow a camera crew from 60 Minutes to film or attend.
The Secretary of State's office halted the meeting, called in the general counsel for their office, and a defense attorney from the California Attorney General's office. They refused to allow Black Box Voting to videotape its own demonstration. They prohibited any audiotape and specified that no notes of the meeting could be requested in public records requests.
The undersecretary of state, Mark Kyle, left the meeting early, and one voting panel member, John Mott Smith, appeared to sleep through the On Aug. 23, 2004, CBC TV came to California and filmed the demonstration.
On Aug 30 and 31, Harris and Stephenson will be in New York City to demonstrate the double set of books for any public official and any TV crews who wish to see it.
On Sept. 1, another event is planned in New York City, and on Sept. 21, Harris and Stephenson intend to demonstrate the problem for members and congress and the press in Washington D.C.
Diebold has known of the problem, or should have known, because it did a cease and desist on the web site when Harris originally reported the problem in 2003. On Aug. 11, 2004, Harris also offered to show the problem to Marvin Singleton, Diebold's damage control expert, and to other Diebold execs. They refused to look.
Why don't people want to look? Suppose you are formally informed that the gas tank tends to explode on the car you are telling people to use. If you KNOW about it, but do nothing, you are liable.
LET US HOLD DIEBOLD, AND OUR PUBLIC OFFICIALS, ACCOUNTABLE.
1) Let there be no one who can say "I didn't know."
2) Let there be no election jurisdiction using GEMS that fails to implement all of the proper corrective procedures, this fall, to mitigate risk.  + ^ + :"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.  /|\

Federal program to monitor everyone on the road
Interesting article about the Fed's plans to develop an all-knowing intelligent highway system.
    Most people have probably never heard of the agency, called the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office. And they haven't heard of its plans to add another dimension to our national road system, one that uses tracking and sensor technology to erase the lines between cars, the road and the government transportation management centers from which every aspect of transportation will be observed and managed.
    For 13 years, a powerful group of car manufacturers, technology companies and government interests has fought to bring this system to life. They envision a future in which massive databases will track the comings and goings of everyone who travels by car or mass transit. The only way for people to evade the national transportation tracking system they're creating will be to travel on foot. Drive your car, and your every movement could be recorded and archived. The federal government will know the exact route you drove to work, how many times you braked along the way, the precise moment you arrived -- and that every other Tuesday you opt to ride the bus.

Senate Wants Database Dragnet By Ryan Singel  02:00 AM Oct. 06, 2004 PT
The Senate could pass a bill as early as Wednesday evening that would let government counter-terrorist investigators instantly query a massive system of interconnected commercial and government databases that hold billions of records on Americans.
The proposed network is based on the Markle Foundation Task Force's December 2003 report, which envisioned a system that would allow FBI and CIA agents, as well as police officers and some companies, to quickly search intelligence, criminal and commercial databases. The proposal is so radical, the bill allocates $50 million just to fund the system's specifications and privacy policies. To prevent abuses of the system, the Markle task force recommended anonymized technology, graduated levels of permission-based access and automated auditing software constantly hunting for abuses.
{Huh?  How would anonimized access PREVENT abuses?}
An appendix to the report went so far as to suggest that the system should "identify known associates of the terrorist suspect, within 30 seconds, using shared addressees, records of phone calls to and from the suspect's phone, e-mails to and from the suspect's accounts, financial transactions, travel history and reservations, and common memberships in organizations, including (with appropriate safeguards) religious and expressive  + ^ + :"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.  /|\

I see.  I'm sure that Dubbya has his own agenda filled with Shoulds, as
does Bin Ladin, as did Lenin, as did Hitler, as did Nero, as do you.  Each saw (or see) their views as the way to Utopia.  Trouble is, which one
of you megalomaniacs is/was right?
Further to the point, reality is, and what clearly "should" and makes
sense to to you, clearly "doesn't" to another.  The only difference
between you and the others above is that you lack the power to bend
reality to your whims, and IMHO, that is a very good thing.  It is sad the
the above list contained megalomaniacs who did possess that power and used
it to cause great misery to others, and had to be removed from inflicting
their whims on the world at great expense.  Perhaps in a couple of weeks,
US Citizens will vote one of those out the list as he's already done
plenty of damage in the last four years, and save us another miserable four years.
So yes, perhaps, in the fine tradition of what should be instead of what
is, you, sir, should go fuck yourself.

Acoustic Keyboard Eavesdropping
By STEPHEN MIHM
Published: December 12, 2004
When it comes to computer security, do you have faith in firewalls? Think passwords will protect you? Not so fast: it is now possible to eavesdrop on a typist's keystrokes and, by exploiting minute variations in the sounds made by different keys, distinguish and decipher what is being typed. This means that firewalls and passwords will amount to nothing if someone manages to bug a room and record the cacophony of keystrokes. Asonov managed to pull off this feat with readily available recording equipment at a short distance. Even as far away as 50 feet, and with significant background noise, he was able to replicate his success using a parabolic microphone. He also anticipated an obvious practical objection: how does a would-be eavesdropper get into a building and spend enough time to ''train'' a computer program to recognize the keystrokes of a particular keyboard? Not a problem: it seems that keyboards of the same make and model sound sufficiently alike -- regardless of who is typing -- that a computer trained on one keyboard can be unleashed on another.

Original URL: Gait advances in emerging biometrics
By John Leyden (john.leyden at theregister.co.uk)
Published Tuesday 14th December 2004 15:07 GMT
"Great Juno comes; I know her by her gait."
William Shakespeare, The Tempest
Retinal scans, finger printing or facial recognition get most of the publicity but researchers across the world are quietly labouring away at alternative types of biometrics.
Recognition by the way someone walk (their gait), the shape of their ears, the rhythm they make when they tap and the involuntary response of ears to sounds all have the potential to raise the stock of biometric techniques. According to Professor Mark Nixon, of the Image Speech and Recognition Research Group at the University of Southampton, each has unique advantages which makes them worth exploring.

@_subject: Re: Snowden and Compilers 
My guess would be things like network card drivers, or the firmware in
network cards - anything that has supervisor level access to the entire
machine is a prime target, but as more NICs get things like iSCSI
support/ToE and the like, have both opportunity to hide something in the
onboard acceleration engines as well as a mechanism to communicate
upstream. As we've seen there are plenty of "open source" linux kernel drivers for
NICs and video cards that are really binaries.  Plenty of room to hide
stuff there, but the hardware itself is a better target, especially if
the firmware they carry cannot be downloaded by the computer for
forensic analysis, and especially if there's some sort of open DMA
access from the device to the full memory of the machine that the OS
cannot detect.
Maybe they'd add stuff to tcp/udp packets as an out of band channel, or
in the case of wireless stuff transmit on unused nearby frequencies that
the hardware is capable of transmitting on, but cannot be detected with
normal wifi/bluetooth sniffers.
Bluetooth, and wifi would also be great targets because they can
communicate with the outside world, or maybe the USB controllers
themselves because stuff like bluetooth modules are often implemented as
on-board USB devices - at least they are on Mac notebooks.  On Mac
notebooks, the keyboard, bluetooth controller, camera and IR receiver
all run off the USB bus - so that would be a great place to sniff such
traffic, and would also be able to transmit it out to nearby bugs. Even if the OS thinks the device is disabled and not in use, it could
still be able to function as a sniffer/transmitter, and it's power
consumption hidden in a low-power mode.
If you have access to the kernel, or firmware in some critical part of a
machine or the hardware itself, that's more than enough - no need to
subvert the compilers.  There's plenty of out of band access/theft
recovery stuff in most notebooks/servers these days, and compiler
generated output could always be analyzed by folks looking for
vulnerabilities to exploit.
Since there are only a handful of chip manufacturers, subverting those
would be the path of least resistance and most gain, and companies like
Dell, HP, or Apple wouldn't even have to know, nor detect the presence
of such stuff.
The other path is that 90% of the stuff out there runs windows, so you
could always hide stuff as a worm/trojan, which we've seen with stuxnet
and the like.
