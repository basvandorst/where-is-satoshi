@_subject: Use a low cost or free SSL provider(read no legal warchest) VIOLATED! 
So for those of us using the Lower cost tier of SSL cert provider(s) are
definitely hosed at this point(but I figured the NSA had an intermediate
CA in the browser chain someplace,and this is getting to be an old story
and with that Intermediate CA allowed to sign wildcard and same name
certs(in fact with the intermediate CA cert in possession this can be
done on the fly with certain equipment) even private keys correctly
handled(locally generated) fall in the face of this kind of attack. Now
of course I am wondering for folks who knew this and then used the
onsite generator for private key gen as opposed to locally generated
keya via openssl simply had the private key copied off to NSA under the
authority of an NSL.(and given the above scenarios of a MITM cert
generating Intermediate CA does it even matter which way you get fucked?).
      startssl and cheapssl both being US based means a LOT of folks and
 firefox has a browser plugin to detect changes in the server cert BUT
if all looks plausible MOST of us will click right on through(the SSL
infrastructure and governance being hopelessly broken from any rational
point of view...)

@_subject: Human scum in the crypto/security industry industry 
lots of Human scum, snake oil peddlers etc in my industry,
back at Sunsoft in 1994 I used to have to work with
 as he was writing the initial
versions of Firewall-1(was being done on Solaris 2.4 at the time).
He had a desk in Bldg 5 at Sunsoft also
Gil as Wikipedia states( and as
Bamford writes was a member of the Mossad linked Unit 8200.  He was
extremely eager to get FW-1(which Sun had NO source to at that time)
into the hands of Sun Customers.. LOTS of SUN customers.
And given what I was doing at the time for the 5 Sun Companies, I was a
Sun Industrial Relations 'skunk' as in skunkworks there was a bit of
pressure for me to use Fw-1 at my offsite lab(s) and my home lab(NOT), I
already had alternatives.
Fortunately as I was also working with SunLabs we had internally
developed alternatives which we did control all sources for
ie Sunscreen-1, unfortunately there was an insistance we use BSAFE(which
I ALWAYS had a LOT of resistance to) for the SKIP crypto tunnels, as we
are coming to find out..  there were evil reasons for this. Skip had
some internal defenses against such skulduggery such as rapidly
switching out keys.. use of DH.. and both Ashar Aziz and Whit Diffie had
their hand in the design. But if there were flaws in the random number
gen that were not known to us then this puts a whole different light on
things like none of the defenses mean anything when keys were predictable.
     and I used to think John Young had finally skipped over the edge

So far F-secure is worthy of Honor they have chosen to boycott the
conference, as EVERY HONEST security and crypto firm/personnel should
 do.. the next few months will tell both us and the public who we can
start to put on the naughty or nice lists..
Bravo to F-Secure and  Mikko Hypponen, the beginning of Honest security
consulting firms..
 his reason quoted below
I dont really expect your multibillion dollar company or your
multimillion dollar conference to suffer as a result of your deals with
the NSA. In fact, I'm not expecting other conference speakers to cancel.
Most of your speakers are american anyway  why would they care about
surveillance thats not targeted at them but at non-americans.
Surveillance operations from the US intelligence agencies are targeted
at foreigners. However Im a foreigner. And Im withdrawing my support
from your event.
And Trevor Pott Journalist from the Register is also boycotting..

Doesnt Surprise me,
    During the original publication cycle of PGP an effort was made to
reach out to mitch kapor and john perry barlow for aid from EFF but Jim
Bidsoz was already there with his lies that PGP was stolen/purloined
code and thus mitch/perry washed his hands of PGP. FUCK THEM..
FUCK MITCH KAPOR, FUCK JOHN PERRY BARLOW!!
and yes this list and so called movement(HAH!) was founded on Media
Manipulation/Braggarts/BS if you will) of the highest order, It even got
a greater push after we viewed an Inforwar Con V  presentation  in 1994
 called Red Teaming(it was an information attack on the structures of
the press(propaganda with a twist)).
And given Internet Sockpuppets :) its remarkably easy to be ones one
greek Chorus(and press army)..  in fact Anonymous vs the rootkit.com
founder was over "greek chorus" type of sockpuppet software that the
firm was developing , and while javascript turing scripts did pose
initial problems for same(sockpuppet software) when facebook and others
tried implementing them, call outs to the "mechnical turk" and later to
the Selenium plugin nowadays for the amateur efforts quickly solved that
technical issue.
Anonymous remailers have also been remarkably effective in hoodwinking
both the press corp and the public and even members of this list
 to swallow both the malware nostrums(mcafee and others)(hook) and later
PGP/other crypto/security crap (line and sinker).
This kind treatment of the truth was drove our first list foil Detweiler
stark raving bonkers and sent him raving on the list about tentacles of
MEDUSA especially after list participants picked up and started remailer
bombing him with a procmail script that someone thoughtfully published
to the list that would email him several (n+1)slightly different copies
of his own posted mail each time he posted.
Detweilers final demise from his position as one of the privileged
Sysadmins at the University when he carelessly replied to a type one
remailer block that contained his direct supervisors spouse's(wife)
email address among others(the chancellors of the university  email
addresses were included in that block.) thinking that he was instead
replying to one of his sockpuppet harassers(I believe it was tentacle
 who copped to this).
Badda bing Badda boom,, all 83 email addresses he had been abusing from
the university  position where he was employed were gone in 1 hour
etc...as was his job and privileged position from where he abused the
rest of the list.

@_subject: Pretty Curved Privacy.. ECC Curve p25519 util(Bernstein approved curve) 
From the README...
Pretty Curved Privacy (pcp1) is a commandline utility which can be used
to encrypt files. pcp1 uses eliptc curve cryptography for encryption
(CURVE25519 by Dan J. Bernstein). While CURVE25519 is no worldwide
accepted standard it hasn't been compromised by the NSA - which might be
better, depending on your point of view.
Caution: since CURVE25519 is no accepted standard, pcp1 has to be
considered as experimental software. In fact, I wrote it just to learn
about the curve and see how it works.
Beside some differences it works like GNUPG. So, if you already know how
to use gpg, you'll feel almost home.
Lets say, Alicia and Bobby want to exchange encrypted messages. Here's
what the've got to do.
First, both have create a secret key:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -k                            pcp1 -k
After entering their name, email address and a passphrase to protect the
key, it will be stored in their vault file (by default ~/.pcpvault).
Now, both of them have to export the public key, which has to be
imported by the other one. With pcp you can export the public part of
your primary key, but the better solution is to export a derived public
key especially for the recipient:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -p -r Bobby -O alicia.pub     pcp1 -p -r Alicia -O bobby.pub
They've to exchange the public key somehow (which is not my problem at
the moment, use ssh, encrypted mail, whatever). Once exchanged, they
have to import it:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -P -I bobby.pub               pcp1 -P -I alicia.pub
They will see a response as this when done:
 key 0x29A323A2C295D391 added to .pcpvault.
Now, Alicia finally writes the secret message, encrypts it and sends it
to Bobby, who in turn decrypts it:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 echo "Love you, honey" > letter
 pcp1 -e -i 0x29A323A2C295D391 -I letter -O letter.z85
 cat letter.z85 | mail bobby
                                    pcp1 -d -I letter.z85 | less
And that's it.
Please note the big difference to GPG though: both Alicia AND Bobby have
to enter the passphrase for their secret key! That's the way CURVE25519
works: you encrypt a message using your secret key and the recipients
public key and the recipient does the opposite, he uses his secret key
and your public key to actually decrypt the message.
Oh - and if you're wondering why I named them Alicia and Bobby: I was
just sick of Alice and Bob. We're running NSA-free, so we're using other
sample names as well.
There are currently no packages available, so pcp has to be compiled
from source. Follow these steps:
First, you will need libsodium:
 git clone git://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
 cd libsodium
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure && make check
 sudo make install
 sudo ldconfig
 cd ..
Next, pcp:
 git clone git://github.com/tlinden/pcp.git
 cd pcp
 ./configure
 sudo make install
 cd ..
Optionally, you might run the unit tests:
 make test
To learn how to use pcp, read the manpage:
 man pcp1
