I have noticed a display change as well, although I couldn't
tell you exactly how, other than the fonts look a wee bit larger.
Before the switch, I noticed one big difference between using
Claws in XFCE and KDE: in KDE, my folder list had a horizontal
line between each entry (a seam, if you will) whereas the XFCE
didn't. Like your whitespace phenomenon, I've wondered what was
responsible for the lines in KDE.

I just installed 2, cp'ed my config folder and the transition
has been smooth. I have to admit I haven't noticed any
difference yet, though. No disappointment--just an observation.
