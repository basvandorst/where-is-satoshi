@_subject: Re: privacy <> digital rights management 
I have seen "private" and "secret" defined in exactly the opposite fashion
as regards keys:  a "private" key is private because you never ever share
it with anyone, whereas a "secret" (symmetric) key is a secret because
you've told someone else and you expect them to not share it (in the sense
of "can you keep a secret?").
Clearly there's not a common understanding of these simple words.  Seems
to me that Dan's mini-rant was referring to "privacy" in the sense you
define it above (controlling spread of info already held by others).

@_subject: Re: What email encryption is actually in use? 
Pine and UW imapd both support STARTTLS for all relevant protocols
(SMTP/IMAP/POP/LDAP client for Pine, IMAP/POP server for imapd).  They
also support Kerberos authentication and datastream encryption for all
these protocols.
Evolution does?  I tried out the Evolution 1.0.3 that comes with my RedHat
7.3 distribution, and it appeared not to support STARTTLS for IMAP or
SMTP.  When I told it to "use secure connection (SSL)" for SMTP it tried
to connect to port 465 (the deprecated smtps port) and failed.
