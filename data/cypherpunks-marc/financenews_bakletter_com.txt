Volume 235 - January 19th, 2005 Breaking News  Alert For Aggressive Investors
Aggressive investors and traders may be excited                   about the latest news from MSE EcoEngine Inc. (OTC: MSEE).                   Yesterday after the markets closed, the company issued a press                   release confirming that the MSE EcoEngine (the EcoEngine) may                   be used to replace infrastructure size electricity plants. 
This could be great news for investors!  According to the                 press release, Applications for the EcoEngine are diverse and                 municipal electricity plants represent an attractive market for                 us stated J. Gregory Gooch (President).  We are some time away                 from being able to implement the EcoEngine technology on that                 scale, but it is on the horizon said Mr. Gooch. 
Investors watch this one!  The EcoEngine is capable of                 generating power using the free heat in ambient air as its sole                 source of fuel and producing, as by-products, clean water and                 cool air.  The engine will be used as an inexpensive and clean                 source of technology.

In the US there is currently 830,000 megawatts of installed                 generating plants and this is increasing at a rate of over 2%                 per year while obsolescence is another 2.5%. Thus the total                 annual demand for new and replacement generating plants in the                 US is 35,000 to 40,000 megawatts. This represents huge market                 potential for MSE EcoEngine Inc. in this one market segment.
