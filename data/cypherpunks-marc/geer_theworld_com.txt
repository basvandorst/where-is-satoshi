I founded this series in 1995 and was proud to have done so; we ran
them in 1996 and 1998 as well, but the cutting edge quickly moved
away from USENIX's core and forte to where every conference organizer
on the planet had an e-commerce workshop of some sort up and running.
Whether these were technical, financial or sheer hype, the noise factor
was too great and we (USENIX Board of Directors) moved on to other
things where we could make a difference without having to wage an
advertising war in the middle of an investment bubble.
I'm open to suggestions, of course, but in the meantime you might
enjoy reminiscing about 1995 as seen through this lens:

Over the last six months, I'd discovered that Carl Ellison (Intel),
Joan Feigenbaum (Yale) and I agreed on at least one thing: that the
problem statements for "privacy" and for "digital rights management"
were identical, viz., "controlled release of information is yours at
a distance in space or time" and that as such our choices for the
future of digital rights management and privacy are "both or neither"
at least insofar as technology, rather than cultural norms & law,
Last week at USENIX 2002 I tried this out on Larry Lessig as his
keynote had been a takeoff from his recent _The Future of Ideas_ book.
His response was confirming: "Of course they are the same!" and he
went on to describe that when Mark Stefik (Xerox PARC) had submitted
his patent on DRM in the early '90s it had roughly said "wrap data
such that if you try to abuse it it will self destruct."  Sometime
in the late '90s a Canadian inventor had attempted to patent a
privacy technology with the rough description "wrap data such that
if you try to abuse it it will self destruct."  The USPTO denied
the patent request on the grounds that it duplicated an application
that had already been granted.
Speaking personally, if asked "DRM & privacy, both or neither?"
then I will take "both" --  YMMV.

One approach to securing infrequent signing or working keys from a     corporate master certificate is to store the certificate in a bank     safe deposit box. The certificate generation software (say on a self     booting CD or perhaps an entire laptop) could be stored in the safe     deposit box as well. The certificate signing would take place at the     bank, either in one of the small rooms they provide or in a borrowed     conference room.
Dare I mention the CertCo/Identrus threshold crypto
in this context?  CertCo certainly nailed all the
parts of this, e.g., fragment generation in abstentia.
