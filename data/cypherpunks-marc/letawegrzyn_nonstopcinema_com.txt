One morning, on my daily walk, a car stopped alongside me and the woman
driver asked,"Can you do me a favor?""Yes, what is it?" I replied"Please tie
my son's tie," she asked. "It's his first day at school. I'm a single mother
and I don't know how to do it."The boy got out of the car, and we all stood
on the street corner, teaching and learning tie knotting.
A man who wanted to rest on the ground used a jar as a pillow. It was so
hard that he asked his servant to staff it with feathers to make it soft. A
pupil was talking about the recent fire in his school. "I knew it was going
to happen." he said, "Because we've been practicing for it all
year".Computer manufacturers are considering changing the instructional
words "Press Any Key" to "Press Return Key", because too many people have
been calling to ask where the "Any" key is.
One day a Frenchman went to visit his English friend. When he came up to
his friend's house, a big dog ran out and began to bark at him. The
Frenchman was frightened and stopped. At that moment the Englishman came out
and saw his friend. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "Don't you know the proverb
'Barking dogs don't bite'?" "Oh,yes" was the quick answer. "I know the
proverb, and you know the proverb, but, does the dog know the proverb?"
