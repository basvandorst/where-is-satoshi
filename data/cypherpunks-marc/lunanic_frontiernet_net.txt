@_subject: Money Making Ideas Request 
I'm looking for ways to make money on the internet, that is legal, and not
chail letters, or worthless affiliate programs.  No banner exchange, or
spamming email inbox's with Viagra adds, or prescription drugs.  I have two
computers, and I like for them to be doing something, besides wasting
If anyone has any ideas, can you email me?
Thank you!
Luke Nichols
Or send me something tangible by mail:
