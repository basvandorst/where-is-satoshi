This is always the best way to deal with disagreement.
But I think this is the wrong list to tender such contracts. Also, it's odd you
hate DDOS's more than murder. Time to take some time off work perhaps?
For the first time I'm hoping to not meet some of the nanog members in person
at a Nanog conference should I ever attend....

Not to promote equine defibrilation, but just so you all feel better -
summary: no one got hurt, and wikileaks lets the newspapers do the hard work
of redacting info that'd hurt individuals directly.
There has been no loss of lives. But s/lives/political careers/ is a different
matter, and might catalyse hyperbole that some are buying into.
OBONTOPIC: wikileaks has another DDOS going (real DDOS not plain DOS, apparently.)

Let us know if they deviate from this isometric application of policy. I'll be
happy to encourage people not to use them.
Anyone have records of what wikileaks (RR, i assume) A record was? I should
have queried my favourite open rDNS servers before they expired, assuming that
the TTL was long enough (or modified to be long by a local cache policy).
Quick, someone power up their hibernated laptop with the network unplugged and
ping wikileaks (assuming you looked at it recently before hiberation, before
it was pulled... :) Not sure that works in any windows (or other OS's for that
matter) however.

or p2p or tor or torrents of *.tbz's
the other day bloomberg was having issues in their db only for
stories about wikileaks and assange as per my quick testing, quite
annoying, are major news mediae seeing ddos attempts at censorship
(or just leaking at the seams infrastructure issues with the big hits
on the topic?)

And if they come and ask the same but without a court order is a bit trickier
and more confusing, and this list is a good place to track the frequency of and
responce to that kind of request.

No, but i have old drives full of uucp maps around. I'd start with those. And
I'd use the terrestrial phone system to call up/figure out who's still out
there (im friends/colleagues or know how to reach many of the people who ran
my old peers). Once it became clear it was a long outtage, the effort required
to get all this going again would be worth it. I have the tools around to make
it happen, if I needed to, and I know several others who also do. (Maybe time
to keep a copy of uu*.deb around though..)
Oh whoops, except I have a dry copper loop in my house for my dsl.
Dang nabbit. Stupid advancing technology. (During an internet outtage I wonder
if new orders for POTS phone service would be quashed in the interest of
'public safety'... :)

A lot of top level/very popular sites likely have no extra-US
However, shutting the internet down (you know, when they press the
magic button that makes my telebit trailblazer no longer able to do
UUCP) would instantly create a market for services more robust/localized/
culturally-customized than those that suddenly go missing on that day.
(wonder if anyone has contingency plans in the wings waiting for such
an event).
That's a pretty dumbass business decision, IMHO.
Will nevar evar happen. Political and economic suicide.
"internet presence vacuum" - there I coined it.
[ side question, how many of the root servers evaporate on that day? ]
[ additionally, when the usa is shutdown taking 80% of Canada with it,
  (truly, w'iz yr biyatches) do we declare a diplomatic emergency/act of war
   for american actions?  or do we just hang our heads in shame at our poor
   redundancy? ]
I suspect the 'internet kill switch' will be used in far more localized
situations, like containing single ISPs/cells/threat vectors, as required.
(Harkens back to GWB's rarely-mentioned theorizing end-run around Posse
Comitatus suggesting 'who else but the military to contain an epidemic
outbreak' without mention of threat authentication by independent civilian
Popular uprising in city X tweeting out the new version of Rodney King? Good
night and good luck.
