true I don't consider the usecase of 100 torrents on seed and/or
download. I must say I fail to imagine its conditions, but lets leave
that aside as its probably my limited interest in understanding such
uses of torrent. your argument on scalability holds.
of course it does. to me it seems very well written.
ACK, didn't realize that
very interesting.
I'll save that for later, haven't read docs on the matter yet.
there is a tradeoff to this. Tor's popularity makes it an obvious
target and we are mostly loosing this arms-race to law-enforcement
monitoring, which is full-on. not sure how hard will be to detect
torrents, but the call for more relays is admittedly useful. however
that may be just me, yet I doubt, I'm so perverted to prefer, whenever
possible, dinky little private networks that are different and serve
different contexts. My dream is a sort of codified scrambling layer
a'la Vecna's sniffjoke. Not scalable indeed.  But who needs big
amounts of data to travel on P2P, really? these are different
IMHO to be really in the dark one should also not be so popular.. but
OK I get clearly Tor is an attempt at a different strategy.
this would be an interesting conversation.... but I'm not capable to
elaborate further via email now. I think you get what I mean. I recommend keeping an eye on naif's posts, he often provides good
hints on where law-enforcement is at with the... counter tor-rorism
they'll provide a boost, but it won't stay unchallenged for long.
you are right such a study is missing
