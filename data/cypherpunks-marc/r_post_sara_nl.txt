there is a hash calculated over the message, the longer the message, the
longer it takes to calculate the hash (given a particular hash algorithm).
Then the hash is encrypted using your secret key (in RSA), the longer
your key, the longer this step takes (again given a particular hash alg.).
So, a longer key has relatively little impact on the total time, esp.
when signing long messages. (any yes we do this because public/private
key crypto is quite cpu intensive).
Also, because of this, there is a session key generated for each
message, and that key is encrypted using recipients public key when
encrypting a message. So in order to achieve good message security, you
need both a strong rsa key and a strong session key.

As I read the article, last time it took 9 years to generalize the
method used for the special number to any number. Now, my key is valid
for one year, and I expect messages protected by that key to be a secret
for maybe a year longer, that means that at the current rate I'll be
able to use my card for at least 5 more years end maybe longer.
And then still, it takes 11 months on a huge cluster of computers to
factor out my key, or to compare, all of the compute power available in
this country for a substantial amount of time.
I guess you're right, if the nsa is after you, you need stronger keys.
If it's just anybody else, I'd say you'll be safe for a few more years.
Your ssl certificates will have expired by that time, and maybe a 2048
bit openpgp card will be available (at a reasonable prise).
