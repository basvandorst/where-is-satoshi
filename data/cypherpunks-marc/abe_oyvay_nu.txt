I'm' probably
Uhm, ahem, er.... Kerberos, SPNEGO, Shibolleth?
So, I'm probably going to ignite an excrement-storm of flames here, but...
Kerboeros via SPNEGO is already supported in most if not all of the
popular browsers.  Keeps the password close to home.  Scales well for
some variables, and give single-sign-on capabilities
Shibboleth because in most places where one ends up authenticating to
a server, all the server really needs is authorization information.
So, authenticate to your chosen IDP, and get assertions that you can
hand off to any SP that recognizes your IDP.
There are details of course... but it might be easier than developing
an entirely new protocol that nobody yet supports.
