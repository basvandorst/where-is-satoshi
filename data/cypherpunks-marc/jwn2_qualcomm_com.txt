It 's always refreshing when someone posts something truly funny. The "idiots list" ranks right up there with Nixon's enemies list - except it's not as long...

Speculation like this is useful if there exists some means to make the prediction.  As Freeman Dyson wrote some years ago:
There is no illusion more dangerous than the belief that the progress of science is predictable.
I agree future advances in mathematics will likely affect cryptography.  However, I don't think there's any reason to be hasty.
I'm inclined to agree.  Bernstein's paper should be given careful review before everyone starts running off to circulate new keys.
Further, suppose such a machine were already built.  If the estimates of the power consumption are in the ballpark, there ought to be traces of the machine's use in demand for energy in the vicinity of the machine's location.  Obviously, you'd have to look beyond the NSA's (or some other black hat's) electric bill, but sustained consumption of MW of electricity must leave some tracks.  For example, analysis of NOAA data might reveal hot spots around facilities where such a machine might be housed.  I'm sure there are other more subtle clues that could be searched.  Has anyone attempted this sort of analysis?  That would give an indication of an immediate
