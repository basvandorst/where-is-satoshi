I don't really understand the apparent benefit of full disk encryption as opposed to using TrueCrypt partitions. AIUI if you are using FDE then the password is stored in the RAM while the computer is on.
If the computer is seized then the password can be obtained from the RAM.  I base this on Kevin Poulsen's book about Max Vision ("Kingpin") where Vision's FDE password was obtained from the RAM. because he was using the computer when his house was raided.
I would think that using partitions is better.  You use the computer "normally" but if you want to access anything personal then you open the partition.  When you have finished then you close the partition.  Now the password is cleared from the RAM.

Here is an article which details the German federal police's use of keyloggers.
There are also links to Wired's coverage of the FBIs keylogger which are well worth a read.
Keyloggers would, I assume, defeat the whole purpose of Tor since the URL would be recorded and sent to the fedz.
How to overcome?  My impression is that no-one is sending .exe attachments these days but rather exploiting unpatched browsers by tricking people to visiting a site (although of course they can always install it manually).
I suppose that up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware might help if you are on Windows.  And, of course, using NoScript and blocking Flash and suchlike. What would be the situation if you are using Linux (such as Ubuntu for example).  I realise that keyloggers must exist for Linux but would they be more difficult to install?
Is moving to Linux one solution?
