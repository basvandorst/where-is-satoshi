At a talk GNUtoo from Replicant did recently he covered the danger
of some phones' layouts; slides linked from here:
Slide 39 has info about the Galaxy Nexus, explaining that the modem
communicates with the main CPU over HSI, but how it talks to the GPS
is unknown. They also warn that the camera does its work through
shared memory, so could also be a vector for a slightly more
imaginative attack. They didn't cover the Nexus 4, I don't know how
similar the hardware is. Might be worth asking the Replicant team
