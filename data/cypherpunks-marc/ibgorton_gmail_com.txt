Hi Jacob,
I just watched your 30c3 presentation on Youtube.  About halfway through yo=
u described an exploit on Dell servers that uses the JTAG, and then asked; =
"Why did Dell leave a JTAG debugging interface on these servers?=94
There is nothing nefarious or uncommon about an active JTAG interface, espe=
cially on an expensive, warrantee-covered server product that may at some p=
oint in its useful life be sent back to Dell for repair.
JTAG is a very common debugging and configuration port/interface that is us=
ed on all sorts of microchips and embedded systems. Sometimes there is an a=
ctual pinned header on the Printed Circuit Board but even if it is missing =
or covered, the JTAG circuitry can still be accessed on common pins or trac=
es somewhere on the board. On a Dell motherboard there are probably dozens =
of JTAG and other debug pins=85 which could probably be used for various pu=
rposes, but it=92s impossible to eliminate or turn off availability of this=
 kind, they are inherent to the functionality of the device. Some manufactu=
rers do obfuscate and encapsulate sensitive components of their machines (i=
.e., on military parts), but as with anything, physical access =3D=3D owner=
ship of hardware.
(I am a hardware  technician and have used JTAG and similar functionality t=
o debug and repair electronic equipment in the field.)
Thank you for your work, =85quite eye opening. Pretty much, if something ca=
n be done, it has and will be done, by somebody out there.
