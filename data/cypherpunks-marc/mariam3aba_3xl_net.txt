Asalam aleikum,
I salute you and may you have peace in the name of lord.
I also want to apologise for this unsolicited letter to you.It is mandatory i
send it to you due to my present family problems.
I am Mariam Hajia Abacha, the widow of the late Gen.
Sani Abacha former military Head of State who died mysteriously as
a result of cardiac arrest.
Since my husband's death, my family has been under
restriction of movement and that notwithstanding, we
are being molested and constantly under watch by the seemingly
agent, above all, our banks account here and abroad have been
frozen by the Nigerian civilian government.Furthermore,my eldest son
is in detention by the Nigerian Government for more
interrogation about my husband's asset and some vital documents.
Following the recent discovery of my husband's bank
account by the Nigerian government with my son's bank in which a
huge sum of US$700 million and 450 million Dutch Mark was lodged
and 6 billion dollars belonging to my late husband was
seized by the government of Nigeria.All these money have been seized
by the seemingly gorvernment.
I therefore wish to personally appeal to you seriously
and religiously for your urgent assistance to transfer
the sum of $15.5 million United States Dollars into
your account in your country which has already been
lodged in a Global crossing Diplomatic security
Company in abroad by my Late Husband since we can not
leave the country due to the restriction of movement
imposed on the members of my family by the Nigerian
Government and my International passport
impounded(seized) at the Murtala Mohammed
International Airport, Lagos in August 2003.
I have a prove of the Certificate of Deposit with the
telephone and fax number of the security company in abroad, the name of
the head of operation including the telephone and fax number of
the agency whom helped in packaging the consignment.
Presently the consignment is incurring more demurrage
and if the government discovered they might seize the fund
(consignment) that was the reason I was advise by our
Family lawyer(Attorney) for the safety of the fund, to
look for someone who can be a honest and reliable
foreigner that is willing to be of assistance to me by
enabling the fund to be transfered to his account
while you are entitled to 15% of the fund while 3% is
for any expenses which might include your phone
calls,stationary which must be deducted before
Also, if you accept this proposal, I shall give you
the telephone and fax number of the security company in abroad where
the consignment is lodge including agency for verification
and you shall as well forward your data including your telephone and fax number to our Family Lawyer who shall help in the legal
documentation to make you the legal owner of the fund by a prove of an
Affidavit from the Federal High Court for a change of fund ownership
by me which my lawyer shall forward with an application to the
Court to enable the court to issue an legal clearance
certificate as a prove that the fund is no longer belong to ABACHA
FAMILY but you as the new beneficiary which will now empower the
Security company to release the consignment (fund) to you.
Please I will appreciate your quick response weather
you accept this proposal or not to enable me to know the next
step of action and please you can as well use your name or your name
as the beneficiary of the fund (consignment ) .
Yours Sincerely
Mariam Abacha
