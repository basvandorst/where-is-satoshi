This is rather besides the point in modern disk drives anyway. Physical
sectors can get remapped on the fly (which would become only more likely at
the end of media service life) and are no longer guaranteed to map to
physical sectors. As a result, data can be moved out to spare sectors which
may still be perfectly readable afterwards. In addition, remanence can
still be exploited after multiple overwrites in a suitable lab environment
(and while magnetic domains have gotten *a lot* smaller, coercivity has
gone up to match, and sensors have more than kept up with this march down
the scale -- atomic force microscopes can be bought off the shelf).
For secret and below.
Not too surprising, because NSA is the entity that creates such documents
in its assigned role within DoD. These become binding within DoD once they
get promulgated at the appropriate level and are also used elsewhere in US
government, typically by simple reference (e.g. in the case of DoE). DSS have relevant information for industrial applications on their web site
at  Individual services can and do, of course, further specify the general
guidance. NAVSO P-5239-26 is one example of a service (Navy) guideline. Urban legend. And silly, too. For most magnetic media and especially
commodity PCs, the labor cost and downtime for overwriting isn't worth the
bother. Destruction will usually be more efficient anyway. And if for some
reason there are no facilities or procedures for this at a given site, I
believe the media can even be shipped to NSA for proper processing.
