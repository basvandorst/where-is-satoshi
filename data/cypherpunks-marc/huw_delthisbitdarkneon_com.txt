@_subject: Re: Getting Started 
We'll be featuring regular Ruby programming columns in Bitwise (online) starting from the end of this month. Initially we'll aim the tutorials at programmers switching from other languages, aiming to explain the fundamental syntax of Ruby and its approach to OOP (the first lesson, for example, starts with "Hello world" and ends with user-defined classes). From March we will also have occasional features (looking into the nuts and bolts of Ruby) aimed at more experienced Ruby programmers. Hope that helps...
best wishes
