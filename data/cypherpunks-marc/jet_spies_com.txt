@_subject: cite, please? Re: bush wheels out the nukes 
I can't find any specific statement anyone made that the B61-11 weapons are being deployed.  I can find lots of mention of the GBU-28 being used. Pointers, please, to specific mentions of the B61-11
  being deployed?

It's been done that way for years on television vote tallies.  They never use, say, purple and orange, almost always red and blue (and green, I think for independents).  I'm not sure, but I think GOP has always been red and Dems have always been blue.

You might want to do some research on  'thermite welding" -- it's a great way to put wires together as well:

About a year ago I got on a plane and flew cross country with an empty .22LR case wedged in the cleats of my boots.  I discovered it in the hotel while polishing my boots (had a wedding to attend the next morning) and was amused.
I guess they'd pick that up now, and I'd spend a few hours in the back with nurse ratchet and a box of rubber gloves.

It's required for PPV, but not for each PPV.  It's required from time to time because DTV wants to know if you've made any PPV purchases. They also occasionally require a call to verify the receiver's location or when changing the level of service you have.
UTV features are a CAP tier, so there's no need for the unit to dial in to activate that level of service.
The phone line is (obviously) required for WebTV, but that's not what I was thinking about.

Check the privacy policy and user agreement.  When I had a UTV, it didn't show that they collect data until after I'd registered it and it downloaded the most recent privacy policy and system software.
There were two privacy policies -- one for the WebTV part and one for the UTV part.  Microsoft claims that you can "opt out" of all data A telephone connection is required for the DirecTV features, especially if you want to do Pay-Per-View.

Here's an idea -- why not use whatever you use to filter things into your cypherpunks mailbox to first filter out anything from people you don't want to read instead of whining to everyone on the list about how much they send that you don't want to read?

Go read SonicBlue's privacy policy -- they claim to already record all that information and that they will hand it over if ordered by a court or would rat you out if they thought you were doing something

...and they did this at the request of the BBC who paid them to do it.
yeesh.  I don't think anyone came out of this looking good.
making it easier to bypass paying for service than it is on the TiVo, just activate the right tier and presto, UTV service.

Back when I had an UTV, there were ads displayed whenever you went into grid that displayed TV listings.  I found that pretty damn annoying as well.
As for UTV trying any tricks, well, the division no longer exists, as I understand it.  Some elements of the UTV team were folded into another part of the organization.
