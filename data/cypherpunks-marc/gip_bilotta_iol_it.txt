I just wanted to report that today (ok, yesterday actually) I
went to a library *not* specialized in computing stuff, with a
friend of mine; as we were browsing through the computing books
they had (he was looking for a Python manual) I noticed that
there were --in full sight-- a couple of books (in Italian)
about OpenOffice.org
