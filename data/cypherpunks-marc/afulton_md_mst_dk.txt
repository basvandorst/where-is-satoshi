Traditional, liberal or newschool? Depends on how you were raised.
Are we getting political here? Hell, no! This is just to describe
your sex life.
If you're traditional, delete this mail now. Please.
If you're liberal, you get yourself some pills after you've realized that hanging a two-pounds stone from your cock doesn't

If you're newschool, you happily dabble with things others don't
even know about.
Traditionals have already deleted this mail. Ahem.
