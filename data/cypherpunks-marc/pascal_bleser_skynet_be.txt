"Renegade Penguin", again, please do not top-post, it's very annoying,
now *I* have to fix your email layout.
And using real names is much nicer BTW ;)
+1, this list is not for technical issues.
Exactly. Allowing technical topics on this list will kill it (and it's
already damn near the red line).
100% ACK
Houghi is doing a good job at redirecting them, thanks for moderating.
I don't think writing to them privately is the best option.
Could be discussed though.
Read my li^H^H^H email body: /this list is not for technical questions/.
Now, I find that very offending.
1) I don't see anything "hostile" in houghi's reply and if you do, as
houghi asked you about 2 or 3 times, please come up with a better
proposal as for the content of his email - but the following aspects are
not up to discussion: this list is not for technical questions, and
there should be no replies to technical questions
2) our community has a hostile attitude ?
Explain this. Really.
Yes, but on suse-linux-e, which is dedicated to technical issues, not here.
My mood: offended by "what appears to be a hostile attitude, not by one
particular person but more among the group"
