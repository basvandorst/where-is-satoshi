@_subject: From Manhattan 
I am in Manhattan.  I can see a massive smoke plume from the roof of my building but the Met Life (formerly PanAm) building blocks my view of the World Trade Center itself.  The smoke is also visible at street level down the avenues.  Even uptown  there is considerable emergency vehicle traffic headed in a generally downtown direction.  Phone service is working but the system must be deluged as it is sometimes difficult to get a dial tone.  The TV transmitters for NYC are on top of one of the towers so those are gone but I assume the cable feeds are still OK.  The bridges and tunnels to NJ have been closed, the subway is also closed until further notice.  The airports are closed to outgoing flights.  Apparently police perimeters are being set up around the UN and other remaining potential targets.  The stock exchanges and futures exchanges are all closed.  The primary election scheduled for today has been postponed.  The World Trade Center normally has 40,00-50,000 people wo!
rking in it so casualties are likely to be very high, particularly as the upper floors of both buildings have now collapsed.  The mood here is obviously tense but people are still going about their business.  I have noticed a few people looking up when they hear a plane overhead.  There is considerable anger as well as universal willingness to help out if possible.  While Manhattan is physically cut off pretty completely there is no rush that I can see to get out (stranded commuters are resigned to spending the night most likely in hotels or with friends), nor any expectation of further strikes, though obviously the police are taking numerous precautions.  All things considered it seem surprising normal, except for the visible smoke and extra high siren level, though tense, here, but of course I am uptown someone closer to the scene will no doubt have a different experience.

As a Manhattan resident, personally unhurt though I don't know about all of my firends and acquaintances.  Thanks for donating blood and thanks for spreading the idea.

@_subject: Manhattan Mid-Afternoon 
I have been out trying to give blood.  At this point all hospitals and blood donation centers have been inundated with volunteers and are only taking Types O+ and O- which are the universal donor types.  Anyone in the area with those types should try to donate today.  They are asking the rest of us to come back tomorrow or later in the week as they expect the need for blood to be protracted.  All the subways were closed but are now running again as are the city buses, the bridges and tunnels are still closed to non-pedestrian traffic I hear.  Most businesses have closed for the day and sent people home who are all walking on the street.  Banks, drugstores and grocery stores are still open, and busy.  Passing the &th regiment armory on Park Ave, the national guard are reporting apparently to help in cordoning off and cleaning up the WTC area.  I also stopped at the grocery store on my way home, it was crowded, a bit more than the last blizzard, but there are still items on the shelves.  There is a small amount of non-official traffic, but a number of streets are closed off.  I did however see a couple of lage cranes headed downtown.  Some street with power sub-station or telephone switching facilityes are closed off and barracaded with NYC garbage trucks or Dept. of Transportation concrete mixer trucks.  There are a handful of F-15's circling over Manhattan, the r!
est of the normal overhead air traffic is nonexistent at the moment.  Police and police auxilary are out directing traffic at major intersections, manning barricades and walking about answering questions.  I have not been south of mid-town so I can't speak of lower Manhattan where the attack was but here there has been no "panic".  The sidewalks are very crowded, people are somber and tense but don't seem to anticipate anything else here in the city and ae quite willing to help if possible.  The lines at both the Manhattan Blood center and at Lennox Hill Hospital were around the block with people waiting to donate blood.
The plume of smoke is still rising and plainly visible from any rooftop and at ground level looking down the avenues.  So far the infrastructure of the City seems to be handling things.  The broadcast tower at the WTC is gone so some broadcast TV and radio are out, but other local stations are still on the air and the cable feed appears unaffected.  The subways are not running but were apparently shut down for fear of a terrorist act.  The subway line does not run through the WTC anyway.  The PATH train to NJ does however.  It is apparently out but how badly or if at all the tunnels were damaged I cannot say.  All the financial markets are closed, it is not clear when the stock exchange will reopen, I have heard a rumor it may close for the week.  It is not close enough I think to have been damaged but it seems that all downtown is shut off and will be for some time until the the fire is under control and the area has been cleaned up, that could be a while.  Phone and intern!
et service is still up though the network is burdened, earlier today I had some difficulty getting a dial tone but not now.  Obviously the City has been the target of a major terrorist attack, but except for a few people fleeing immediately after the attack I have heard of no one leaving. The official response seems to have been very efficient in terms of deploying to protect other potential target, particularly the city's infrastructure.  I cannot speak of the response at the WTC not having been there but it seems they have called in everyone and everything that can possibly be of use in the situation though with an attack of this magnitude that still may not be enough.

@_subject: Re: SYMBOL 
I agree completely that the real issue will be economics.  Though, as I remeber, like most Manhattanites I try to tune "the Donald" out when he started spouting, the issue wil Trumps proposal to build the world's tallest building in the old railroad yards he is developing on the West Side was not the economics of the building, which he thought worked, but rather his inability to get the necessary zoning approvals.
Another developer, Silvestein, had a 99 year lease on the WTC while the Port Authority continued to own the property.  Siverstien has already called for the site to be redeveloped, though what if any rights he enjoys to do so under the 99 year lease on now non-existent buildings I don't know.  As Trump seems at the moment at least to be syclically solvent I am sure he will make a high profile proposal to redevelop the site as well.

Earlier this year I saw an interesting presentation at the NY Academy of Sciences by the head science guy from Genencor Int'l.(  )  He talked about some of the long range research they are doing about enzymes which will allow them to use protiens, starches and cellulose from agricultural sources to make useful polymers.  They are a long way from replacing oil as the feedstock but the research they are doing is pretty interesting though not really focused on automotive fuel so much as other "petrochemicals".

One more bit of debunking.  According to the EIA the US uses on average over 8 million barrels of gasoline a day.  The petroleum industry defines a barrel as 42 gallons.  That's 336 million gallons a day or 123 billion gallons a year.  If each gallon is subsidized by $10+ per barrel, the annual sudsidy from the government to the oil industry would be, at a minimum, $1.23 trillion a year.  Total GDP in 2000 was only $9.2 trillion.  This is non-sense.  Or is this subsidy desquised as the defense budget, social security payments and service on the national debt?
