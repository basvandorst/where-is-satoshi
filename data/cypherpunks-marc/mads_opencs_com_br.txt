Dobbertin published a complete break of MD4 (namely, a breaking algorithm and some collisions found with it) in the Journal of Cryptology.

So what's the status?, the MD5 collisions has been confirmed by Eric Rescorla (taken the type into consideration), the MD4  by David Shaw, what about Haval and RipeMD?.
I did a test on the RipeMD results and couldn't get the results written. Anybody else having the same problems?
Any news on Antoine Joux and his attack on SHA-0? how did he create the collision previously announced on sci.crypt?
