The thing that struck me about the footage is that there were about four
adults and a couple of kids. There were more people not celebrating.
The footage was introduced as mass demonstrations. However that is not what
the footage shows.
During the Falklands war the BBC showed us Argentine news footage claiming
to be showing footage of the front landing gear of a shot down Harrier. The
commentary ridiculed the Argentine claim that it was a Harrier stating
categroically that Harrier landing gear looked different, however that is
exactly what it was later demonstrated to be.

My suggestion is that the UK govt. arrest all non-EU employees of 'Havenco' for illegally working without a visa the minute they set
foot on the mainland.
The platform has been in UK terrirotial waters for many decades now.
It has always been a question of when and not if the authorities shut
down Sealand and havenco. Set up a company whose sole purpose is to
help criminals evade the law and you are going to get squished sooner
or later.

Methinks you complain too much.
PKI is in widespread use, it is just not that noticeable when you use it.
This is how it should be. SSL is widely used to secure internet payment
transactions. S/MIME use is significant and growing.
The financial industry is not looking at offline PKI models in general. This
is not surprising since they use very few offline systems. Hence
certificate/CRL based models which were first promoted for use with email
are tending to be replaced by online systems such as OCSP and ultimately
XKMS which allows the certificate to be dispensed with entirely if required.
What we are not seeing is demand for naming semantics of the form 'the
person who fred call's jim'.
As for what PKI vendors have been up to, the sucessful ones have been
supporting private label certification hierarchies from the start.
