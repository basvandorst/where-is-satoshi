@_subject: Internet Voting, Safely 
Recently there has been publicity about a report critical of a proposed
internet voting experiment,   The authors
critique the SERVE system, which was designed to allow overseas military
personnel to vote absentee via the internet. The authors were four
members of the SPRG (Security Peer Review Group), a panel of experts
in computerized election security that was called upon to review the
SERVE project.
While the report makes many good points, any realistic appraisal of the
prospects for internet voting must look beyond the current state of the
art in security technology.  It will take years before internet voting
can become widely available, and in that time we can expect currently
planned security improvements to be implemented and fielded.
In particular, the advent of Trusted Computing, principally in the form of
Microsoft's Next Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB), offers a number
of features which should address the most significant security-related
limitations and problems for the widespread use of internet voting.

I have to take a look at this. Using racoon was my first idea because it
seems to be the "official" Linux thing these days and is portable to the
*BSDs, too. It's probably only the NIH syndrome at work.
Also, using pluto suffers from the general FreeS/WAN problem of not allowing
contributions from USAians. Anyway, thanks for the reminder - while the project is still at the "half-assed idea tossing" state, hacking FreeS/WAN should still be an

As of mid 2000 most of traffic is recorded. By this time 'most' is very close to 'all'. But if you e-mail someone with account on the same local ISP, using dial-in at the recipient is also using dial-in, and ISP didn't farm-out dial-in access, then your message may not be backed up forever.

Praise Allah!  The spires of the West will soon come crashing down!
Our Brother wishes for us to meet at the previously discussed
southeastern roadhouse on August 1st, in preparation for the
operations scheduled for August 6th and 9th.
Alternative targets have been chosen.  Contact Jibril if you have not
heard of the changes since the last meeting.  The infidels have machines
that detect the biologicals, so make sure the containers are sealed and
scrubbed as discussed.
Leave excess semtex behind.  The more we transport, the more likely the
infidels are to detect us.
We have received more funding and supplies from our brothers in Saudi
Arabia and Syria.  Be prepared for another operation before January.
Praise Allah!  May the blood of the infidels turn the oceans red!

They claim they have over 1 million users. Is a class action suit in order? Their privacy policy clearly states "We consider your email address to be confidential information. We will never rent, sell, or otherwise reveal it to any other party without prior consent, except under the conditions set forth in the User Agreement for spamming and related abuses of netiquette, or unless we are compelled to do so by court order."

Recently I received the Anonymizer "PrivacyShield Alert", as an Anonymizer user, and was distressed to note that it appears Anonymizer has now outsourced its mail and marketing infrastructure.
Partial headers from new mail system:
Return-Path: Received: from anonymizer.lyris.net ([64.62.197.139])
The previous mail messages appeared to have "local to Anonymizer" mail delivery systems sending them.
Does it bother anyone else that Anonymizer is outsourcing its customer

Out of nowhere cometh Steve Thompson, and sayeth he all manner of things.  But, while his mouth moveth one way, he seemeth to move the other.
What hath suddenly attracted our AUK creep?
