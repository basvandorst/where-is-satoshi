Agreed, but how cheap/easy are variations in the Earth's rotations to check?
Remember, the whole point of the exercise is to minimize the asymmetry ratio of checking-costs to manipulating-costs, and to make checking-costs cheap enough that many, many checkers will be checking.
The Bitcoin blockchain is cheap to check, and there are a lot of folks who have much more to lose than a few seconds if the blockchain has been tampered with.  The Bitcoin blockchain is still a little too easy to manipulate; future digital currencies with orders of magnitude more transactions will be far harder to manipulate.  E.g., many still feel that the Fed is manipulating even the S&P500 these days with "plunge protection":

I like this AC hum idea for a crypto clock, except that:
1.  It is highly local, so you need recordings from your local power provider to provide a time base.
2.  All of these recordings have to be done by multiple, independent parties, so that collusion among the parties can be ruled out.
Perhaps a better source would be something that couldn't possibly be hacked -- e.g., variations in solar flux of neutrinos or other solar variations.  There are lots of laboratories around the world recording solar phenomena, so perhaps some combination of these records could become a non-hackable clock.

For most purposes, the time priority relative to some other events
_not under any one organization's control_ is more important than
some nominal time value.  After all, almost all digital devices
these days include some form of a clock; the problem is, we can't
believe these clock values unless they are "laced up" with external
events in such a way that the clock values can't have been spoofed
by very much.
So no, the nominal clock value in the Bitcoin blockchain is no
more trustworthy than my computer's own clock.
That having been said, a proper Internet crypto clock _would_
make a much better attempt to correspond with real GMT, and
_would_ attempt to produce a strict monotonically increasing
series of nominal clock values, in addition to its crypto
hash "ticks".

Yes, one could do as you say, but _checking_ this calculation isn't going to be easy unless a large number of place on the Internet _store the appropriate sequences_.  You then have the problem of _checking that all (or most) of these sequences are the same_.
In the case of the Fortune 500 or the Dow Jones share prices, a large number of sources _already publish_ these numbers, so you only have to go check a sufficient number (for your purposes) of probes to these public databases to convince yourself that they are all consistent, and then perform your checking calculations on the published share prices.
Other sources might be sec.gov, which store all the submissions by public companies of their quarterly reports, changes in ownership, etc.  While the current sec.gov makes no attempt (that I'm aware of) to blockchain these submissions, it would be pretty easy to change sec.gov to require a "previous" hash for incorporation into any SEC report submission, and this would have the effect of partial ordering all the submissions in such a way that it would be essentially impossible for _anyone_ to change the ordering (including the SEC itself), without everyone else being about to notice that someone was trying to make a change.
It would be nice to have an in-the-clear/public Internet database with the following properties:
1.  The database is readonly, appendonly.
2.  Everyone sees the same database, and can "easily" ("without inordinate amount of effort") check this (somehow).
3.  Everyone can easily see _every element of this database_, and thus there is no possibility of tampering or censorship.
4.  Because everything is cross-hashed in various ways, it becomes impossible to delete any information in this blockchain.
5.  Because everything is cross-hashed & cross-coded in various ways, it becomes impossible to "redact" any information in this database.  I.e., you can't even follow the chain without having _every bit_ of every item in the portion of the chain you're trying to follow.
6.  If someone comes up with a piece of data that purports to come from this database, it should be easy to check this database that the data is indeed already there.
7.  Everyone -- in the sec.gov case "every public company" -- can submit an addition to this database.  Yes, there are issues about proper authentication of the submission to make sure that it is indeed from that public company, but this is garden-variety PKE.
sec.gov itself is a pretty good example where such a database makes sense.  Everything is supposed to be public; so now all we need is to make sure that it can never be tampered with--even by someone at the SEC.  If someone submits a report in error, the error can be explained, but will remain ever-after in this database.  The possibilities and harm from corruption are orders-of-magnitude more than the harm/embarrassment from repaired errors, so that such an incorruptible database is essential.
The same idea could be used in a wide variety of instances where there is a "server" and "people" to be served.  The order-of-arrival of the people served by the server is completely arbitrary, but once this serving order has occurred, it is completely nailed down into a linear order that can't later be spoofed.

No.  But I would like to see some simple, robust Internet crypto services, starting with a simple crypto clock with reasonable resolution that can't be hacked by anyone, not even the NSA.
To a first approximation, the Bitcoin blockchain is the only current candidate, although at a much coarser resolution, a hash of all of the Fortune 500 daily closing stock prices would also function.
If there are any other candidates -- e.g., NIST "beacons" with some less-corruptible authentication mechanism -- that have the same level of non-hackability, I'd be interested in finding out about them.

[I'm quite new to this mailing list, so I hope that the following question isn't embarrassingly trivial.]
In old B/W movies, when a person was kidnapped, the kidnapper sent a photo of the person together with a picture of the front page of today's newspaper to prove that he had the kidnapped person _on or after the date_ of the newspaper.
In this case, the newspaper headlines for that date are unknowable in advance, so the recipient of the photo can establish an earliest date bound for the photo.
In today's Internet world, one could presumably do the same thing with a crypto hash of the current contents of the NYTimes, but this is now quite difficult to check because the "front page of the NYTimes" is no longer very constant, various versions are served up to different viewers ("A/B testing"), and I doubt that anyone is keeping track of exactly what pages are being served up at exactly what times.
One could also hash the closing bid/ask prices for N stocks on the NYSE; since this information is kept for long periods of time, it could be far more reliable.  Unfortunately, these closing prices are available only once per day, 5 days a week.
Another possibility would be to capture a hash of a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain at a particular time.  However, I don't know how easily one can search backwards in the Bitcoin blockchain to check for when a particular crypto clock value occurred.
It's clear that any crypto clock would have to be a simple append-only, read-only database whose future values cannot be predicted.  It would be nice to be able to quickly search such a database, but since most searches would be querying about relatively recent events, even backwards linear searching wouldn't be too bad.
Since we are free to choose the format of our authenticated crypto clock value, we can easily include an index of what wall clock time it thinks it is, so a simple RAM access to the database will be able to check the value.  Assuming authenticated values, we can also trivially compare two such values to determine if one "time" precedes another "time".
I would imagine that the best agency to publish such a crypto clock value would be the National Bureau of Standards, using their existing time servers.
Does such a standardized "crypto clock" currently exist?

Should 3rd Amendment prevent government spying?
Glenn Harlan Reynolds 11:24 a.m. EDT July 22, 2013
Technological advancements could call for an update to the amendment that protects us in our homes.
* Troop quartering also violated the notion of the home as a castle.
* Now we have electronic troops in the form of software, gadgets, and sensors.
* It seems clear that our government feels entirely comfortable violating people's right of privacy.
So a couple of weeks ago, I wrote about a Third Amendment case from Nevada in which a family's home was literally seized and occupied by police seeking a vantage point over their neighbor's home.  That case falls pretty much within the literal language of the Constitution's Third Amendment, which provides: "No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law."
But that led to some further thoughts.  When the Framers drafted the Third Amendment, they had a specific evil in mind: The quartering of troops "upon" a population by the English crown.  As the term suggests, this wasn't just about getting a cheap place for soldiers to stay.  Forcing citizens to put up troops in their homes was expensive and the troops -- then drawn from the jails and gutters, for the most part -- were likely to rob, rape and assault members of the household at the least provocation.  Troop quartering was a way to punish a restive region that had been resisting the government.
But beyond that, troop quartering also violated one of the classic "rights of Englishmen," the notion of the home as a castle.  As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said in one of the few Third Amendment cases ever to be heard, the Amendment was designed to assure a fundamental right of privacy.  If you think of it that way, what things does the government do that violate that privacy right today?
If the government places a surveillance device in your home, is that sufficiently like quartering troops there to trigger Third Amendment scrutiny?  What if it installs spyware on your computer or your cable modem?  What if it requires "smart meters" that allow moment-to-moment monitoring of your thermostat settings or toilet flushes?
The famous birth-control case of Griswold v. Connecticut invoked the Third Amendment, along with several others, with the Court asking, "Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?  The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship."  If physically searching the bedroom is "repulsive," what about activating the camera on someone's laptop for remote viewing?  Or monitoring the "Skype sex" sessions of spouses who are apart?  How could that possibly be less repulsive?
These specific concerns weren't what the Framers had in mind.  In their day, to spy on a family in its own home, you'd have to put a soldier there.  But now we have electronic troops in the form of software, gadgets and sensors.  Maybe the law needs to take account of this.  We have updated our interpretations of the First Amendment to go beyond hand-operated letterpresses, the Second Amendment to go beyond flintlocks, and the rest of the Bill of Rights to account for technological change of all sorts.  Why not the Third Amendment, too?
In the wake of the various government-spying scandals that have broken this summer, it seems clear that our government feels entirely comfortable violating people's fundamental right of privacy, whether in their homes or out of it.  Big Brother wants the whole haystack of your data, in case it should later decide to look for a needle in there somewhere.  Should we invoke the Third Amendment to ensure that your home, at least, is safe?

Authentication only requires that only the sender/moderator

validate, while also validating the "previous message

with email addresses in a more-or-less backwards compatible

It would also be possible to sign-encrypt-sign, so long

How the NSA=92s Firmware Hacking Works and Why It=92s So Unsettling
By Kim Zetter 02.22.15 8:09 pm
One of the most shocking parts of the recently discovered spying network Eq=

mputer hard drive=92s firmware with malicious code.  The Kaspersky research=
ers who uncovered this said its ability to subvert hard drive firmware=97-t=
he guts of any computer=97-=93surpasses anything else=94 they had ever seen.
The hacking tool, believed to be a product of the NSA, is significant becau=
se subverting the firmware gives the attackers God-like control of the syst=
em in a way that is stealthy and persistent even through software updates. =
 The module, named =93nls_933w.dll=94, is the first of its kind found in th=
e wild and is used with both the EquationDrug and GrayFish spy platforms Ka=
spersky uncovered.
It also has another capability: to create invisible storage space on the ha=
rd drive to hide data stolen from the system so the attackers can retrieve =
it later.  This lets spies like the Equation Group bypass disk encryption b=
y secreting documents they want to seize in areas that don=92t get encrypte=
Kaspersky has so far uncovered 500 victims of the Equation Group, but only =
five of these had the firmware-flashing module on their systems.  The flash=
er module is likely reserved for significant systems that present special s=
urveillance challenges.  Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky=92s Global Rese=
arch and Analysis Team, believes these are high-value computers that are no=
t connected to the internet and are protected with disk encryption.
Here=92s what we know about the firmware-flashing module.
How It Works
Hard drive disks have a controller, essentially a mini-computer, that inclu=
des a memory chip or flash ROM where the firmware code for operating the ha=
rd drive resides.
When a machine is infected with EquationDrug or GrayFish, the firmware flas=
her module gets deposited onto the system and reaches out to a command serv=
er to obtain payload code that it then flashes to the firmware, replacing t=
he existing firmware with a malicious one.  The researchers uncovered two v=
ersions of the flasher module: one that appears to have been compiled in 20=
10 and is used with EquatinoDrug and one with a 2013 compilation date that =
is used with GrayFish.
The Trojanized firmware lets attackers stay on the system even through soft=
ware updates.  If a victim, thinking his or her computer is infected, wipes=
 the computer=92s operating system and reinstalls it to eliminate any malic=
ious code, the malicious firmware code remains untouched.  It can then reac=
h out to the command server to restore all of the other malicious component=
s that got wiped from the system.
Even if the firmware itself is updated with a new vendor release, the malic=
ious firmware code may still persist because some firmware updates replace =
only parts of the firmware, meaning the malicious portions may not get over=
written with the update.  The only solution for victims is to trash their h=
ard drive and start over with a new one.
The attack works because firmware was never designed with security in mind.=
  Hard disk makers don=92t cryptographically sign the firmware they install=
 on drives the way software vendors do.  Nor do hard drive disk designs hav=
e authentication built in to check for signed firmware.  This makes it poss=
ible for someone to change the firmware.  And firmware is the perfect place=
 to conceal malware because antivirus scanners don=92t examine it.  There=
=92s also no easy way for users to read the firmware and manually check if =
it=92s been altered.
The firmware flasher module can reprogram the firmware of more than a dozen=
 different hard drive brands, including IBM, Seagate, Western Digital, and =
=93You know how much effort it takes to land just one firmware for a hard d=
rive?  You need to know specifications, the CPU, the architecture of the fi=
rmware, how it works,=94 Raiu says.  The Kaspersky researchers have called =
it =93an astonishing technical accomplishment and is testament to the group=
=92s abilities.=94
Once the firmware is replaced with the Trojanized version, the flasher modu=
le creates an API that can communicate with other malicious modules on the =
system and also access hidden sectors of the disk where the attackers want =
to conceal data they intend to steal.  They hide this data in the so-called=
 service area of the hard drive disk where the hard disk stores data needed=
 for its internal operation.
Hidden Storage Is the Holy Grail
The revelation that the firmware hack helps store data the attackers want t=
o steal didn=92t get much play when the story broke last week, but it=92s t=
he most significant part of the hack.  It also raises a number of questions=
 about how exactly the attackers are pulling this off.  Without an actual c=
opy of the firmware payload that gets flashed to infected systems, there=92=
s still a lot that=92s unknown about the attack, but some of it can be surm=
The ROM chip that contains the firmware includes a small amount of storage =
that goes unused.  If the ROM chip is 2 megabytes, the firmware might take =
up just 1.5 megabytes, leaving half a megabyte of unused space that can be =
employed for hiding data the attackers want to steal.
This is particularly useful if the computer has disk encryption enabled.  B=
ecause the EquationDrug and GrayFish malware run in Windows, they can grab =
a copy of documents while they=92re unencrypted and save them to this hidde=
n area on the machine that doesn=92t get encrypted.  There isn=92t much spa=
ce on the chip for a lot of data or documents, however, so the attackers ca=
n also just store something equally as valuable to bypass encryption.
=93Taking into account the fact that their GrayFish implant is active from =
the very boot of the system, they have the ability to capture the encryptio=
n password and save it into this hidden area,=94 Raiu says.
Authorities could later grab the computer, perhaps through border interdict=
ion or something the NSA calls =93customs opportunities,=94 and extract the=
 password from this hidden area to unlock the encrypted disk.
Raiu thinks the intended targets of such a scheme are limited to machines t=
hat are not connected to the internet and have encrypted hard drives. One o=
f the five machines they found hit with the firmware flasher module had no =
internet connection and was used for special secure communications.
=93[The owners] only use it in some very specific cases where there is no o=
ther way around it,=94 Raiu says.  =93Think about Bin Laden who lived in th=
e desert in an isolated compound=97-doesn=92t have internet and no electron=
ic footprint.  So if you want information from his computer how do you get =
it?  You get documents into the hidden area and you wait, and then after on=
e or two years you come back and steal it.  The benefits [of using this] ar=
e very specific.=94
Raiu thinks, however, that the attackers have a grander scheme in mind.  =
=93In the future probably they want to take it to the next level where they=
 just copy all the documents [into the hidden area] instead of the password=
.  [Then] at some point, when they have an opportunity to have physical acc=
ess to the system, they can then access that hidden area and get the unencr=
ypted docs.=94
They wouldn=92t need the password if they could copy an entire directory fr=
om the operating system to the hidden sector for accessing later.  But the =
flash chip where the firmware resides is too small for large amounts of dat=
a.  So the attackers would need a bigger hidden space for storage.  Luckily=
 for them, it exists.  There are large sectors in the service area of the h=
ard drive disk that are also unused and could be commandeered to store a la=
rge cache of documents, even ones that might have been deleted from other p=
arts of the computer.  This service area, also called the reserved are or s=
ystem area, stores the firmware and other data needed to operate drives, bu=
t it also contains large portions of unused space.
An interesting paper (.pdf) published in February 2013 by Ariel Berkman, a =
data recovery specialist at the Israeli firm Recover, noted =93not only tha=
t these areas can=92t be sanitized (via standard tools), they cannot be acc=
essed via anti-virus software [or] computer forensics tools.=94
Berkman points out that one particular model of Western Digital drives has =
141 MB reserved for the service area, but only uses 12 MB of this, leaving =
the rest free for stealth storage.
To write or copy data to service area requires special commands that are sp=
ecific to each vendor and are not publicly documented, so an attacker would=
 need to uncover what these are.  But once they do, =93[b]y sending Vendor =
Specific Commands (VSCs) directly to the hard-drive, one can manipulate the=

=94 Berkman writes.  It is also possible, though not trivial, to write a pr=

a proof-of-concept program to read and write a file of up to 94 MB to the s=

NSA Interns to the Rescue
The document (.pdf) is essentially a wish list of future spy capabilities t=
he NSA hoped to develop for its so-called Persistence Division, a division =
that has an attack team within it that focuses on establishing and maintain=
ing persistence on compromised machines by subverting their firmware, BIOS,=
 BUS or drivers.  The document lists a number of projects the NSA put toget=
her for interns to tackle on behalf of this attack team.  Among them is the=
 =93Covert Storage=94 project for developing a hard drive firmware implant =
that can prevent covert storage on disks from being detected.  To do this, =
the implant prevents the system from disclosing the true amount of free spa=
ce available on the disk.
=93The idea would be to modify the firmware of a particular hard drive so t=
hat it normally only recognizes, say, half of its available space,=94 the d=
ocument reads.  =93It would report this size back to the operating system a=
nd not provide any way to access the additional space.=94  Only one partiti=
on of the drive would be visible on the partition table, leaving the other =
partitions=97-where the hidden data was stored=97-invisible and inaccessibl=
The modified firmware would have a special hook embedded in it that would u=
nlock this hidden storage space only after a custom command was sent to the=
 drive and the computer was rebooted.  The hidden partition would then be a=
vailable on the partition table and accessible until the secret storage was=
 locked again with another custom command.
How exactly the spy agency planned to retrieve the hidden data was unclear =
from the eight-year-old document.  Also unclear is whether the interns ever=
 produced a firmware implant that accomplished what the NSA sought.  But gi=
ven that the document includes a note that interns would be expected to pro=
duce a solution for their project within six months after assignment, and c=
onsidering the proven ingenuity of the NSA in other matters, they no doubt =
figured it out.

I (and most everyone else, as well) no longer care about booting from "hard=

So now the problem is gaining access to flash disk firmware.  Normally, you=

What I'm interested in now are completely raw flash devices having no micro=

Many of the OpenWRT router devices utilize completely raw flash devices for=
 their internal memory, which allows OpenWRT itself to choose how to manage=

I haven't checked the details on the newest Raspberry Pi device, but perhap=

Don't forget that terrorists use flush toilets -- sometimes with extra-large magazines:
"[A criminal's] most dangerous weapon is the flush toilet ... a perfect evidence-disposal system installed in every home in America"
The problem with cracking down on PlayStations to stop terrorists
If you're scared of gaming consoles, you're scared of privacy
By Russell Brandom on November 16, 2015 04:11 pm  There's a joke in the legal world that criminals' most dangerous weapon is the flush toilet.  Imagine, a perfect evidence-disposal system installed in every home in America, available whenever you hear the detectives knock on your door.  Tens thousands of potential arrests have been flushed down toilets over the years.
So why do we keep toilets around?  Well, they're useful for other things.
Today, instead of the flush toilet, we learned about the PlayStation 4.  In a now-retracted story, Forbes made the case that PlayStation's private chat and VoIP features may have been used in plotting the attacks, kicking off a wave of concerns over gaming networks and their potential use in plotting terrorist acts.
But while Forbes has since backed off the claim that a PS4 was found in an attacker's apartment, the air of suspicion hasn't fully lifted.  There really have been cases of ISIS sympathizers using the PlayStation network to communicate or recruit, and it's the kind of offbeat channel an intelligence officer might miss.  PlayStations network is open to anyone with the right console, and theres lots of noise to distract anyone who might look there.  As the UK's Investigatory Powers Bill heads to parliament, the political will to clamp down on those networks is stronger than it's ever been.  So why shouldn't we?
The first thing to say is that the PlayStation network isn't particularly secure.  It's not end-to-end encrypted, and Sony is open about the company's right to surveil users, even if it doesn't have much of an apparatus to do so.  Unlike encrypted chat apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, the PlayStation networks weren't designed with security in mind, and most users care far more about latency and downtime than they do about privacy.  If an intelligence service is looking for you specifically, it's just not that good of a place to hide.
What the networks do have is a lot of people, which makes them useful for meeting inconspicuously.  You won't stand out if you set up a private chat on PSN, the way you might if you log onto a protected chat room or IRC channel.  It's the protection of the crowd, the same way you might talk more freely in a noisy bar where you wont be overheard.  This kind of privacy is more about cultural expectations than strict security, and its particularly important because of that.  It can be used by terrorists, sure, but so can dimly lit restaurants and crowded parks.  If that's scary, then all private spaces are scary.  If you believe that logic, you've made a boogeyman out of privacy itself.
All of which brings us back to the flush toilet.  In the wake of a tragedy, shock makes us value security over all else, often forgetting smaller virtues in the rush to protect ourselves.  It's a natural impulse, but it's worth considering where it might take us, left unchecked.  With enough fear, anything comes to look threatening: a gaming console, a toilet, a smartphone.  Will destroying them make us more or less powerful?

Anyone who's watched a recent movie or TV show knows about burner phones.  They seem to have become the 21st century version of a "one time pad".
What's the most important criterion for a burner phone?  It should be *cheap*; only the most well-heeled terrorists would use an iPhone as a burner.
There's much less need to encrypt a burner phone.  In fact, one might purposely put false/misleading information onto such a phone prior to throwing it away.  (And *delete* it, just to piss off Mr. Vance, who hates cellphone software that actually deletes data when you press "delete".)
"investigators were able to access the data on the phone, including a detailed map of the concert hall and an SMS messaging saying were off; were starting.  Police were also able to trace the phones movements."
"Ironically, the suspects were overheard discussing the need to frequently swap out their cellphones."

Terry Halvorsen Orders Microsoft Windows 10 Updates on 4M DoD Seats
Posted By: Jane Edwardson: February 18, 2016
Terry Halvorsen, chief information officer of the Defense Department, has committed 4 million seats in the departments efforts to upgrade its information systems and devices to the Microsoft-built Windows 10 operating system.
Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president for Windows and devices group at Microsoft, writes in a blog entry posted Wednesday that the move aims to help DoD reduce information technology costs and improve IT processes.
Halvorsen said in a November 2015 memo that he expects the Pentagon to standardize and complete the Windows 10 OS deployment within a year in an effort to safeguard networks from cyber threats, Microsoft Federal CTO Susie Adams wrote in a separate article posted Wednesday.
Department of Defense directs DoD agencies to standardize on Windows 10
by Susie Adams, Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Federal on February 17, 2016
Its no secret that government agencies require a level of safety and security that is unmatched in the enterprise market.  Constantly evolving security threats, managing continuous updates on multiple platforms and devices, and slow upgrade cycles are just a few of the challenges facing government CIOs who are looking to standardize and secure agency baseline systems.
To help reduce this burden, according to the Office of the DoD CIO, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary of Defense has directed all DoD agencies currently on legacy operating systems to standardize on Windows 10.  With deployments starting right away, all DoD agencies must upgrade approximately 4 million devices and systems with a goal of deploying within one year.  This is an unprecedented move for the DoD and the largest enterprise deployment of Windows 10 to date.
"Why users would want their location tapped and their every keystroke logged by a corporation for their own benefit sounds quite fishy; it is only applicable for individual users."
