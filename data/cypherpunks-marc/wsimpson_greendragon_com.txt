Actually, they've already told us all we need to know:
 1) NO cryptography was used.
 2) Public library terminals were used.
 3) Free accounts were used.
 4) No suspicious international communications.
 5) None of the terrorists was a suspect before the incident.
 6) None would have been prevented from boarding an airplane.
Therefore, no amount of network monitoring would have prevented the This is just a police state power grab, trying to get facilities and laws that a democracy would never give them otherwise, sought during a time of concern.
So far, none of the "security" measures we've seen has actually prevented anything, or even been designed to prevent anything that has happened in the recent past.  Camouflaged guards in airports?
Secret searches?
All we have is an impotent executive seeking to expand its power.
What we HAVE discovered through analysis is that the two preventative measures that MIGHT have helped were cut due to bottom line costs:
 1) Secure cockpit doors.  Even now, the Administration refuses to     mandate a security standard.
 2) Immigration visa checks.  Bush I drastically cut the size of the     department, and Bush II was poised to throw open the doors.

Gosh and Golly Gee, not another "my way or the highway" despot!  I'd never have guessed that Vixie was a supporter of a police state.  I'll stop supporting democracy when they pry my vote out of my cold dead Meanwhile, where is it exactly that all ISPs should move?
Where?  The US House has adjourned.  (You might be referring to the "pre-conference" committee that met before the "conference" committee meets next week?)
It's all being done, probably illegally, by executive order.

Would this be the DHCP working group that on at least 2 occasions when I was there, insisted that secure DHCP wouldn't require a secret, since DHCP isn't supposed to require "configuration"?
And all I was proposing at the time was username, challenge, MD5-hash
response (very CHAP-like).  They can configure ARP addresses for "security", but having both the user and administrator configure a per
host secret was apparently out of the question.
