You have to be careful in the media management dialogue that you add the correct type of source. You probably clicked the "ftp source" or "local" button when what you need is an http source. You also have to fill the correct information in the correct lines of the dialogue. eslrahc goes in the "name" line,  goes on the URL line, click the radio button on the line that says something like "Relative Path to synthesis or hdlist" and only enter >hdlist.cz<.
You could always do things the easy way, as explained below.
Open a terminal (konsole), type su and strike the Enter key, provide the root password when prompted and paste the entire line from Charles' site then strike Enter again.
This is the line from Charles' site for Mandrake 10.0. Everything between the brackets of course.
That should take care of it for you.
