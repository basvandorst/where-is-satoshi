Just for their (and your) information: the maximum possible penality
for non-compliance is 500,000 EUR plus the fees of the law suit.
I really appreciate Tor and I also appreciate people to stand up for
Tor. But keeping Tor running without logging after January 1st and not
being filthy rich *and* having having a tons of lawyers in your kitchen
will IMHO be similar to suicide.
There got to be another alternative - and I don't refer to logging.

I strongly agree on this one: Tor's strength is to provide security even in
the face of compromised hosts. Any solution which tries to distinct hosts in
"logging territory" and "non-logging territory" is inherently flawed (it
simply doesn't scale: sooner or later there will be no more nodes with
GUARD-flags). After all, onion routing was invented to deal with untrustworthy
nodes. All we would have to do is to extend the security "calculations" by
admitting that a node is not only influenced by its operator, but also a
country's government. (so, e.g. if all people within the same country would
also just put their nodes into the "family"-field, this would be a first
(ugly) fix. but this also doesn't scale, as it's only a theoretical concept)
Also, it should be brought into mind that this problem will not only be a
German one, but rather a European. Hence, IMHO, solutions like picking nodes
in a circuit based on country/jurisdiction would be a better approach[1].
