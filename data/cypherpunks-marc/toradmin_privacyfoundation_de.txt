No problem or freaks. But many users are happy, they know and
understand Tor (more or less). How to teach all of them an
alternative? We do not only provide the onion network for freaks. Keep
the users in mind.

Yes, correct. It was may opinion, to wrote about this point of view.
My own point of view may be useless for the tor developer, if they
were looking for a solution.

@_subject: German data rentention law 
I. part: A short overview about the data rentention law in Germany.
  1: ISPs have to log the start and end of a user dial-in with
     time stamp and IP address. They have not to log any content.
  2: Public provider of electronic mail have to log all connections of
     users with time stamp, IP address, login account and the email
     addresses of sender and recipient for every mail (send and
     receive).
  3: VoIP provider have to log all connections with timestamp,
     IP address and phone number of caller and recipient.
  4: Fon and mobile fon provider have to log all connections and
     tries with timestamp, phone number and location.
  5: Anon services have to log the rewrite of any information, which
     will be logged by a third party. (Thats all, not very clear.)
At the moment, it seems not clear, how tor is affected by this law.
I read some papers from the gouverment: "An anon service (like tor or
JAP) has to log, because the law will be useless otherwise."
Some papers of non-gouverment organizations like ULD: "Tor and JAP are
not affected by the telecommunication law, because it is not a
telecommunication service (in the case of law) and tor nodes have NOT
to log."
Together with the JonDos GmbH (JAP) the GPF try to get a legal
non-logging solution for tor, but the result is open and we are late.
(May be too late?)
II. part: suggestion of a technical solution
May be, tor can use geoip and divide the world in a logging area and a
non-logging area. If the target host is inside the logging area
(Germany), the exit node has to be outside. Otherwise a german node
can be an exit too.
In this case, we have two possibilities:
  1: the target host is outside the logging area -> no logging
  2: the target host is inside the logging area -> the exit is
     outside and writes no logs -> an german entry or middle man
     has to log nothing, because it routes to a not logging exit.
Because not all clients will update to a new version very quickly,
we need a feature for german exit nodes to reject all routes from old
clients, when the node is the exit of the route.
Or, if it was more simple for the developer, a feature for exit nodes
to define a country (based on geoip) to reject all exit routes. If all
german relays used this feature, it may work.
Otherwise, all german nodes have to switch to middle man.
It is only one suggestion, not the really best solution.

The article by Patrick Breyer and the translation by Seth Schoen gives
the information about one main reason, why Tor nodes are not affected
by the EU data retention an the German data retention law Â§113a TKG.
Supported by qualified lawyers, we have identified one or two more
points, why tor nodes has to be data retention free, but these points
are technical and more difficult to communicate with the judiciary.
So we ask the tor community, to keep tor non-commercial at all. If a
commercial version of tor was online, it will be much more difficult
in the next time, to fight against data retention in EU.
Yes, it is possible, to make a data retention law for donated services
in EU too. But this will takes time. We can use this time, to make tor
more robust against this attack.
We will keep the German tor admins and the board of torproject.org
up-to-date about the lawyers expert opinion but with respect to the
recommendation of the lawyers, we will not publish it at the moment.

I saw coloured revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kirgisia. After
successfull revolution these countries got corrupt regimes. I hope,
iran will not go this way.
And I hope, tor will stay political neutral.

May be, it is more easy to use the Tor hidden services in a way like
TorChat and add a higher lever service for asynchronous messaging?
