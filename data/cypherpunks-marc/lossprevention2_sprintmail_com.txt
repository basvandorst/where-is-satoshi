 With CHEXpedite Electronic Check Recovery, whenever you have
 a bounced check, we can bypass conventional methods by converting it to an electronic item.
 We do this using a very unique proprietary software program  which electronically transmits the item to the Automated Clearing  House (ACH) like an email.  Electronic items always take priority
 over paper checks, so your checks get priority.
 This is an automated electronic process that deducts the money
 from the check bouncer's account.  The recovered funds are paid
 to you twice a month.  This completely eliminates the annoying
 30-60 day process of most collection agencies, if you ever see
 the money at all!  Best of all, the collection is absolutely Free
 to you.
