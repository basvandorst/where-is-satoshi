@_subject: Re:  [MailServer Notification]To Sender virus found and action 
Please, people.  Turn this "feature" off!  With today's spoofing
viruses, it serves no useful purpose to send these notifications
(usually to the wrong address) and only doubles or triples the amount of
wasted emails.
Thank you to all who already have.  Now if we could just get Symantec
et. al. to delete this feature...
