I had a debate with my poli-sci prof, too. I asked her, specifically, about
anarchic institutions and the role of government. After a preamble about
there being nothing to discuss if there weren't any government, she
replied something like, "The role of government is to plot a vector
towards the unobtainable, in hopes that people will reach for it. Bad
regimes will throw lines at horror. Good ones throw them at the stars.
If a set of people with the reins of power steer things the wrong way,
it is indeed the duty of those governed to set them right."
I am sure I misquoted her, so I am not including her name. On another note, I just rejoined the CP list after a rather long
hiatus. I hope people will be just as abusive as when I left before.

Pardon, you're so right.
Now that I reflect on it, I am positive that the free voting, free
dealing citizens who democratically elected Perves Musharraf,
Robert Mugabe, Kim Jong-Il and Mullah Omar to wisely govern
their free market economies feel they owe a great deal to dear
Mr. Reagan. Almost as much as I feel towards our own democratically elected (7 to 2) Curious George.

That would be the term that he became more and more
comparable to Zippy the Pinhead.
So, in your world, Latin America, all of Africa, most of the
Middle east and just about all of the far east are safe for
democracy and capitalism? Never mind the clampdown
on even internal trade we're seeing in this extremely freedom loving country. Or don't you know anyone who
actually distributes, well, just about anything for trade?
Reagan did some things I approve of, but I do wonder how any
sane person can assert he wasn't well on his way to becoming
a vegetable during the second term.* I only hope that baby-Bush
has advisors good enough to keep him, in the prime of his life, from
making the mistakes his former antecedents made in their
* Many say that Reagan caused the fall of the Berlin Wall,
the opening of Russia, etc. I am not sure I agree that his
policies caused it - I do think they probably shoved a starving
man off a cliff.
I believe that he and Daddy Bush lost a fine geopolitical
coup when they didn't offer "compassionate colonization" to
the emergent Russian nation state. The IMF and WTO are only
political instruments when the U.S. feels threatened, and because
of that it lost the biggest strategic thrust since Germany attacked
the USSR. The current disastrous counterattack is simply moving
more slowly.

Kook. Reminds me a little of Ray Kurzweil; looks like there are
interesting thoughts bouncing around there, but then you
run in to him trying to flirt with a speech synthesizer on stage.
(I'm not kidding; I can't find a link now, but it happened at
the TED conference last year. A similarly embarrassing
thing fills half of _The Age of Spiritual Machines_.)

(Humor ahead)
"We are above the law", a senior official states. "Most other
nations have noticed that the U.S. defines the rules other states
need to play by, but we do not and have not ever tried to give
the impression that we will observe those rules."
Meanwhile, the negotiations surrounding the torture of
suspected innocents continues.

The country of Antigua trusts in the morals and discretion of all the
citizens who choose to do business there. We understand that it
is difficult to allow legal council to review all correspondence for possible collision with any given regime around the globe. At the
same time, however, we must ask you to please limit your conversations
in a way that makes less interesting your business operations. Thank you.

Oops. Sorry about that. While I'm sure the entire world really was
interested in my plans for that weekend, I didn't mean to reply
to the list.

I'm around, and would like to be there. Nothing really to speak
