my point is, there is this 'middle' space where it's hard to justify spending money on something that isn't used.  Of course it's easy to view as "insurance" and easier to justify *after* an attack (or loss).  it is hard to proactively justify this type of expense.  If for every 10g of capacity, you had a 40k/year "Security" surcharge, at what point do you factor this in as part of your regular bandwidth costs vs the current "down and to the right" pricing trend.
Delivering these services is something I have observed it is difficult to ask someone to pay for unless they have experience with it.  Most are willing to start off with the "self-insure" premise until it is too much to bear, then immediately they are willing to pay 'something' to allow capital cost recovery.
I am talking about those purporting to offer ddos solution hardware either past, present or future.
If it's 2010 or 2011 and you experience flow-control like issues with your CLI interface, either slow interactive response or garbled processing (over telnet/ssh) there is something not quite right IMHO.  Then again, I'm known for being a bit of an odd character.

Or just buy a gig-e from cogent at 3$/meg/mo (or is it $4 this month?) to burn for ddos.
The problem I've found is that some of the vendors of ddos gear still have significant problems they are working to address.  The Cisco (riverhead) guard would have a 1 second delay (for example) for each configuration line one would add.  If you dealt with a wildcard rule, it would be 1 second per underlying rule to make the configuration change.
The ability to 'paste' something in to a device and have a predictable output seemed to be too high of a bar for them to solve, this could be one of the reasons the product went to the wayside.
I'm also not sure that anyone else is much better in this regard.
Of course everyone is willing to sell you a seven-figure "solution" for your problems, but once you actually start talking about the usability, ease of provisioning, and the customer education about the caveats most people start to glaze quickly.
Even with the right gear, technology, etc.. the vendors don't make it easy to deliver these solutions.
