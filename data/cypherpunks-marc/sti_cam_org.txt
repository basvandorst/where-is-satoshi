@_subject: Partition Encryptor 
Does anyone know of a good partition encryptor for Windows? I know of an accountant who would like to encrypt her client's financial data. She's stuck with Windows until such time as a major company starts shipping yearly tax software for linux.
Something like PGPdisk, only open source, would be best.
