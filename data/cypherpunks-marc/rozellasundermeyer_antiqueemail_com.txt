T N A pipe burst in a lawyer's house, so he called a plumber.  The plumber
arrived, unpacked his tools, did mysterious plumber-type things for a while,
and handed the lawyer a bill for $600.The lawyer exclaimed, "This is
ridiculous! I don't even make that much as a lawyer!."The plumber quietly
replied, "Neither did I when I was a lawyer."
A barber gave a haircut to a priest one day. The priest tried to pay for
the haircut but the barber refused saying, "You do God's work." The next
morning the barber found a dozen bibles at the door to his shop.A policeman
came to the barber for a haircut, and again the barber refused payment
saying, "You protect the public." The next morning the barber found a dozen
doughnuts at the door to his shop.A lawyer came to the barber for a haircut,
and again the barber refused payment saying, "You serve the justice system."
The next morning the barber found a dozen lawyers waiting for a haircut.
