@_subject: Re: Doing HTTPS everywhere in the .gov space 
Interesting conjectures! But... What do they have to do with https everywhere that Eric mentioned? They're very general thoughts. And even if we only have 5 years, why not enforce https on .gov sites until then? Seems like a win to me, no matter how long government survives.
