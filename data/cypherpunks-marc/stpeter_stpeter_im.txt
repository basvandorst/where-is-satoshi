Although presumably there would be value in shutting down a
privacy-protecting service just so that people can't benefit from it any
longer. When the assumption is that everything must be public, any
service that keeps some information non-public might be perceived as a
Sure, that problem is well-known by now. :-/ However, I'm not convinced
that email providers have been shut down (or have done so proactively)
only because they send around To and From addresses.

How so? Centralization via commercial operators doesn't seem to have
helped in the email space lately.

You mean something like this (email address --> OTR key)?

A thousand times yes.
One doesn't need to communicate with several billion people, and we
don't need systems that scale up that high. Most folks just want to
interact (chat, share photos, voice/video conference, etc.) with their
friends and family and colleagues -- maybe 50 - 500 people. IMHO we
only need to scale up that high for secure communication. (I'm talking
about individual communication, not enterprise stuff.)
What about talking with someone new? Well, we can design separate
protocols that enable you to be introduced to someone you haven't
communicated with before (we already do that with things like FOAF,
LinkedIn, Facebook). Part of that introduction might involve learning
the new person's public key from someone you already trust (no need
for Internet-scale certificate authorities). You could use that public
key for bootstrapping the pairwise shared secrets.
Another attractive aspect of a network of friends is that it can be
used for mix networking (route messages through your friends) and for
things like less-than-completely-public media relays and data proxies
for voice, video, file transfer, etc. And such relays might just live
on those little home devices that Perry is talking about, separate
from the cloud.

By 'hosts' do you mean do you mean servers, or also endpoints? If the
latter, I see interesting possibilities for a "network of friends"
system of the kind Perry sketched out here a month or two ago.
