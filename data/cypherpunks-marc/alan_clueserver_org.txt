I just wonder how many security professionals will be willing to work with them now that they are planning on making "hacking" a crime with a life sentence and no statute of limitations?  (Especially since they have a habit of finding some reason to jail them when they are not longer useful.)
"Terrorist" seems to have been redefined to mean "anyone who can inconvenience the Government, no matter how slight".

A more appropreate lyric for the situation...
From "Duck Soup"
These are the laws of my administration
No one's allowed to smoke
Or tell a dirty joke
And whistling is forbidden...
If chewing gum is chewed
The chewer is pursued.
And in the hoosegow hidden...
If any form of pleasure is exhibited
Report to me and it will be prohibited.
I'll put my foot down, so shall it be.
This is the land of the free.
The last man nearly ruined this place
He didn't know what to do with it
If you think this country's bad off now
Just wait 'til I get through with it
The country's taxes must be fixed
And I know what to do with it
If you think you're paying too much now
Just wait 'til I get through with it...
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair
I'm strictly on the up and up
So everyone beware
If anyone's caught taking graft
And I don't get my share
We stand 'em up against the wall
And pop goes the weasel.
If any man should come between his husband and his bride
We find out which one she prefers
By letting her decide
If she prefers the other man
The husband steps outside
We stand 'em up against the wall
And pop goes the weasel.

The current administration keeps waffling on if this is a war or not.
When it suits their purposes (getting money out of congress, censoring the press, and trampling on the constitution and bill of rights) it is a War.  When it does not suit their purposes (like how they treat prisoners), it is not a War.

Oregon has a high percentage of high-tech companies that are owned by out of state entities.  (For some weird reason, they think that they have to have a Silicon Valley address or they will not be thought of as "special".)
Before this stupidity started, most business between such offices was done by hopping on a plane every couple of days. Now that is less than practical.
I know at least one person who has lost her job due to the office being shut down because it was just too much hassle having a satelite office in Oregon.
Intel got around the previous rules by having private jets. I have not heard if they have had to follow the same silly restrictions since the "Sept 11th excuse". (I have not been back to San Jose since last August, which is fine by me since it is one of the most BORING places I have ever been. It needs a large band that says "Sanitized for your protection" wrapped around the city.)

Bullshit.  If you don't want SSL going through the firewall, then block port 443.  Otherwise keep your nose out of conversations that do not involve you.
And as a "national resourse" they will get clear-cut at the first opertunity.
Any why do they not already know this???

Bullshit again. If you can abuse it, you will. If you won't, someone else Besides. SSL is resistant to "man-in-the-middle attacks" just like you are Instead of letting your little brats run loose on the net, or trying to dumb things down to make it "safe" for them, why not teach them how to handle it.
Childhood is a time to prepare children for adulthood.  it is not a mystical playtime where they are to be protected in some sort of foam-padded wrapping and kept from all bad influences.
The reason that there are fucked up people out there is because people like you fucked them up while they were young.  You did not teach them the lessons they needed and instilled fear, uncertainty and a god-instilled fear of their own biology.
If you are that paniced about the situation, you need to do a couple of 1) Get a grip.
2) Find a nice decaf coffee.
3) Get another job. Such paranoia will not help your students. It will only make them (rightfully) mistrust you and work harder to go behind your back. That I seriously doubt... Ohterwise you would not be posting here through an anonymous account.
Children need to be taught that they don't meet people they don't know without others there to help them out in case they are whackos.  (Actually such a plan is good at any age.) If they don't know that by fifteen, then you have failed in their education and should find some other line of work, as well as not breed yourself.

Not really.  It depends on what they are exploiting.  Does every piece of code need to be validated all the time? Once a program is running, does something running in its code space get revalidated or soes it just run?
I don't see how paladium stops buffer overflows or heap exploits or format bugs or any of the standard exploits that are in use today.  (Not without crippling the entire system for bot the user and the programmer.)
It seems to change little for script kiddies if the machines are going to communicate with other systems.  (Unless the DRM holders will control who and how you can connect as well.  And they just might do that as well...)
The perveyors of this also claim it will stop spam and e-mail viruses. They only way it can do that is by making paladium based systems incompatable with every non-DRM machine on the planet.  (So much for getting e-mail from your relatives!)
The only problem this hardware seems to solve is shackling the user into what data they can see and use.  If Microsoft follows their standard coding practices, the script kiddie problem will not go away with this technology. It will probably increase.  And it will be illegal to effectivly stop them.

Furthermore, people have come to expect that they should be able to play whatever disc shaped media in their computer.  At some point there will need to be a software based player.
But the real issue is that all of these DRM methods rely on "security by obscurity".  Such methods eventually fail.  Either the actual method is discovered and published or the DRM method fails in the marketplace and is never heard from again.
