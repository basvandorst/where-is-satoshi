Dear sir,
I am pleased to introduce to you a business opportunity to transfer to your oversea account the
sum of $4.4Million USD( Four million four hundred thousand dollar) from one of the prime banks in Europe.
I am Mr ALI BELLO(Bsc,Msc)The managing director of international money remittance department of Bank of Africa here in Senegal. On 21st April 2002, I surpervised a wire transfer of the US$4.4Million through our Bank to a prime Bank in Europe belonging to a foreigner. Engr.Taha Ibrahim, Who used to work as an Esate Consultant here in Senegal before his death on the 17th of June 2002, After a brief illness of a respiratory problem (Asthma).
The Bank at which the deceased made the transfer has issued a note of enquiries concerning the fund beneficiary as it is against the Banking Ethics for an account to be left unserviced for a period of five years.
I am contacting you to assist in repartrating the money since the account has no Next of kin and Nobody is putting a claim on it before they got it confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank as an unclaimed bill.There is nothing that will stop the Bank from approving the payment to a foreigner who has the correct information of the fund and the deceased, which i shall forward to you upon your positive response and once i'm convinced of your capability and assurance that you will not let me down.
I look forward to your earliest response.
Best regards
Mr ALI BELLO
