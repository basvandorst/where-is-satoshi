Here's my client-mode implementation so far.  Client-only mode only
records block headers and doesn't use the tx index.  It can't generate, but
it can still send and receive transactions.  It's not fully finished for
use by end-users, but it doesn't matter because it's a complete no-op if
fClient is not enabled.  At this point it's mainly documentation showing
the cut-lines for client-only re-implementers.
With fClient=true, I've only tested the header-only initial download.
A little background.  CBlockIndex contains all the information of the block
header, so to operate with headers only, I just maintain the CBlockIndex
structure as usual.  The nFile/nBlockPos are null, since the full block is
not recorded on disk.
The code to gracefully switch between client-mode on/off without deleting
blk*.dat in between is not implemented yet.  It would mostly be a matter of
having non-client LoadBlockIndex ignore block index entries with null block
pos.  That would make it re-download those as full blocks.  Switching back
to client-mode is no problem, it doesn't mind if the full blocks are there.
If the initial block download becomes too long, we'll want client mode as
an option so new users can get running quickly.  With graceful switch-off
of client mode, they can later turn off client mode and have it download
the full blocks if they want to start generating.  They should rather just
use a getwork miner to join a pool instead.
Client-only re-implementations would not need to implement EvalScript at
all, or at most just implement the five ops used by the standard
transaction templates.
