67 - it would be
40 - be able to
37 - a lot of
27 - version 0 3
24 - i'm not sure
23 - that would be
23 - i don't know
22 - to make sure
22 - to do it
22 - initial block download
21 - would have to
21 - the block chain
20 - one of the
20 - would be a
20 - to make it
20 - it should be
20 - a way to
19 - we need to
19 - if you want
18 - would be nice
18 - need to be
18 - the number of
18 - wxwidgets 2 9
18 - 2 9 0
18 - as long as
18 - if you have
17 - a bitcoin address
17 - going to be
17 - it can be
17 - to connect to
17 - you want to
16 - if you can
16 - this is a
16 - so you can
16 - have to be
15 - back to the
15 - to make a
15 - if you don't
15 - i don't think
15 - 0 3 13
15 - don't want to
15 - the status bar
15 - do you think
15 - the initial block
15 - 0 3 1
14 - the rest of
14 - it to the
14 - the next block
14 - to be a
14 - you can get
14 - to 0 3
14 - in svn rev
14 - you have to
14 - most of the
14 - way to do
13 - the public key
13 - in the future
13 - to have a
13 - at the same
13 - the same time
13 - 0 3 10
13 - 0 3 6
12 - on the network
12 - the 0 3
12 - the command line
12 - there was a
12 - for a while
12 - i need to
12 - needs to be
12 - a good idea
12 - it looks like
12 - at the time
12 - a long time
12 - receive incoming connections
12 - the network is
12 - the startup folder
12 - 127 0 0
12 - 0 0 1
12 - version 0 2
11 - in the next
11 - the transaction fee
11 - to get the
11 - it must be
11 - at a time
11 - the first time
11 - the linux version
11 - you need to
11 - to the network
11 - to set up
10 - in the main
10 - if there's a
10 - so it can
10 - part of the
10 - it would have
10 - you can use
10 - the size of
10 - bitcoin address and
10 - that's a good
10 - if there was
10 - would be to
10 - it has to
10 - and see if
10 - this is the
10 - can only be
10 - it could be
10 - based on the
10 - let me know
10 - at least one
10 - of the network
10 - 0 3 0
10 - to keep the
10 - i want to
10 - accept incoming connections
10 - it would only
10 - trusted third party
10 - www bitcoin org
9 - version of the
9 - to send to
9 - rest of the
9 - to the same
9 - into a block
9 - to make the
9 - of the block
9 - size of the
9 - at the moment
9 - there would be
9 - to a bitcoin
9 - want to use
9 - if it was
9 - is now available
9 - the next release
9 - the only way
9 - to use it
9 - don't have to
9 - is a good
9 - be used for
9 - a new address
9 - do you have
9 - wxwidgets 2 8
9 - to do a
9 - upgrade to 0
9 - it is possible
9 - a hash of
9 - to check for
9 - the cost of
9 - to run a
9 - 0 3 3
9 - not going to
9 - can accept incoming
9 - connect to the
9 - a number of
9 - 000 coins next
9 - coins next 4
9 - next 4 years
8 - the main chain
8 - to the next
8 - so it doesn't
8 - in that case
8 - in 0 3
8 - i think it
8 - would be very
8 - to try to
8 - bitcoin is a
8 - the linux build
8 - 0 1 5
8 - only way to
8 - if it's not
8 - i wanted to
8 - as soon as
8 - has to be
8 - the bitcoin address
8 - it if you
8 - if you were
8 - you have a
8 - sending by ip
8 - would still be
8 - on the forum
8 - i think the
8 - will be able
8 - still have to
8 - figure out how
8 - out how to
8 - blk dat files
8 - the bad chain
8 - it as a
8 - you don't have
8 - blocks per hour
8 - is in the
8 - of the world
8 - it might be
8 - run a node
8 - i wonder if
8 - what do you
8 - to get a
8 - the proof-of-work difficulty
8 - there is a
8 - 21 million coins
8 - the transaction to
8 - public key of
8 - http www bitcoin
7 - make sure the
7 - what it is
7 - if it has
7 - the network and
7 - for it to
7 - to generate a
7 - it with the
7 - would be possible
7 - be hard to
7 - there will be
7 - tcatm's 4-way sse2
7 - able to get
7 - there's no way
7 - have to do
7 - to work on
7 - to be able
7 - that can be
7 - doesn't have to
7 - don't know if
7 - to look at
7 - in debug log
7 - had time to
7 - good idea to
7 - that was the
7 - would not be
7 - for a long
7 - there is no
7 - number of blocks
7 - to use a
7 - can get a
7 - one of them
7 - the problem is
7 - hash of the
7 - to worry about
7 - an order of
7 - order of magnitude
7 - that if you
7 - a new bitcoin
7 - new bitcoin address
7 - for a trusted
7 - is going to
7 - a static ip
7 - check for double-spending
7 - a peer-to-peer network
7 - bitcoin sourceforge net
6 - is designed to
6 - in a block
6 - don't know what
6 - the same key
6 - of a transaction
6 - it back to
6 - the first transaction
6 - in the block
6 - the longest chain
6 - that if the
6 - still need to
6 - would have been
6 - in the world
6 - the first spend
6 - not a big
6 - a big deal
6 - think it would
6 - if there are
6 - if you get
6 - not sure what
6 - i can't think
6 - can't think of
6 - be very easy
6 - been working on
6 - only need to
6 - at any time
6 - it on the
6 - at some point
6 - it seems like
6 - it's going to
6 - is not a
6 - to get it
6 - so if you
6 - to do this
6 - be nice to
6 - i had to
6 - is the only
6 - that's the only
6 - it does not
6 - to get into
6 - need to get
6 - the end of
6 - your debug log
6 - delete blk dat
6 - make sure it
6 - i have to
6 - i made the
6 - so it would
6 - how long did
6 - can be spent
6 - change it to
6 - in the first
6 - with the network
6 - for 0 3
6 - to think of
6 - and make sure
6 - to a new
6 - don't have a
6 - we need a
6 - but it would
6 - is there a
6 - i think i
6 - you'd have to
6 - by bitcoin address
6 - what to do
6 - haven't had time
6 - you still have
6 - to keep it
6 - the alert system
6 - on the status
6 - in response to
6 - can use the
6 - that could be
6 - will be a
6 - to verify the
6 - a copy of
6 - all the blocks
6 - in the status
6 - think of it
6 - a lot more
6 - 6 blocks per
6 - you're connected to
6 - i don't have
6 - 3 4 5
6 - if i can
6 - a transaction fee
6 - it doesn't have
6 - at least the
6 - if you could
6 - be a good
6 - this would be
6 - out of it
6 - but i think
6 - doesn't have a
6 - the cpu power
6 - all the time
6 - we don't have
6 - file sharing networks
6 - it that way
6 - a few hours
6 - i guess we
6 - to do the
6 - to fix it
6 - on the same
6 - able to reproduce
6 - it would still
6 - way to make
6 - how to do
6 - i think we
6 - at the beginning
6 - with a new
6 - in the startup
6 - a way for
6 - there are a
6 - connected to the
6 - the need for
6 - the debug log
6 - in the middle
6 - would be great
6 - if you had
6 - to see the
6 - of the next
6 - and we need
6 - the owner of
6 - the ip address
6 - your bitcoin address
6 - in order to
6 - with each other
6 - if you send
6 - which is a
6 - is possible to
6 - online at the
6 - solution is to
6 - you can enter
6 - new public key
6 - key of the
6 - 0 1 3
6 - can't receive incoming
6 - send me the
6 - look at the
6 - if the recipient
6 - the recipient is
5 - the first block
5 - proof of work
5 - to other nodes
5 - giving the same
5 - to start with
5 - public key that
5 - a bunch of
5 - the block is
5 - to be the
5 - number of connections
5 - a list of
5 - 0 3 9
5 - it for the
5 - don't need to
5 - in the chain
5 - with the same
5 - would need to
5 - be possible for
5 - now that we
5 - that we have
5 - the right way
5 - an option to
5 - to do that
5 - from the command
5 - have to make
5 - very easy to
5 - if you use
5 - go back to
5 - try to use
5 - it's supposed to
5 - it can't be
5 - the data is
5 - was able to
5 - every 10 minutes
5 - the latest block
5 - the one that
5 - to svn rev
5 - is the same
5 - soon as possible
5 - transactions per block
5 - a problem with
5 - if you're using
5 - have at least
5 - if the transaction
5 - thank you for
5 - the only thing
5 - to see if
5 - there are other
5 - a lot easier
5 - would be an
5 - to delete blk
5 - may not be
5 - i made a
5 - the po file
5 - it takes a
5 - a bitcoin payment
5 - it i don't
5 - to get connected
5 - i uploaded the
5 - by the time
5 - the time it
5 - make sure you
5 - are you using
5 - if you didn't
5 - to the block
5 - then you have
5 - you can accept
5 - if you haven't
5 - me know if
5 - know if it
5 - if it gets
5 - if you do
5 - think it should
5 - thing to do
5 - uploaded to svn
5 - by ip address
5 - bitcoin would be
5 - to be open
5 - that makes it
5 - be nice if
5 - not sure how
5 - is in svn
5 - 0 3 11
5 - the amount of
5 - to change it
5 - other nodes if
5 - the first post
5 - can also be
5 - there are so
5 - are so many
5 - i added the
5 - can do is
5 - can figure out
5 - if there is
5 - on the cryptography
5 - to the new
5 - in the transaction
5 - i'd like to
5 - blocks in the
5 - would probably be
5 - that for a
5 - you don't want
5 - it would help
5 - to get some
5 - a small amount
5 - see if i
5 - i think that's
5 - there's no reason
5 - if it's a
5 - if the network
5 - it and it
5 - is the first
5 - not need to
5 - the option to
5 - a chain of
5 - 0 3 8
5 - in version 0
5 - be a problem
5 - have to worry
5 - that the transaction
5 - message in the
5 - to support the
5 - the next time
5 - think we should
5 - is limited to
5 - the first one
5 - the bitcoin org
5 - chance of finding
5 - 0 3 2
5 - 0 2 0
5 - if it doesn't
5 - able to make
5 - we can use
5 - how it works
5 - or at least
5 - but it is
5 - the transaction is
5 - on bitcoin org
5 - cpu power they
5 - on the homepage
5 - it with a
5 - a little while
5 - a new hash
5 - a link to
5 - and you can
5 - the svn version
5 - who wants to
5 - it wouldn't be
5 - to put a
5 - appdata bitcoin directory
5 - to replace the
5 - need for a
5 - a trusted central
5 - total circulation is
5 - to find out
5 - port 8333 on
5 - if there's any
5 - version 0 1
5 - i don't see
5 - have to trust
5 - the same way
5 - directly to the
5 - the time the
5 - incoming connections and
5 - connect through tor
5 - bitcoin proxy 127
5 - proxy 127 0
5 - 0 1 9050
5 - you send to
5 - it and the
5 - on the transaction
5 - be online at
5 - multi-processor support for
5 - support for coin
5 - for coin generation
5 - coin generation proxy
5 - generation proxy support
5 - new liberty standard
5 - there are two
5 - a command line
5 - backup the whole
5 - in the background
5 - that can accept
5 - not be accepted
5 - working on the
5 - for people to
5 - they're willing to
5 - read the message
5 - a new public
5 - could you send
5 - it is a
5 - to backup the
5 - and there's no
5 - for users to
5 - of cpu power
5 - without a trusted
5 - a trusted third
5 - the ability to
5 - completely decentralized with
5 - decentralized with no
5 - server or trusted
5 - or trusted parties
5 - at http www
5 - network to check
5 - circulation will be
5 - will be 21
5 - be 21 000
5 - 21 000 000
5 - 000 000 coins
5 - i guess it
5 - before they can
5 - the honest chain
4 - to the other
4 - the other nodes
4 - at that time
4 - of the same
4 - to the first
4 - block in the
4 - it doesn't know
4 - we want to
4 - of the chain
4 - in the last
4 - a chance to
4 - keep giving the
4 - for the same
4 - the same as
4 - of the previous
4 - inputs and outputs
4 - a transaction with
4 - the version number
4 - them into a
4 - the block's hash
4 - added to the
4 - the genesis block
4 - have the same
4 - it is the
4 - it may be
4 - ip address and
4 - more work to
4 - the software is
4 - if you need
4 - can still be
4 - be in the
4 - will be much
4 - can be used
4 - it's easy to
4 - the new transaction
4 - the old one
4 - in the wallet
4 - to be some
4 - into the transaction
4 - the transaction pool
4 - is to make
4 - is there any
4 - just be a
4 - a matter of
4 - in build-unix txt
4 - long as the
4 - think of a
4 - the hash of
4 - this way the
4 - to be used
4 - how do you
4 - listed in the
4 - to use bitcoin
4 - you could run
4 - could run it
4 - per block i
4 - of bitcoin is
4 - you're trying to
4 - way for the
4 - the advantage that
4 - from the same
4 - a block is
4 - create an account
4 - an account on
4 - i was able
4 - it to work
4 - it on a
4 - then it must
4 - blk0001 dat and
4 - dat and blkindex
4 - and blkindex dat
4 - see if there's
4 - then we can
4 - had to do
4 - will be in
4 - no way to
4 - data and hash1
4 - want to add
4 - and the rest
4 - will have to
4 - to wait for
4 - be used to
4 - paytxfee 0 01
4 - get into the
4 - later i don't
4 - the order of
4 - i think it's
4 - only thing i
4 - can think of
4 - debug log file
4 - i have the
4 - you could do
4 - to see it
4 - should be a
4 - to the bitcoin
4 - should not be
4 - with the bitcoin
4 - is just a
4 - and let it
4 - in the same
4 - wait for the
4 - long did it
4 - did it take
4 - to use the
4 - more of a
4 - should be able
4 - you still need
4 - update from sources
4 - you run it
4 - that don't have
4 - the src directory
4 - there may be
4 - in your wallet
4 - in case you
4 - even if you
4 - if you find
4 - generate a block
4 - you'd like to
4 - debug log and
4 - you can still
4 - the case where
4 - the next version
4 - to do is
4 - should have a
4 - a few things
4 - until they have
4 - the json-rpc interface
4 - a 0 3
4 - you have any
4 - profit motive for
4 - the money is
4 - the system clock
4 - by more than
4 - than an hour
4 - i'm going to
4 - only a few
4 - only have to
4 - go to the
4 - recipient is not
4 - any of the
4 - 4 5 0
4 - 4 4 1
4 - on linux is
4 - need to keep
4 - 01 transaction fee
4 - a 0 01
4 - is the number
4 - to do with
4 - not sure if
4 - is the best
4 - i haven't had
4 - we don't need
4 - it's a good
4 - it's not a
4 - nodes if you
4 - need to change
4 - it so you
4 - of the system
4 - if it works
4 - all the way
4 - in addition to
4 - i updated the
4 - more than one
4 - your clock is
4 - this is an
4 - it could get
4 - 2 8 and
4 - maybe we should
4 - there's a way
4 - i changed the
4 - return an error
4 - not be able
4 - but i didn't
4 - know what the
4 - you don't need
4 - number of confirmations
4 - could use a
4 - the 4way switch
4 - your blk dat
4 - to do all
4 - just a few
4 - no way for
4 - of it as
4 - i haven't tested
4 - it would probably
4 - you can just
4 - the same thing
4 - make sure to

4 - the problem with
4 - behind the scenes
4 - the bitcoin addresses
4 - to include a
4 - of the transactions
4 - two ways to
4 - at this point
4 - in this case
4 - their own money
4 - some of the
4 - to the recipient
4 - the fact that
4 - a majority of
4 - they want to
4 - you pay for
4 - to know that
4 - the need to
4 - the absence of
4 - of all transactions
4 - the signatures to
4 - it's hard to
4 - a good point
4 - i'll change it
4 - on the linux
4 - to take the
4 - for instance if
4 - have time to
4 - can see that
4 - to steal it
4 - an average of
4 - a node that
4 - going to have
4 - know a way
4 - for each transaction
4 - is to use
4 - if you only
4 - or you could
4 - will eventually be
4 - the file sharing
4 - we have to
4 - i don't want
4 - ubuntu 10 04
4 - do it that
4 - with version 0
4 - please upgrade to
4 - if you can't

4 - release of bitcoin
4 - electronic cash system
3 - after the first

3 - will only be
3 - newer version of

3 - the caller has
3 - caller has in
3 - has in the

3 - the same ip
3 - until they use
3 - they use it
3 - if we had
3 - a transaction it
3 - contains the public
3 - used as a
3 - a transaction can
3 - to the timechain
3 - new transactions into
3 - transactions into a

3 - it doesn't get
3 - to each other
3 - the same class
3 - the class c
3 - may be able
3 - ip in the
3 - as we can
3 - there's more work
3 - to do on
3 - and i have
3 - you need it
3 - safe mode alerts
3 - goes to the
3 - a certain amount
3 - amount of work
3 - that way the
3 - there's already a
3 - the money from
3 - bitcoin and bitdns
3 - one or the
3 - or the other
3 - far in the
3 - the possibility to
3 - transaction fee is
3 - to put it
3 - it into a
3 - make it so
3 - to get started
3 - if this is
3 - where you can
3 - we have the
3 - would be hard
3 - everyone would have
3 - can be added
3 - there's no point
3 - within a few
3 - a few days
3 - getting ready to
3 - the same address
3 - this release is
3 - to use listtransactions
3 - be replaced by
3 - to work in
3 - you use the
3 - need to see
3 - that it can
3 - next time i
3 - time i update
3 - the block index
3 - it's best if
3 - to know if
3 - supposed to be
3 - a minute or
3 - i can't imagine
3 - is to run
3 - twice as fast
3 - as fast as
3 - you have an
3 - when the next
3 - to send your
3 - the pool operator
3 - until the next
3 - has the advantage
3 - way would be
3 - a few coins
3 - better make sure
3 - make sure they
3 - get it to
3 - in the linux
3 - it does it
3 - it should have
3 - it should work
3 - now available changes
3 - transaction fee setting
3 - it's not the
3 - the time it's
3 - which is currently
3 - if you copy
3 - to be updated
3 - into data and
3 - you do it
3 - it shouldn't be
3 - and hard to
3 - if data is
3 - to solve the
3 - be too much
3 - in the log
3 - on their own
3 - 0 conf transactions
3 - get into a
3 - 0 3 15
3 - think this is
3 - not so much
3 - only be used
3 - can use it
3 - could be used
3 - yet but the
3 - at least some
3 - that should be
3 - all you have
3 - i can think
3 - think of is
3 - the beginning of
3 - something like this
3 - the sample code
3 - can't encrypt messages
3 - the bitcoin network
3 - if it really
3 - it it would
3 - blk dat and
3 - just needs to
3 - a longer chain
3 - that it was
3 - it if it
3 - in the program
3 - put it back
3 - would just be
3 - just need a
3 - and it doesn't
3 - it take to
3 - you should be
3 - a 0 unconfirmed
3 - 0 unconfirmed transaction
3 - for some reason
3 - they have to
3 - have to upgrade
3 - your po file
3 - catalog update from
3 - seems to be
3 - it ought to
3 - i can't see
3 - can't see how
3 - is part of
3 - to be very
3 - the network to
3 - if we get
3 - as 0 unconfirmed
3 - chain if you
3 - need to look
3 - just in case
3 - it may take
3 - a while to
3 - you find a
3 - keep it running
3 - for a few
3 - a few people
3 - the dust spam
3 - the linux 64-bit
3 - in 64-bit mode
3 - if you'd like
3 - should upgrade to
3 - 0 unconfirmed transactions
3 - you haven't already
3 - add it to
3 - the price is
3 - minimum 0 01
3 - a long way
3 - what bitcoin is
3 - we should have
3 - at least a
3 - whether to use
3 - linux 0 3
3 - the root problem
3 - they have at
3 - changes to svn
3 - which will be
3 - use it to
3 - not implemented yet
3 - for you to
3 - only intended for
3 - won't be able
3 - who don't have
3 - a credit card
3 - more than an
3 - off by more
3 - next release 0
3 - release 0 3
3 - to change the
3 - ought to be
3 - we had a
3 - the reason i
3 - transaction fee the
3 - even though it
3 - is a lot
3 - you use a
3 - use bitcoin addresses
3 - i uploaded this
3 - change to svn
3 - switch to enable
3 - for the switch
3 - in the forum
3 - the forum and
3 - where we can
3 - don't use the
3 - between 0 and
3 - if that doesn't
3 - that doesn't work
3 - doesn't work right
3 - exactly the same
3 - doubleclick on the
3 - paying a 0
3 - the whole thing
3 - 0 01 fee
3 - version is the
3 - the reason for
3 - it uses the
3 - not able to
3 - here's what i
3 - i ended up
3 - it has the
3 - else to do
3 - for now you
3 - be more than
3 - the future we
3 - some kind of
3 - 0 01 transaction
3 - if that works
3 - svn rev 147
3 - this is in
3 - this is more
3 - they would be
3 - we needed to
3 - is an error
3 - you get a
3 - likely to be
3 - it's trying to
3 - i've thought about
3 - comment out the
3 - a false alarm
3 - is on its
3 - on its way
3 - updated the first
3 - only makes it
3 - if your clock
3 - that needs to
3 - response to an
3 - to an alert
3 - get a chance
3 - want to take
3 - to take your
3 - use the switch
3 - is an important
3 - over a communications
3 - a communications channel
3 - that there are
3 - be used as
3 - not like a
3 - how many blocks
3 - i thought it
3 - something in boost
3 - have to build
3 - available as a
3 - a debian package
3 - transactions from the
3 - is there something
3 - i can't remember
3 - to open the
3 - open the database
3 - that may be
3 - the disablesafemode switch
3 - this is what
3 - i believe the
3 - by default if
3 - the overflow bug
3 - then you can
3 - it has been
3 - that this is
3 - a warning message
3 - what's going on
3 - the cryptography mailing
3 - cryptography mailing list
3 - i've been working
3 - for received payments
3 - they only have
3 - debug log for
3 - a message box
3 - if someone has
3 - it here's the
3 - it may not
3 - faster on i5
3 - it that's a
3 - on all platforms
3 - is a problem
3 - if we need
3 - the proof-of-work chain
3 - proof-of-work chain is
3 - think about it
3 - do all the
3 - it's only if
3 - it down to
3 - small enough to
3 - displayed in the
3 - of the time
3 - the blk dat
3 - for the software
3 - the software to
3 - in the design
3 - no matter how
3 - would be able
3 - time to do
3 - back to a
3 - a certain block
3 - certain block number
3 - start out with
3 - you have is
3 - be possible to
3 - instead of the
3 - the bad block
3 - bad block chain
3 - the same speed
3 - gcc 4 3
3 - 4 3 3
3 - must be a
3 - looks like the
3 - to 6 blocks
3 - of 0 3
3 - of the nodes
3 - 50 of the
3 - if you still
3 - only if you
3 - can receive incoming
3 - nodes you're connected
3 - you connect to
3 - 4-way sse2 sha-256
3 - check if it's
3 - do that for
3 - it should start
3 - the most recent
3 - if you build
3 - 1 shut down
3 - shut down 2
3 - delete or move
3 - that will be
3 - i built it
3 - right i don't
3 - to check that
3 - should have been
3 - a transaction to
3 - you just need
3 - small amount of
3 - crypto asm sha-256
3 - need to know
3 - it doesn't look
3 - version of gcc
3 - gcc 3 4
3 - is a way
3 - would have the
3 - the private key
3 - in a nutshell
3 - bitcoin address you
3 - generate a new
3 - is possible for
3 - it as an
3 - a test build
3 - been connected before
3 - don't need irc
3 - more than 0
3 - that has the
3 - communication with the
3 - be something like
3 - have to keep
3 - the entire history
3 - history back to
3 - to the original
3 - but if the
3 - you would still
3 - to the ui
3 - the test network
3 - an attacker would
3 - a dos attack
3 - as well as
3 - the way it
3 - can't get it
3 - if they want
3 - get it back
3 - option to release
3 - to release it
3 - then you must
3 - payment up front
3 - would it be
3 - and if they
3 - problem may be
3 - a much better
3 - need to check
3 - check the signatures
3 - crypto 5 6
3 - 5 6 0
3 - in all the
3 - sorry about that
3 - careful not to
3 - would be so
3 - there's not much
3 - would be really
3 - is not implemented
3 - to let you
3 - let you know
3 - a payment to
3 - which could be
3 - money out of
3 - it's the same
3 - less than the
3 - would be the
3 - is proportional to
3 - use it if
3 - it doesn't matter
3 - proportional to their
3 - their cpu power
3 - to spend it
3 - the recipient and
3 - it is now
3 - for the transaction
3 - for 24 hours
3 - to add the
3 - they can become
3 - that the network
3 - to break the
3 - the fee if
3 - the files are
3 - need to upgrade
3 - 10 times as
3 - that we don't
3 - things on the
3 - minimize to the
3 - to the tray
3 - them out in
3 - the next adjustment
3 - on ubuntu 10
3 - want to make
3 - get rid of
3 - more time to
3 - the most popular
3 - it works well
3 - works well to
3 - with 0 3
3 - if you got
3 - to upgrade to
3 - to update the
3 - it's best to
3 - don't know why
3 - the code that
3 - how to fix
3 - to reproduce this
3 - to the database
3 - with the msvc
3 - into the main
3 - much of a
3 - we've got the
3 - bitcoin addresses are
3 - to use an
3 - an analytical attack
3 - are you going
3 - you going to
3 - have to get
3 - is that it's
3 - would increase the
3 - the hash function
3 - have to take
3 - go ahead and
3 - would only have
3 - tell it to
3 - after 0 2
3 - should be the
3 - json-rpc http authentication
3 - http authentication feature
3 - wrong with the
3 - i think they
3 - status 500 for
3 - maybe it should
3 - if we could
3 - should be fine
3 - make the initial
3 - there are no
3 - could be something
3 - please test it
3 - it to do
3 - it in a
3 - if we want
3 - http basic authentication
3 - spaces in it
3 - and the value
3 - a settings file
3 - would help to
3 - addition to the
3 - use the server
3 - working on a
3 - one or two
3 - the only one
3 - for them to
3 - was a lot
3 - you don't mind
3 - to add a
3 - less than 15
3 - in the help
3 - that it is
3 - would be far
3 - has to wait
3 - the network for
3 - a double-spent transaction
3 - the double-spender would
3 - chain up to
3 - there should be
3 - an easy way
3 - easy way to
3 - the lowest priority
3 - showing the recommended
3 - the recommended way
3 - recommended way to
3 - way to use
3 - example of a
3 - code showing the
3 - sample code showing
3 - more than a
3 - that way it
3 - more like the
3 - blocks to make
3 - 1 release candidate
3 - look at them
3 - but we don't
3 - know how to
3 - the fix for
3 - fix for the
3 - to update it
3 - can be done
3 - i have a
3 - at once and
3 - the cpu usage
3 - mac os x
3 - so we don't
3 - really need to
3 - the generate thread
3 - static link it
3 - does not need
3 - need to trust
3 - to trust a
3 - worth it for
3 - need to make
3 - any other nodes
3 - want it to
3 - hurry up and
3 - used for the
3 - with wxwidgets 2
3 - of wxwidgets 2
3 - a day or
3 - for the first
3 - it connect to
3 - you think it
3 - network and the
3 - it gets too
3 - on a single
3 - it it's not
3 - in the svn
3 - would only take
3 - anyone who wants
3 - some point if
3 - i really like
3 - of the two
3 - are gradually released
3 - gradually released to
3 - to the network's
3 - the network's nodes
3 - network's nodes based
3 - they contribute so
3 - contribute so you
3 - of them by
3 - them by contributing
3 - by contributing your
3 - read the forum
3 - forum to find
3 - find out more
3 - outbound connections from
3 - connections from 15
3 - from 15 to
3 - inbound accepting nodes
3 - we could do
3 - a certain number
3 - is it possible
3 - the first release
3 - every time you
3 - think that's the
3 - that's the best
3 - of the site
3 - there was an
3 - to one of
3 - could always be
3 - set up port
3 - the middle of
3 - it needs to
3 - that would make
3 - to install the
3 - faster than the
3 - the 32-bit version
3 - it's a little
3 - is needed to
3 - of berkeley db
3 - database log files
3 - that are not
3 - data is stored
3 - is stored in
3 - the database log
3 - you can delete
3 - the data directory
3 - with 0 2
3 - always going to
3 - changed it to
3 - so i made
3 - worth slightly more
3 - more money by
3 - to the right
3 - there are enough
3 - a second version
3 - but i have
3 - we can do
3 - the nature of
3 - or not and
3 - transaction to the
3 - no need to
3 - command line and
3 - line and json-rpc
3 - write code to
3 - included in the
3 - this will be
3 - sending by bitcoin
3 - can't be used
3 - will have a
3 - to pay the
3 - bitcoin addresses to
3 - to identify the
3 - could just as
3 - of having to
3 - that would require
3 - on the list
3 - that it's a
3 - no single point
3 - know what to
3 - you would be
3 - do you want
3 - one at a
3 - without verifying it
3 - like you say
3 - button next to
3 - next to the
3 - but not quite
3 - and there are
3 - it in the
3 - account on a
3 - on a website
3 - way to get
3 - the release build
3 - as a daemon
3 - command line or
3 - line or json-rpc
3 - in the ui
3 - with the address
3 - be free but
3 - but hard to
3 - hard to buy
3 - on the other
3 - easy to get
3 - the list of
3 - want to upload
3 - for such a
3 - for others to
3 - on the web
3 - the full size
3 - build-unix txt and
3 - when i'm finished
3 - 9 0 i
3 - a coin it
3 - it was a
3 - on my computer
3 - and how fast
3 - to link to
3 - the main window
3 - on linux it
3 - to run the
3 - have a single
3 - in the system
3 - to that address
3 - fixed a few
3 - value of the
3 - cost of production
3 - more than the
3 - be watching for
3 - in the directory
3 - locale langcode bitcoin
3 - langcode bitcoin mo
3 - because that would
3 - when the network
3 - right now there
3 - the first computer
3 - a transaction is
3 - the 0 2
3 - bitcoin org the
3 - if the same
3 - only have the
3 - 1 2 3
3 - to the world
3 - could do that
3 - the irc server
3 - you could use
3 - shouldn't be too
3 - when you send
3 - you send by
3 - as many coins
3 - the total effort
3 - across the network
3 - a block it
3 - an ip address
3 - it was received
3 - so people can
3 - version of wxwidgets
3 - make sense to

2 - you break off
2 - break off the
2 - for bitcoin the
2 - have to have

2 - for backward compatibility
2 - the merkle tree
2 - if we care

2 - chain this is
2 - that if they
2 - just one of

2 - cpu power this
2 - solve the problem
2 - they are a

2 - thanks for setting
2 - chance of getting
2 - ubuntu if you
2 - get wxwidgets 2
2 - 9 0 it
2 - it should just
2 - be a matter
2 - leave it there
2 - using it as

2 - have the accounts
2 - the accounts feature

2 - sure what the

2 - though i can't
2 - i don't get

2 - few days there

2 - easy to double-count
2 - that way is

2 - you count it
2 - the second spend
2 - the main addition
2 - main addition in

2 - the possibility that

2 - in the following

2 - get screwed up
2 - screwed up if
2 - if you're trying

2 - on windows it's
2 - more read caching
2 - normal initial download
2 - switch to a

2 - how fast is
2 - at one point
2 - is the indexing
2 - that is the

2 - are uncompressible the

2 - need the bitcoin
2 - says it found
2 - it found something
2 - show up in
2 - in their account
2 - check if the
2 - them if the
2 - try it with
2 - tests on windows
2 - but not when
2 - have a better
2 - as part of
2 - linux build so
2 - you get it
2 - could make it
2 - about 100 speedup
2 - that's what it
2 - what it does
2 - him to do
2 - there wasn't anything
2 - is wrong it
2 - to know what
2 - appears to be
2 - when that happens
2 - when the latest
2 - latest block is
2 - the chance to
2 - to change to
2 - it requests the
2 - from other nodes
2 - other nodes and
2 - from the one
2 - how it should
2 - has to read
2 - the file is
2 - if there's something
2 - that makes the
2 - every 500 blocks
2 - 0 3 17
2 - it was still
2 - to do was
2 - more changes to
2 - changes to make
2 - verifying and indexing
2 - if you downloaded
2 - the block download
2 - the block count
2 - to be sure
2 - berkeley db has
2 - we can make
2 - midstate data and
2 - functions you can
2 - should probably change
2 - probably change the
2 - be the same
2 - case where you
2 - you would use
2 - i think you
2 - does not return
2 - not return work
2 - return work when
2 - work when you
2 - when you submit
2 - you submit a
2 - submit a possible
2 - a possible hit
2 - possible hit only
2 - hit only when
2 - only when called
2 - when called without
2 - called without parameter
2 - without parameter the
2 - parameter the block
2 - the block field
2 - block field has
2 - field has been
2 - needed it's not
2 - a few changes
2 - lot of problems
2 - didn't want to
2 - the first half
2 - half of the
2 - of the data
2 - the block and
2 - true if it
2 - it was successful
2 - in the data
2 - but with the
2 - always the same
2 - would be too
2 - up on the
2 - as possible to
2 - to shut down
2 - shut down the
2 - this version has
2 - has the new
2 - is a more
2 - like this and
2 - i just uploaded
2 - own 0 conf
2 - have to wait
2 - a block at
2 - time version 0
2 - problem with this
2 - i think this
2 - 0 01 it's
2 - it's not so
2 - free transactions can
2 - over so often
2 - there has to
2 - in the event
2 - the event of
2 - event of a
2 - of a block
2 - into the chain
2 - and all its
2 - it locks the
2 - could be implemented
2 - you should use
2 - at least 1
2 - until it does
2 - the software would
2 - have to know
2 - to know whether
2 - to spend your
2 - we'll need to
2 - to do everything
2 - a flood you
2 - jump the queue
2 - as a last
2 - a last resort
2 - your coins over
2 - coins over rapidly
2 - was meant to
2 - meant to be
2 - the 16x16 and
2 - 16x16 and 20x20
2 - it's the best
2 - room for improvement
2 - for improvement at
2 - it'll be a
2 - be a lot
2 - thing i can
2 - are other versions
2 - other versions of
2 - mingwm10 dll is
2 - a tiny little
2 - that came with
2 - when you build
2 - the last thing
2 - too close to
2 - make it possible
2 - of your own
2 - only sign signatures
2 - sign signatures it
2 - be an accident
2 - an accident waiting
2 - accident waiting to
2 - waiting to happen
2 - be a separate
2 - be recorded in
2 - recorded in the

2 - but it's not
2 - the seed nodes
2 - to be more
2 - svn rev 161
2 - rev 161 has
2 - transactions can be
2 - this is needed
2 - here's a windows
2 - a windows build
2 - if you already
2 - you already had

2 - would put it
2 - to the back
2 - you can try
2 - there's something wrong
2 - in it are
2 - faster with 4way
2 - with 4way if

2 - 4-way 128-bit sse2
2 - amd in 64-bit
2 - see if that's
2 - might not work
2 - not work on
2 - it hard to
2 - what it says
2 - 3 13 2
2 - the mac osx
2 - mac osx build
2 - doesn't work with
2 - please try this
2 - try this instead
2 - and let me
2 - it right you
2 - right you can
2 - improvements for the
2 - windows build of
2 - too late for
2 - like if you
2 - be something more
2 - it's harder to
2 - think of how
2 - of how to
2 - as the block
2 - it goes up
2 - pretty much always
2 - the minimum 0
2 - goes a long
2 - identifying what it
2 - to at least
2 - as simple as
2 - that we should
2 - have a paragraph
2 - in one of
2 - didn't make any
2 - po file i
2 - i uploaded to
2 - to this message
2 - 3 13 release
2 - 13 release candidate
2 - so please test
2 - internal version number
2 - transactions sent by
2 - sent by ip
2 - ip address if
2 - auto-detect whether to
2 - has been received
2 - the credit amount
2 - and the amount
2 - i didn't make
2 - enough to be
2 - the changes to
2 - any of these
2 - of these transactions
2 - upgraded to 0
2 - if you've already
2 - it's not implemented
2 - implemented yet but
2 - the network can
2 - can support a
2 - that requires two
2 - requires two signatures
2 - good as a
2 - this kind of
2 - kind of escrow
2 - they're only intended
2 - able to see
2 - the ui will
2 - would be convenient
2 - be convenient for
2 - people who don't
2 - i don't understand
2 - the median of
2 - the user to
2 - user to fix
2 - going to change
2 - the format of
2 - otherwise it would
2 - be worked around
2 - very large transactions
2 - fee the threshold
2 - 000 btc for
2 - generated coins it
2 - it would mostly
2 - and won't be
2 - you only have
2 - have to pay
2 - it this is
2 - address would be
2 - to all the
2 - all the work
2 - the work of
2 - the trouble of
2 - of getting a
2 - but most of
2 - name for the
2 - there's a better
2 - we can change
2 - change it again
2 - again i don't
2 - to have one
2 - more likely to
2 - posted in the
2 - if they were
2 - that's not really
2 - not really a
2 - i've seen on
2 - i'm still thinking
2 - still thinking about
2 - the kind of
2 - db h is
2 - util h and
2 - there be some
2 - the latest version
2 - use a few
2 - think the only
2 - not sure but
2 - on the stack
2 - 0 and 2
2 - and 2 connections
2 - using the connect
2 - the connect switch
2 - is this a
2 - between connection attempts
2 - as it can
2 - if the only
2 - the only library
2 - only library is
2 - then there's a
2 - there's a project
2 - a project to
2 - project to make
2 - to make an
2 - an open source
2 - one if the
2 - or public domain
2 - with the os
2 - the flag in
2 - flag in rev
2 - in rev 153
2 - the database files
2 - database files so
2 - 20 minutes 51
2 - minutes 51 seconds
2 - i wasn't expecting
2 - them to come
2 - there a way
2 - of both worlds
2 - but it does
2 - it at the
2 - the fix is
2 - able to send
2 - don't think you
2 - the code to
2 - code to do
2 - to send the
2 - i should add
2 - should add a
2 - a special case
2 - is the one
2 - bitcoin address when
2 - when you sent
2 - how it would
2 - the difference in
2 - block number is
2 - number is the
2 - i was not
2 - was not able
2 - to find any
2 - what i ended
2 - the best choice
2 - do that i
2 - can change the
2 - see if it
2 - to see how
2 - longer to get
2 - i did a
2 - that would still
2 - per block the
2 - future we can
2 - as needed if
2 - now it would
2 - a more standard
2 - to cause an
2 - cause an exception
2 - code that checks
2 - that checks the
2 - of the error
2 - which is the
2 - another option is
2 - option is to
2 - to reduce the
2 - reduce the number
2 - of free transactions
2 - per block before
2 - the threshold should
2 - lower than it
2 - there is an
2 - an error the
2 - locks the wallet
2 - sure you get
2 - they need to
2 - need to correct
2 - to fix the
2 - you can probably
2 - if that was
2 - it all the
2 - written with the
2 - over the network
2 - the network would
2 - its way out
2 - way out anyway
2 - and 64-bit linux
2 - the 4way code
2 - it only makes
2 - which makes it
2 - makes it a
2 - it a little
2 - a little faster
2 - clock is too
2 - is too far
2 - too far off
2 - alert system can
2 - if you're running
2 - you're running a
2 - an important security
2 - the following json-rpc
2 - if you decide
2 - you decide it's
2 - decide it's a
2 - it's a false
2 - false alarm and
2 - alarm and want
2 - and want to
2 - take your chances
2 - your chances you
2 - chances you can
2 - a problem is
2 - try to make
2 - can make sure
2 - over a long
2 - and have the
2 - maybe it could
2 - could get an
2 - i would definitely
2 - it i think
2 - nothing in the
2 - value that could
2 - would still take
2 - the target is
2 - sorry i've been
2 - i still can't
2 - want to avoid
2 - of code to
2 - shy away from
2 - in the 90's
2 - in rpc cpp
2 - out to be
2 - i'd rather call
2 - rather call an
2 - call an existing
2 - an existing file
2 - existing file copy
2 - file copy function
2 - copy function than
2 - function than make
2 - than make and
2 - make and test
2 - and test my
2 - test my own
2 - thought it would
2 - memory and write
2 - for me it's
2 - shell usr bin
2 - usr bin wx-config
2 - build problems with
2 - there wasn't time
2 - wasn't time to
2 - of wxwidgets that
2 - happens to be
2 - why is it
2 - to build it
2 - we should do
2 - make sure it's
2 - with 2 8
2 - ansi and utf-16
2 - lot of people
2 - the main backup
2 - main backup improvement
2 - backup improvement will
2 - improvement will be
2 - pool of keys
2 - of keys and
2 - keys and a
2 - and a rescan
2 - a rescan at
2 - rescan at load
2 - at load to
2 - load to scrape
2 - to scrape missed
2 - scrape missed transactions
2 - missed transactions from
2 - from the block
2 - the block history
2 - block history then
2 - history then a
2 - then a backup
2 - a backup will
2 - backup will last
2 - will last forward
2 - last forward for
2 - forward for a
2 - to post the
2 - wallet dat to
2 - it that would
2 - so maybe it
2 - could be done
2 - be done first
2 - to help the
2 - more details about
2 - details about what
2 - make it safe
2 - it safe for
2 - be an improvement
2 - then what else
2 - an initial block
2 - do what you
2 - being able to
2 - the database it
2 - has a new
2 - very new and
2 - still under construction
2 - i haven't settled
2 - haven't settled on
2 - add the disablesafemode
2 - a new version
2 - be a temporary
2 - think the people
2 - the switch name
2 - the safer option
2 - enabled by default
2 - like the money
2 - until you upgrade
2 - getting surprised by
2 - is better than
2 - haven't found any
2 - and it has
2 - this can be
2 - can be scaled
2 - back i'm not
2 - software this is
2 - as version 0
2 - that if a
2 - message displays on
2 - displays on the
2 - the website and
2 - website and forum
2 - like the overflow
2 - it's important that
2 - out what's going
2 - or two ago
2 - through the network
2 - private key that
2 - message on the
2 - i didn't know
2 - search debug log
2 - after that the
2 - svn rev 141
2 - up a message
2 - part will be
2 - covered in the
2 - pops up a
2 - all the transactions
2 - back into the
2 - add to the
2 - your number of
2 - we could use
2 - make sure your
2 - microsoft security essentials
2 - your wallet dat
2 - time to try
2 - if you start
2 - that's the first
2 - i take it
2 - that's a really
2 - utf-8 on all
2 - of 2 8
2 - 8 and its
2 - on 2 9
2 - we were using
2 - was just a
2 - a problem that
2 - release in the
2 - it only go
2 - only go back
2 - to the last
2 - a problem in
2 - always make sure
2 - sure it goes
2 - but they are
2 - to include the
2 - block so they're
2 - so it may
2 - until the transaction
2 - the transaction gets
2 - 3 9 and
2 - 9 and lower
2 - and lower nodes
2 - without having to
2 - i went with
2 - went with the
2 - the greatest proof-of-work
2 - to switch to
2 - has to go
2 - the way back
2 - svn rev 139
2 - we wouldn't have
2 - to the fork
2 - this at the
2 - time it might
2 - it might take
2 - it's too slow
2 - we could have
2 - to a certain
2 - it's always been
2 - as a reference
2 - against the block
2 - people are looking
2 - blocks will be
2 - of the current
2 - cause a reorg
2 - i was thinking
2 - it finds a
2 - to 0 so
2 - so it can't
2 - again and it
2 - would require a
2 - that sets the
2 - that instead of
2 - of the code
2 - with the current
2 - the current block
2 - no longer necessary
2 - longer necessary to
2 - necessary to delete
2 - can just upgrade
2 - just upgrade and
2 - upgrade and it'll
2 - reorg away the
2 - away the bad
2 - an intel core
2 - speedup with 4way
2 - that works that's
2 - you may be
2 - the work was
2 - was in the
2 - do you get
2 - findstr c version
2 - c version message
2 - version message debug
2 - message debug log
2 - debug log it
2 - that should have
2 - per hour the
2 - as more nodes
2 - more nodes upgrade
2 - to more than
2 - more than half
2 - more than 50
2 - than 50 of
2 - of the node
2 - the good chain
2 - good chain overtakes
2 - chain overtakes the
2 - overtakes the bad
2 - 3 10 nodes
2 - to get any
2 - 2 if you
2 - transactions until the
2 - back to 0
2 - in the bad
2 - post their ip
2 - all the nodes
2 - that at least
2 - least one node
2 - be 0 3
2 - up more than

2 - redownload the rest
2 - take about an
2 - about an hour
2 - is uploaded to
2 - svn rev 132
2 - the rest if
2 - enough that it
2 - it can someone
2 - would help if
2 - the current one
2 - you generate the
2 - other misc changes
2 - the patch for
2 - i have more
2 - built it right
2 - it right i
2 - an i5 or
2 - i5 or amd
2 - to test with
2 - i'm also curious
2 - also curious if
2 - on 32-bit linux
2 - was the main
2 - the version of
2 - places where it's
2 - where it's cheapest
2 - want to get
2 - get some coins
2 - them there are
2 - your computer's heat
2 - than electric then
2 - it on their
2 - comes into play
2 - if you just
2 - is a nice
2 - linux please report
2 - please report back
2 - report back your
2 - to know about
2 - know about the
2 - gcc 4 4
2 - i have it
2 - have it working
2 - working with test
2 - with test cpp
2 - test cpp but
2 - when called by
2 - called by bitcoinminer
2 - 3 3 on
2 - i found the
2 - gcc 4 5
2 - as a temporary
2 - with mingw gcc
2 - the problem i'll
2 - i'll see if
2 - i can get
2 - does it hide
2 - what is the
2 - can be discarded
2 - the value came
2 - value came from
2 - if they can
2 - of it does
2 - is that it
2 - did some research
2 - here in the
2 - what we need
2 - we need is
2 - a public key
2 - any one of
2 - key for each
2 - came from the
2 - for something to
2 - as an example
2 - and you wouldn't
2 - here's a test
2 - test build if
2 - build if you'd
2 - before 0 3
2 - because you can't
2 - to download the
2 - ever been connected
2 - include a transaction
2 - your transactions if
2 - use more than
2 - than 0 01
2 - it's just there
2 - it probably won't
2 - probably won't be
2 - and it can
2 - compared to the
2 - i got a
2 - svn rev 130
2 - with a dial-up
2 - a dial-up modem
2 - dial-up modem or
2 - rest of your
2 - the frequency of
2 - the network doesn't
2 - network doesn't know
2 - the values and
2 - values and lineage
2 - and lineage of
2 - lineage of the
2 - the clients would
2 - clients would have
2 - keep the history
2 - entire history back
2 - the original generated
2 - and we should
2 - nice to keep
2 - long as we
2 - but for now
2 - so new users
2 - new users can
2 - implement client-only mode
2 - still be able
2 - had time yet
2 - accept old transactions
2 - solution would be
2 - to implement the
2 - of the network's
2 - get away with
2 - receive a payment
2 - a few seconds
2 - to add up
2 - to near the
2 - in it and
2 - it had to
2 - needs to do
2 - willing to have
2 - to be stored
2 - such as the
2 - doesn't know what
2 - a client can
2 - if an outpoint
2 - an outpoint has
2 - outpoint has been
2 - has been spent
2 - it spent the
2 - a salt so
2 - you know the
2 - what the next
2 - keep the entire
2 - check that the
2 - handling a lot
2 - lot of money
2 - to see a
2 - end up seeing
2 - up seeing a
2 - of the history
2 - could be made
2 - lot of the
2 - updated svn thanks
2 - the future it
2 - you can't get
2 - has the option
2 - the thief gets
2 - thief gets the
2 - gets the money
2 - it back but
2 - it had a
2 - a kill switch
2 - it it'll be
2 - implementation of bitcoin
2 - a coin can
2 - coin can be
2 - with a timestamp
2 - there's too much
2 - can't check the
2 - on this it's
2 - electric heat where
2 - and you're using
2 - outbound connections to
2 - the top of
2 - i uploaded 0
2 - uploaded 0 3
2 - 3 8 1
2 - for linux with
2 - i ran a
2 - at least once
2 - not be any
2 - you've found a
2 - please tell me
2 - please and i'll
2 - with the 64-bit
2 - after 0 3
2 - pentium 3 or
2 - 3 or older
2 - i was trying
2 - was trying to
2 - place where it
2 - at compile time
2 - switch at runtime
2 - to be careful
2 - be careful not
2 - not to break
2 - one type of
2 - it is but
2 - with the slow
2 - was working on
2 - time to implement
2 - to implement it
2 - the money in
2 - the money back
2 - the seller has
2 - to release the
2 - release the money
2 - but at least
2 - to anyone else
2 - and i'll give
2 - i'll give you
2 - at that point
2 - people won't be
2 - able to understand
2 - to understand the
2 - that there's no
2 - at all i
2 - i guess that
2 - the utility of
2 - will be the
2 - cost of electricity
2 - each node's influence
2 - cpu power the
2 - much easier to
2 - i suppose it
2 - for an average
2 - running it all
2 - how that could
2 - for a node
2 - the time to
2 - worry about a
2 - once you get
2 - get away from
2 - a system where
2 - to their cpu
2 - you give the
2 - if you're only
2 - only going to
2 - the block that
2 - do you mean
2 - it if we
2 - be an actual
2 - it only takes
2 - way to implement
2 - to implement that
2 - that all the
2 - the transaction fees
2 - what about the
2 - fees for the
2 - the transaction fee's
2 - transaction fee's transaction
2 - transaction it's not
2 - it's better to
2 - to let it
2 - the rate limit
2 - fee to the
2 - then what about
2 - is still small
2 - first time you
2 - be easier for
2 - they know what
2 - is more than
2 - bitcoin is practical
2 - is practical for
2 - practical for smaller
2 - right now it
2 - if bitcoin catches
2 - bitcoin catches on
2 - by that time
2 - of network nodes
2 - i think in
2 - 5 or 10
2 - the bandwidth and
2 - i think most
2 - would like to
2 - you would need
2 - transaction fee 0
2 - can keep it
2 - that way if
2 - and you'd have
2 - just add it
2 - less than 0
2 - you might call
2 - top of the
2 - but it doesn't
2 - claim to be
2 - to be practical
2 - was going to
2 - getting slashdotted i
2 - not on the
2 - no idea how
2 - to limit the
2 - everyone should upgrade
2 - it then it
2 - be correct you
2 - you may need
2 - may need to
2 - an error it
2 - 2 4x faster
2 - possible for the
2 - for the client
2 - the client to
2 - the flow of
2 - just by chance
2 - it could tell
2 - that case it
2 - it would take
2 - the minority fork
2 - times as long
2 - also it would
2 - guess we should
2 - where there's no
2 - not to use
2 - 0 3 7
2 - it it was
2 - reason i didn't
2 - i didn't use
2 - to make absolutely
2 - and be sure
2 - we have is
2 - the way the
2 - is about the
2 - blocks and transactions
2 - there are some
2 - it doesn't work
2 - out in the
2 - anything to the
2 - to the console
2 - are you sure
2 - you sure you
2 - with boost 1
2 - boost 1 37
2 - next adjustment in
2 - 3 5 days
2 - about that for
2 - that wouldn't work
2 - for boost 1
2 - to get libboost-all-dev
2 - makes it hard
2 - btw i tried
2 - but it didn't
2 - bitcoin org or
2 - what are you
2 - latch onto that
2 - onto that for
2 - that way and
2 - don't think we
2 - the wrong thing
2 - the status of
2 - would be kinda
2 - than the amount
2 - don't have enough
2 - have enough money
2 - we don't really
2 - don't really need
2 - i think i'll
2 - time to get
2 - to get rid
2 - i should have
2 - it's a lot
2 - is the most
2 - up to 2
2 - to 2 hours
2 - length of time
2 - 3 0 i
2 - linux build is
2 - to the old
2 - problem is that
2 - to delete or
2 - files somewhere else
2 - windows and linux
2 - and linux users
2 - linux users if
2 - users if you
2 - you got 0
2 - got 0 3
2 - 0 3 5
2 - 3 5 you
2 - 5 you still
2 - time to update
2 - now you can
2 - shut down your
2 - in the meantime
2 - 3 6 asap
2 - where it was
2 - it was possible
2 - you upgrade to
2 - is if you
2 - if you tell
2 - we have that
2 - a network node
2 - would be like
2 - the design supports
2 - a node the
2 - nodes will be
2 - the rest will
2 - rest will be
2 - only do transactions
2 - do transactions and
2 - transactions and don't
2 - and don't generate
2 - in something like
2 - something like 10
2 - like 10 seconds
2 - 10 seconds or
2 - seconds or less
2 - don't have time
2 - looking at the
2 - code here's the
2 - earlier than the
2 - the previous block
2 - greater than the
2 - next block if
2 - if the previous
2 - gcc on linux
2 - know if that
2 - bitcoind datadir subdir
2 - looks like you
2 - if it runs
2 - a subset of
2 - the crypto 5
2 - the svn i
2 - shouldn't be any
2 - speedup is about
2 - 3 3 i
2 - anyway i added
2 - post in the
2 - soon as it
2 - i replaced the
2 - know if i
2 - one that's been
2 - bitcoin org site
2 - case you need
2 - was supposed to
2 - supposed to work
2 - going to put
2 - to svn as
2 - use a birthday
2 - a birthday attack
2 - could do a
2 - are the only
2 - the only place
2 - only place where
2 - if i'm wrong
2 - of control over
2 - do with it
2 - so you would
2 - would still have
2 - have to break
2 - only serves as
2 - sign it with
2 - need to find
2 - to find a
2 - find a collision
2 - point is that
2 - that it's easy
2 - required to be
2 - bitcoin address are
2 - to make bitcoin
2 - of the public
2 - break the hash
2 - best if you
2 - it to me
2 - can be fixed
2 - important security improvements
2 - 2 and 0
2 - and 0 3
2 - new features gavin
2 - features gavin andresen's
2 - gavin andresen's http
2 - andresen's http authentication
2 - http authentication to
2 - authentication to secure
2 - to secure json-rpc
2 - secure json-rpc 5x
2 - json-rpc 5x faster
2 - 5x faster initial
2 - faster initial block
2 - block download under
2 - download under 30
2 - under 30 minutes
2 - on the test
2 - how to serialize
2 - do it and
2 - it and i
2 - swap in the
2 - knows how to
2 - and should be
2 - into 0 3
2 - if you're on
2 - 30 minutes the
2 - the json-rpc http
2 - authentication feature in
2 - feature in 0
2 - 3 3 solves
2 - 3 solves this
2 - solves this problem
2 - is supposed to
2 - an error reply
2 - can't remember where
2 - remember where i
2 - something wrong with
2 - to send back
2 - http status 500
2 - if it contains
2 - wonder if that
2 - for the whole
2 - nice if we
2 - if at all
2 - authentication should be
2 - the config file
2 - i can see
2 - what if the
2 - there are many
2 - allow you to
2 - but i hope
2 - server or daemon
2 - that it should
2 - it should fail
2 - a warning if
2 - the changes in
2 - it does in
2 - down to the
2 - like to start
2 - to start using
2 - and the other
2 - from 0 3
2 - i've been running
2 - over the last
2 - the last 24
2 - last 24 hours
2 - and restarts it
2 - to do an
2 - this change is
2 - dat you can
2 - you can always
2 - the body of
2 - body of the
2 - build please test
2 - have to figure
2 - to figure it
2 - many of the
2 - has the same
2 - gavin pointed out
2 - can use more
2 - key some full
2 - some full sentence
2 - full sentence with
2 - sentence with spaces
2 - with spaces in
2 - the beginning and
2 - this sentence would
2 - sentence would be
2 - would be this
2 - guess this is
2 - is ok too
2 - sure there's a
2 - and i'm inclined
2 - i'm inclined to
2 - to disable it
2 - all the strings
2 - also have to
2 - at the end
2 - we could easily
2 - we need more
2 - that doesn't mean
2 - it could always
2 - what's the most
2 - settings file format
2 - i've never seen
2 - it get the
2 - so the current
2 - bitcoin is an
2 - a big hurry
2 - big hurry to
2 - want something that
2 - works if you
2 - if you post
2 - but bitcoin is
2 - is really important
2 - the rule is
2 - you can find
2 - the bitcoin directory
2 - should be considered
2 - to figure out
2 - in the http
2 - the parameter list
2 - but then you
2 - then you still
2 - not sure is
2 - bitcoind on a
2 - on 127 0
2 - on the json-rpc
2 - the same machine
2 - quite a bit
2 - you give me
2 - that does it
2 - you're talking about
2 - data in a
2 - to come up
2 - much as i
2 - set up to
2 - a better idea
2 - eventually be a
2 - you don't set
2 - it's a short
2 - a short password
2 - to protect against
2 - is less than
2 - 15 if you
2 - it's a single
2 - if one has
2 - one has a
2 - so you can't
2 - the right thing
2 - to 127 0
2 - is the case
2 - where you do
2 - the change to
2 - in the windows
2 - not intended to
2 - block chain was
2 - block download faster
2 - possible for a
2 - the network nodes
2 - when you broadcast
2 - if someone else
2 - time it's a
2 - a race to
2 - when it gets
2 - and at the
2 - if it receives
2 - it receives a
2 - percentage of the
2 - upgrade to this
2 - to this version
2 - block chain up
2 - up to this
2 - to this point
2 - so even if
2 - if someone does
2 - have more than
2 - block chain before
2 - once the software
2 - no point in
2 - if someone gets
2 - the wallet to
2 - new address is
2 - so it wouldn't
2 - have a lot
2 - lot of them
2 - requests a new
2 - stored in the
2 - and a new
2 - their wallet dat
2 - the case of
2 - floating point to
2 - 1 139999999999 is
2 - could only be
2 - so it must
2 - the code is
2 - of an easy
2 - the generate threads
2 - to the lowest
2 - download links are
2 - links are on
2 - are on the
2 - to sourceforge and
2 - sourceforge and updated
2 - and updated the
2 - updated the links
2 - the links on
2 - need to update
2 - unless you had
2 - you've got it
2 - someone to write
2 - use the json-rpc
2 - to create an
2 - logged in to
2 - you show the
2 - can send to
2 - to add funds
2 - it has then
2 - replace it with
2 - bitcoin address for
2 - in your database
2 - i posted a
2 - posted a sample
2 - a sample code
2 - sample code fragment
2 - somewhere search on
2 - search on getnewaddress
2 - the username as
2 - username as the
2 - as the label
2 - of the account
2 - to keep a
2 - the current balance
2 - than 0 confirmations
2 - 0 confirmations it's
2 - nice if you
2 - selling digital goods
2 - fine to accept
2 - to accept 0
2 - accept 0 confirmations
2 - for this would
2 - to send a
2 - send a payment
2 - payment to a
2 - code should be
2 - make it a
2 - an example of
2 - of a site
2 - is trying to
2 - average of 6
2 - of 6 blocks
2 - close to 6
2 - site where you
2 - time between blocks
2 - and you should
2 - us 0 02
2 - if you're going
2 - you're going to
2 - more than 8
2 - the gateway node
2 - it will not
2 - incoming connections then
2 - connecting to you
2 - in init cpp
2 - it'll be in
2 - too late to
2 - could be a
2 - to 181 54
2 - few minutes ago
2 - about a week
2 - it so people
2 - amount of time
2 - sha256 is not
2 - not like the
2 - like the step
2 - the step from
2 - from 32-bit to
2 - 32-bit to 64-bit
2 - ran out of
2 - out of address
2 - of address space
2 - address space with
2 - by moore's law
2 - going to get
2 - to bring it
2 - has a good
2 - a good chance
2 - gradually we can
2 - transition to a
2 - new hash function
2 - after a certain
2 - block number everyone
2 - number everyone would
2 - new hash of
2 - hash of all
2 - all the old
2 - the old blocks
2 - old blocks to
2 - block with the
2 - the same old
2 - same old hash
2 - i like that
2 - a fan of
2 - the comment header
2 - i like to
2 - like to keep
2 - what would be
2 - sorry to be
2 - be a wet
2 - a wet blanket
2 - time i've seen
2 - i've seen this
2 - case i need
2 - proof-of-work difficulty is
2 - days since the
2 - since the last
2 - put it at
2 - is 14 days
2 - that must be
2 - looking for a
2 - seems like a
2 - 1 or 2
2 - run it with
2 - the undocumented switch
2 - undocumented switch minimizetotray
2 - the option is
2 - is available in
2 - available in the
2 - don't know how
2 - fix it it's
2 - link in the
2 - never heard of
2 - heard of that
2 - it do you
2 - running it on
2 - fixed in the
2 - for you thanks
2 - the task manager
2 - thanks for the
2 - these to the
2 - the download links
2 - 3 1 soon
2 - for someone to
2 - updated bitcoin po
2 - you already have
2 - already have a
2 - a po file
2 - from the 0
2 - need to give
2 - look at it
2 - strings are in
2 - problem i think
2 - lot of things
2 - that your cpu
2 - cpu usage is
2 - all the cpu
2 - the cpu time
2 - cpu meter is
2 - meter is 100
2 - to static link
2 - i will be
2 - the full block
2 - simplified payment verification
2 - the lightweight client
2 - send and receive
2 - and receive transactions
2 - a node to
2 - to verify payments
2 - payments it can
2 - the plan is
2 - plan is to
2 - is to implement
2 - a full network
2 - full network node
2 - it for more
2 - could be millions
2 - working on it
2 - your chances of
2 - each time you
2 - since your computer
2 - your computer started
2 - the network you
2 - you have connections
2 - warning this block
2 - this block was
2 - block was not
2 - was not received
2 - not received by
2 - received by any
2 - by any other
2 - connections but they
2 - lowest priority the
2 - generate thread only
2 - thread only changes
2 - a block when
2 - found a block
2 - to hurry up
2 - than a second
2 - every few days
2 - be a 0
2 - the minimize to
2 - but then it
2 - better to have
2 - to have the
2 - one of those
2 - to load a
2 - it sounds like
2 - connections to be
2 - to be made
2 - to be sent
2 - sent or received
2 - need to understand
2 - to turn off
2 - problem is i
2 - there isn't a
2 - out of memory
2 - it was getting
2 - of the program
2 - we can still
2 - time it would
2 - money with the
2 - thinking about how
2 - the moment you
2 - moment you can
2 - don't let it
2 - let it connect
2 - have a server
2 - a server farm
2 - the first two
2 - you wouldn't want
2 - on xp and
2 - the people who
2 - to corner the
2 - 11 an ounce
2 - an ounce in
2 - much of the
2 - but in the
2 - svn version it
2 - itself off from
2 - off from the
2 - from the rest
2 - flow the block
2 - block chain over
2 - transactions in the
2 - in the shorter
2 - the shorter fork
2 - of the segmentation
2 - the segmentation to
2 - segmentation to double-spend
2 - on each side
2 - you're in the
2 - in the smaller
2 - the smaller segment
2 - for example if
2 - 0 2 to
2 - in with the
2 - run bitcoin and
2 - does it work
2 - a ton of
2 - all at once
2 - our own seed
2 - own seed system
2 - lfnet org is
2 - into it and
2 - really like the
2 - 0 3 released
2 - or read the
2 - i've been meaning
2 - been meaning to
2 - to edit the
2 - the homepage the
2 - was a discussion
2 - estimate based on
2 - there's nothing to
2 - 15 to 8
2 - 8 is still
2 - is still plenty
2 - and check it
2 - other than the
2 - in readme txt
2 - readme txt and
2 - i reduced the
2 - nodes that accept
2 - get too many
2 - slow thanks for
2 - to 10 or
2 - users can see
2 - know how many
2 - how many connections
2 - can't imagine how
2 - backend support for
2 - for things that
2 - 0 1 0
2 - give you a
2 - same class b
2 - 3 almost ready
2 - almost ready thread
2 - a front end
2 - own bitcoin server
2 - bitcoin server at
2 - have a static
2 - static ip and
2 - and it's too
2 - it's too much
2 - removed see below
2 - uses irc lfnet
2 - about time we
2 - 1 3 the
2 - of the status
2 - lfnet org instead
2 - org instead of
2 - instead of freenode
2 - 0 2 and
2 - without irc if
2 - irc it can
2 - speedup from 32-bit
2 - of gcc on
2 - if it could
2 - an older version
2 - version then it
2 - there any way
2 - the 64-bit version
2 - sha-256 is a
2 - is a 32-bit
2 - a 32-bit algorithm
2 - all versions of
2 - should make the
2 - here's rc1 for
2 - both 32-bit and
2 - 32-bit and 64-bit
2 - instructions for building
2 - which is needed
2 - change it back
2 - the dat files
2 - dat files are
2 - in wallet dat
2 - dat if you

2 - used so that
2 - if the database
2 - the program is
2 - it works fine
2 - if the appdata
2 - the appdata directory
2 - appdata directory exists
2 - what operating system
2 - the directory where
2 - directory where the
2 - going to test
2 - the files in
2 - can never be

2 - it's too late
2 - as it does
2 - the latest svn
2 - on my list
2 - to do for
2 - ready to release
2 - the taskbar button
2 - but now that
2 - now that you
2 - click on it
2 - svn thanks for
2 - for testing i
2 - appdata bitcoin debug
2 - bitcoin debug log
2 - starts to be
2 - with lots of
2 - make more money
2 - money by generating

2 - minimize maximize close
2 - on the right
2 - bitcoin address on
2 - address on the
2 - for those who
2 - new address whenever
2 - the time of
2 - reflect badly on
2 - version i would
2 - and i don't
2 - only one version
2 - that's one of
2 - think of the
2 - the node network
2 - in a big
2 - the future but
2 - but they all
2 - they all had
2 - the beginning to
2 - beginning to make
2 - of the design
2 - the mit license
2 - i'm working on
2 - working on getting
2 - as i can
2 - since 0 2
2 - german dutch and
2 - dutch and italian
2 - and italian translations
2 - datawraith xunie and
2 - xunie and joozero
2 - is already doing
2 - for you i
2 - you i don't
2 - going to a
2 - code to make
2 - it doesn't contain
2 - the transactions they
2 - be accepted if
2 - if it did
2 - since there's no
2 - on linux the
2 - the last few
2 - is very strong
2 - about what the
2 - was before the
2 - be programmed to
2 - the software could
2 - which is what
2 - is what the
2 - server on a
2 - by ip we
2 - can connect to
2 - a domain name
2 - owner of that
2 - the payment is
2 - thing in the
2 - the order number
2 - the payment and
2 - an error message
2 - it's about time
2 - static nodes to
2 - stay connected to
2 - get the list
2 - won't be a
2 - nodes that are
2 - are currently online
2 - the nodes you
2 - an irc server
2 - to svn thanks
2 - thanks that's a
2 - but it could
2 - to the ip
2 - to use ssl
2 - use ssl for
2 - using the bitcoin
2 - to who you
2 - bitcoin address would
2 - the transaction only
2 - new generated bitcoin
2 - it to svn
2 - requires a transaction
2 - transaction is over
2 - is over the
2 - over the size
2 - the size limit
2 - a fee of
2 - the nodes that
2 - support the network
2 - is that you
2 - to trust the
2 - from if you
2 - how long is
2 - long is the
2 - is the initial
2 - digital goods and
2 - goods and services
2 - amount received by
2 - so far i've
2 - this is on
2 - some sample code
2 - a new button
2 - new button next
2 - and amounts they've
2 - amounts they've received
2 - for consistency i
2 - so as not
2 - as not to
2 - is that if
2 - if you give
2 - can get the
2 - such as in
2 - response to a
2 - the complete list
2 - more often than
2 - if you're selling
2 - and it can't
2 - can't be resold
2 - bitcoin uses ec-dsa
2 - uses ec-dsa which
2 - which can only
2 - of magnitude bigger
2 - as it downloads
2 - that takes a
2 - takes a long
2 - block download typically
2 - about the same
2 - ways to do
2 - do a more
2 - other higher priority
2 - higher priority things
2 - to do transactions
2 - kind of like
2 - way of doing
2 - for most people
2 - most people the
2 - that you have
2 - and if you
2 - debug build and
2 - don't care that
2 - a daemon and
2 - be controlled by
2 - controlled by command
2 - by command line
2 - for building on
2 - the moment it
2 - the incoming port
2 - port number i'm
2 - think of any
2 - redundancy if you
2 - bitcoin addresses you
2 - must be kept
2 - anything sent to
2 - sent to it
2 - one for each
2 - what i did
2 - number of days
2 - received with the
2 - it would fail
2 - is a constant
2 - it does for
2 - it would give
2 - think we can
2 - for bitcoin to
2 - the http response
2 - as a user
2 - address and amount
2 - it would work
2 - just like a
2 - the send button
2 - the ip and
2 - image hosting but
2 - just as easily
2 - general file upload
2 - file upload hosting
2 - but if we
2 - to cover bandwidth
2 - a little too
2 - 1 out of
2 - be interested in
2 - it helps that
2 - and a number
2 - help support the
2 - value of bitcoins
2 - in small amounts
2 - for open source
2 - open source projects
2 - source projects to
2 - set one up
2 - i hope they
2 - by the same
2 - there were some
2 - a temporary solution
2 - when there are
2 - are enough static
2 - have a good
2 - preprogram a seed
2 - a seed list
2 - there are services
2 - are services like
2 - a minuscule amount
2 - minuscule amount of
2 - they can't just
2 - be something in
2 - them it would
2 - to pay for
2 - and avoid the
2 - avoid the limits
2 - to make them
2 - if we made
2 - php code for
2 - and run it
2 - like this the
2 - refer to the
2 - for more information
2 - there was some
2 - threads are processes
2 - of the whole
2 - on linux so
2 - there can be
2 - can be an
2 - similar to how
2 - of the payment
2 - and the full
2 - anything else i
2 - the utf-16 version
2 - the source of
2 - described in the
2 - in anticipation of
2 - without going through
2 - is utf-8 and
2 - on linux i
2 - i assume the
2 - read build-unix txt
2 - big dependencies but
2 - land square on
2 - to custom sizes
2 - using wxwidgets 2
2 - just want to
2 - get it working
2 - see that it's
2 - look like a
2 - but i had
2 - that do you
2 - the formula is
2 - and does not
2 - does not link
2 - init and shutdown
2 - into init cpp
2 - we only have
2 - the ui in
2 - ui in the
2 - link ui o
2 - fact that we
2 - still use a
2 - to run in
2 - and what it's
2 - how fast did
2 - ubuntu 9 10
2 - something about the
2 - it as such
2 - better than the
2 - than the old
2 - just a matter
2 - sudo apt-get install
2 - it's done it
2 - it with your
2 - 0 2 5
2 - it to make
2 - without having a
2 - to control it
2 - control it from
2 - the port is
2 - without any switches
2 - normally use json-rpc
2 - use json-rpc directly
2 - json-rpc directly not
2 - directly not command
2 - not command line
2 - for all the
2 - address you don't
2 - money sent to
2 - sent to that
2 - wallet if you
2 - you were to
2 - got a lot
2 - with 2 9
2 - 9 0 wxwidgets
2 - 0 wxwidgets 2
2 - 9 0 is
2 - 0 is utf-8
2 - have that problem
2 - it working on
2 - command line i
2 - every 2016 blocks
2 - lot easier to
2 - one of your
2 - of your bitcoin
2 - your bitcoin addresses
2 - bitcoin address is
2 - to wxwidgets 2
2 - to increase in
2 - the present value
2 - absence of a
2 - if the price
2 - can be made
2 - the other way
2 - value to be
2 - higher than the
2 - for new users
2 - new users to
2 - static ip address
2 - be sure to
2 - nodes that can
2 - now you should
2 - block generation is
2 - updated the svn
2 - in and we're
2 - when the program
2 - of the exe
2 - share locale langcode
2 - less than 1
2 - the next message
2 - from all the
2 - all the other
2 - i thought about
2 - as possible and
2 - per hour if
2 - be 10 times
2 - close to the
2 - set up your
2 - your nat to
2 - to that port
2 - the ip of
2 - from the first
2 - it doesn't use
2 - of computers for
2 - of them the
2 - 1 82 times
2 - ago it was
2 - of 21 million
2 - times bigger than
2 - a really huge
2 - really huge transaction
2 - to something like
2 - nodes if you're
2 - on karmic 64-bit
2 - and use the
2 - the download link
2 - to the sourceforge
2 - buildable on 64-bit
2 - the network are
2 - something is there
2 - it there's a
2 - the node that
2 - there's a 32-bit
2 - can be run
2 - on 64-bit ubuntu
2 - on 64-bit karmic
2 - 2 0 release
2 - there currently isn't
2 - currently isn't a
2 - but as a
2 - i checked the
2 - fine in wine
2 - 2 3 4
2 - node to connect
2 - one of these
2 - like 192 168
2 - 192 168 x
2 - 168 x x
2 - all the tor
2 - to create a
2 - on windows the
2 - go in a
2 - where the exe
2 - the exe is
2 - json-rpc and command
2 - and command line
2 - command line support
2 - so it shouldn't
2 - be too hard
2 - and there is
2 - there is one
2 - is used for
2 - larger than that
2 - million coins for
2 - a total of
2 - 8 decimal places
2 - change where the
2 - the decimal point
2 - same amount of
2 - you had 1
2 - you don't connect
2 - still figure it
2 - network is larger
2 - send by ip
2 - by ip the
2 - could use tor
2 - that you could
2 - over to the
2 - to the recipient's
2 - on 30 dec
2 - even if only
2 - running a node
2 - coins for the
2 - number of nodes
2 - successfully generate a
2 - irc servers ban
2 - make any changes
2 - be trying to
2 - as rix says
2 - rix says the
2 - doesn't use dns
2 - in proxy mode
2 - online so it
2 - it tries to
2 - a node it
2 - connections it won't
2 - it won't try
2 - won't try anything
2 - try anything over
2 - to that ip
2 - the transaction directly
2 - transaction directly to
2 - was received and
2 - since there is
2 - ahead of time
2 - pm or e-mail
2 - or e-mail me
2 - where i can
2 - i can send
2 - as an attachment
2 - committed a fix
2 - there was one
2 - we've been using
2 - the status number
2 - up i'm not
2 - build it yourself
2 - for an order
2 - the customer sends
2 - customer sends to
2 - software to do
2 - disk space and
2 - all the bitcoin
2 - now would be
2 - best way to
2 - to prove that
2 - a short message
2 - do it as
2 - for each payment
2 - it's just a
2 - are already spent
2 - they were spent
2 - on another computer
2 - the receiver would
2 - the status column
2 - changing it to
2 - get a little
2 - a little more
2 - and the recipient
2 - the time i
2 - wanted to find
2 - to find some
2 - find some way
2 - way to include
2 - the whole world
2 - what happens if
2 - happens if you
2 - of it the
2 - backup your wallet
2 - in one place
2 - transfer money out
2 - the list this
2 - thinking about that
2 - the network that
2 - a few places
2 - but it may
2 - and see what
2 - you can run
2 - on 64-bit linux
2 - address if you
2 - with the block
2 - the received transaction
2 - if the status
2 - min so it
2 - icon on the

2 - certain number of
2 - the byzantine generals
2 - byzantine generals problem
2 - and how to
2 - use it and
2 - make it look
2 - at bitcoin org
2 - a different key
2 - be anonymous the
2 - to backup your
2 - let anyone who
2 - anyone who has
2 - who has your
2 - we'll be able
2 - an admin account
2 - maybe it's just
2 - you say there
2 - https sourceforge net
2 - control over the
2 - it i went
2 - you can figure
2 - the links to
2 - login page to
2 - page to load
2 - try to get
2 - as possible i
2 - it covers up
2 - covers up the
2 - you make the
2 - the homepage it
2 - but i still
2 - haven't been able
2 - the sourceforge login
2 - the design on
2 - design on the
2 - help if there
2 - want to be
2 - the benefit of
2 - money for your
2 - for your computer's
2 - for some virtual
2 - there won't be
2 - to be done
2 - it's a pain
2 - big and hard
2 - hard to build
2 - now that i
2 - that i think
2 - i think about
2 - in the number
2 - by default was
2 - the key to
2 - the new version
2 - on by default
2 - do a linux
2 - do it we
2 - might give us
2 - that need to
2 - backup wallet dat
2 - it's good to
2 - it was only
2 - what was the
2 - was the problem
2 - problem with the
2 - you could send
2 - to take another
2 - was the first
2 - in the registry
2 - explanation that satisfies
2 - got it i
2 - startup folder code
2 - don't see any
2 - wonder if we
2 - code and see
2 - flush wallet dat
2 - the transaction logs
2 - linked after it
2 - on windows i
2 - i may be
2 - don't look like
2 - know what else
2 - to look for
2 - support functions i
2 - in util cpp
2 - can you make
2 - uninstall the startup
2 - startup folder icon
2 - upload it to
2 - and see how
2 - see how they
2 - in util h
2 - a while before
2 - can be a
2 - be a no-op
2 - on linux openssl
2 - do on the
2 - that i can
2 - i can do
2 - do some testing
2 - when you've got
2 - we could get
2 - the same account
2 - i suppose the
2 - nodes that already
2 - the mailing list
2 - i fixed a
2 - i'm currently using
2 - on windows and
2 - ran it and
2 - instead of having
2 - i'm pretty sure
2 - i think all
2 - so it should
2 - or a link
2 - to be completely
2 - be completely stealth
2 - now that the
2 - full blown forum
2 - blown forum software
2 - forum feature is
2 - the forum tab
2 - forum tab on
2 - we can get
2 - a free forum
2 - the ui thread
2 - it turns out
2 - have to assume
2 - run it again
2 - closing the socket
2 - wonder if the
2 - the mail server
2 - you can download
2 - receive the blocks
2 - to start downloading
2 - for several hours
2 - take to start
2 - there is never
2 - any need to
2 - see what happened
2 - of the database
2 - won't let you
2 - to cope with
2 - for the best
2 - be the only
2 - the same problem
2 - to make some
2 - only if all
2 - to get an
2 - each time the
2 - if the socket
2 - to send and
2 - the zombie sockets
2 - they deal with
2 - to the send
2 - the socket is
2 - at the top
2 - the solution is
2 - the thread the
2 - have to rely
2 - the difference is
2 - your linux machine
2 - the zombie problem
2 - to refer to
2 - the forum doesn't
2 - the php code
2 - the dat file
2 - a wallet dat
2 - cost of bandwidth
2 - want to give
2 - see a way
2 - a long operation
2 - the initial download
2 - i've been able
2 - db open close
2 - so if i
2 - able to use
2 - forum bitcoin org
2 - i had been
2 - had been wondering
2 - the current bitcoin
2 - current bitcoin org
2 - those who need
2 - the search engines
2 - bitcoin org dns
2 - keep working on
2 - has had time
2 - we can switch
2 - switch to the
2 - and release the
2 - htaccess file which
2 - all this is
2 - here's the planned
2 - change the forum
2 - future reference the
2 - can't change the
2 - the forum link
2 - like a bank
2 - to give the
2 - transaction fee of
2 - the first 1kb
2 - have to explain
2 - transaction will be
2 - the block size
2 - the transaction for
2 - on the sender's
2 - the sender's side
2 - time has passed
2 - to a lot
2 - keep the network
2 - forum at http
2 - block download we
2 - download we also
2 - many thanks to
2 - to martti sirius-m
2 - martti sirius-m for
2 - all his development
2 - his development work
2 - development work and
2 - work and to
2 - and to new
2 - do all that
2 - of having the
2 - it up to
2 - is one of
2 - and the others
2 - easy to cash
2 - be easy for
2 - up with and
2 - in one direction
2 - out what the
2 - guess we could
2 - to be delivered
2 - that they could
2 - get a small
2 - cash out and
2 - a few more
2 - i made some
2 - it into your
2 - are going to
2 - on the first
2 - 3 release i
2 - couldn't have gotten
2 - the type of
2 - unsigned int 1
2 - would you be
2 - and a half
2 - you receive it
2 - got a donation
2 - to remain anonymous
2 - no central authority
2 - central authority to
2 - transaction filter tabs
2 - get it at
2 - user accounts on
2 - accounts on drupal
2 - that if you're
2 - make sure there's
2 - i think our
2 - think our problem
2 - our problem may
2 - may be that
2 - be that we
2 - we have forum
2 - have forum notifications
2 - forum notifications on
2 - notifications on like
2 - on like e-mail
2 - like e-mail you
2 - e-mail you when
2 - you when you
2 - you receive a
2 - receive a pm
2 - a pm but
2 - pm but we
2 - don't have e-mail
2 - have e-mail verification
2 - e-mail verification of
2 - verification of new
2 - of new accounts
2 - new accounts can
2 - accounts can someone
2 - can someone put
2 - someone put someone
2 - put someone else's
2 - someone else's e-mail
2 - else's e-mail address
2 - e-mail address without
2 - address without verifying
2 - verifying it then
2 - it then have
2 - then have stuff
2 - have stuff sent
2 - stuff sent there
2 - sent there we
2 - there we need
2 - need to stop
2 - to stop that
2 - stop that right
2 - that right away
2 - right away before
2 - away before it
2 - before it gets
2 - it gets used
2 - gets used for
2 - used for something
2 - for something bad
2 - something bad either
2 - bad either disallow
2 - either disallow all
2 - disallow all notification
2 - all notification or
2 - notification or make
2 - or make sure
2 - make sure e-mail
2 - sure e-mail addresses
2 - e-mail addresses are
2 - addresses are verified
2 - are verified i'm
2 - verified i'm more
2 - i'm more inclined
2 - more inclined to
2 - inclined to disallow
2 - to disallow notifications
2 - disallow notifications or
2 - notifications or anything
2 - or anything where
2 - anything where the
2 - where the forum
2 - the forum sends
2 - forum sends you
2 - sends you e-mail
2 - you e-mail i
2 - e-mail i kinda
2 - i kinda like
2 - kinda like not
2 - like not requiring
2 - not requiring e-mail
2 - requiring e-mail verification
2 - verification but if
2 - but if that's
2 - if that's the
2 - make sure we
2 - sure we don't
2 - we don't send
2 - don't send e-mails
2 - send e-mails to
2 - e-mails to un-verified
2 - to un-verified addresses
2 - un-verified addresses then
2 - addresses then we
2 - then we could
2 - do that if
2 - that if we
2 - if we request
2 - we request to
2 - request to get
2 - to get off
2 - get off of
2 - off of pbl
2 - of pbl we'd
2 - pbl we'd better
2 - we'd better make
2 - make sure we've
2 - sure we've got
2 - got the problem
2 - the problem secured

1 - it getwork does
1 - getwork does the

1 - byte-reversing midstate data
1 - and hash1 are

1 - you pass data
1 - pass data back
1 - data back still

1 - still big-endian so
1 - big-endian so you
1 - so you work
1 - you work in
1 - work in big-endian
1 - in big-endian and

1 - data that is
1 - that is passed
1 - is passed to
1 - passed to the
1 - to the functions
1 - the functions you

1 - can take midstate
1 - take midstate data
1 - and hash1 put

1 - put them in
1 - them in 16-byte
1 - in 16-byte aligned
1 - 16-byte aligned buffers
1 - aligned buffers and

1 - use pdata instead
1 - pdata instead of

1 - it reduces best
1 - reduces best chain
1 - best chain work
1 - chain work to

1 - the osx build
1 - osx build does
1 - build does it

1 - sha-256 didn't work
1 - didn't work correctly

1 - figures out how
1 - fix it we
1 - it we can
1 - we can re-enable
1 - can re-enable it
1 - re-enable it then

1 - field length array
1 - length array there
1 - array there was
1 - was a cleaner

1 - serialize arrays directly
1 - arrays directly but
1 - directly but msvc6
1 - but msvc6 couldn't
1 - msvc6 couldn't do
1 - couldn't do it
1 - and i wanted
1 - wanted to keep
1 - to keep compatibility
1 - keep compatibility with

1 - with msvc6 at
1 - msvc6 at that
1 - that time we
1 - time we don't
1 - we don't support
1 - don't support msvc6
1 - support msvc6 anymore
1 - msvc6 anymore because
1 - anymore because we
1 - because we use
1 - we use something
1 - use something in
1 - in boost that
1 - boost that doesn't
1 - that doesn't we
1 - doesn't we lost
1 - we lost support
1 - lost support for
1 - support for it
1 - for it after
1 - it after 0
1 - 2 0 maybe
1 - 0 maybe someday
1 - maybe someday i'll
1 - someday i'll swap
1 - i'll swap in
1 - in the clean
1 - the clean way
1 - clean way that
1 - way that just
1 - that just knows
1 - just knows how
1 - to serialize fixed
1 - serialize fixed length
1 - fixed length arrays
1 - length arrays without
1 - arrays without wrapping
1 - without wrapping them
1 - wrapping them in
1 - them in flatdata

1 - anyone confirm if
1 - confirm if json-rpc
1 - if json-rpc over
1 - json-rpc over http
1 - over http is
1 - http is supposed
1 - supposed to use
1 - to use status
1 - use status 500
1 - status 500 if
1 - 500 if the
1 - if the reply
1 - the reply is
1 - reply is an
1 - error reply i
1 - reply i can't
1 - where i picked
1 - i picked that
1 - picked that up
1 - that up maybe
1 - up maybe it's
1 - maybe it's wrong
1 - it's wrong it
1 - wrong it seems
1 - seems like 200
1 - like 200 would
1 - 200 would make
1 - would make more
1 - make more sense
1 - more sense unless
1 - sense unless there's
1 - unless there's something
1 - with the mechanics
1 - the mechanics of
1 - mechanics of the
1 - of the http
1 - the http request
1 - http request itself
1 - request itself and
1 - itself and maybe
1 - and maybe that's
1 - maybe that's what
1 - what it said
1 - it said and
1 - said and i
1 - and i forgot
1 - i forgot and
1 - forgot and spread
1 - and spread 500
1 - spread 500 to
1 - 500 to all
1 - to all error
1 - all error responses
1 - error responses obviously
1 - responses obviously it's
1 - obviously it's a
1 - it's a bug
1 - a bug that
1 - bug that it
1 - that it repeats
1 - it repeats the
1 - repeats the header
1 - the header i
1 - header i was
1 - trying to follow
1 - to follow the
1 - follow the 1
1 - the 1 0
1 - 1 0 spec
1 - 0 spec it
1 - spec it called
1 - it called for
1 - called for multiple
1 - for multiple invocation
1 - multiple invocation i
1 - invocation i think
1 - think they mean
1 - they mean it's
1 - mean it's like
1 - it's like this
1 - like this but
1 - this but i'm
1 - not sure i
1 - sure i can't
1 - where i think
1 - think i saw
1 - i saw that
1 - saw that it's
1 - supposed to send
1 - send back http
1 - back http status
1 - 500 for an
1 - for an error
1 - error reply if
1 - reply if it
1 - it contains multiple
1 - contains multiple responses
1 - multiple responses and
1 - responses and one
1 - and one is
1 - one is an
1 - an error i
1 - error i wonder
1 - if that makes
1 - makes the status
1 - the status 500
1 - 500 for the
1 - whole thing i
1 - thing i guess
1 - i guess so
1 - guess so maybe
1 - it should always
1 - should always return
1 - always return 200
1 - return 200 i
1 - 200 i think
1 - i think someone
1 - think someone sounded
1 - someone sounded like
1 - sounded like the
1 - like the 500
1 - the 500 might
1 - 500 might be
1 - might be causing
1 - be causing a
1 - causing a problem
1 - a problem this
1 - problem this probably
1 - this probably gets
1 - probably gets fixed
1 - gets fixed after
1 - fixed after 0
1 - 3 3 until
1 - 3 until then
1 - until then just
1 - then just use
1 - just use single
1 - use single invocation
1 - single invocation i
1 - invocation i wonder
1 - wonder if any
1 - if any json-rpc
1 - any json-rpc package
1 - json-rpc package even
1 - package even supports
1 - even supports multiple
1 - supports multiple invocation
1 - multiple invocation probably
1 - invocation probably not
1 - probably not it
1 - not it would
1 - we could pin
1 - could pin down
1 - pin down better
1 - down better how
1 - better how multiple-invocation
1 - how multiple-invocation is
1 - multiple-invocation is supposed
1 - to work if
1 - work if at
1 - at all before
1 - all before trying
1 - before trying to
1 - trying to fix
1 - fix it and
1 - it and whether
1 - and whether returning
1 - whether returning http
1 - returning http status
1 - 500 for error
1 - for error response
1 - error response is
1 - response is right
1 - is right i
1 - don't think authentication
1 - think authentication should
1 - should be disabled
1 - be disabled by
1 - default if there's
1 - if there's no
1 - there's no conf
1 - no conf file
1 - conf file or

1 - rpcpassword but what
1 - but what if
1 - what if it
1 - it contains rpcpassword
1 - contains rpcpassword i
1 - rpcpassword i can
1 - can see both
1 - see both points
1 - both points what
1 - points what if
1 - if the programmer

1 - country cuts itself
1 - cuts itself off
1 - the world the

1 - the world is
1 - world is the
1 - is the larger
1 - the larger segment
1 - larger segment if
1 - segment if you're
1 - if you're in
1 - smaller segment you
1 - segment you should
1 - you should assume
1 - should assume nothing
1 - assume nothing is
1 - nothing is confirmed
1 - is confirmed thanks
1 - confirmed thanks for
1 - thanks for finding
1 - for finding that
1 - finding that we
1 - that we switched
1 - we switched from

1 - our first mac
1 - first mac release
1 - mac release so
1 - release so please
1 - test it i
1 - it i reduced
1 - i reduced max
1 - reduced max outbound
1 - max outbound connections
1 - to 8 in
1 - 8 in rc4
1 - in rc4 15
1 - rc4 15 was
1 - 15 was way
1 - was way more
1 - way more than
1 - more than we
1 - than we needed
1 - we needed for
1 - needed for redundancy
1 - for redundancy 8
1 - redundancy 8 is
1 - still plenty of
1 - plenty of redundancy
1 - of redundancy as
1 - redundancy as the
1 - as the nodes
1 - the nodes upgrade
1 - nodes upgrade to
1 - this version this
1 - version this will
1 - this will cut
1 - will cut in
1 - in half the
1 - half the number
1 - of connections that
1 - connections that inbound
1 - that inbound accepting
1 - accepting nodes get
1 - nodes get if
1 - get if anyone
1 - if anyone wants
1 - anyone wants more
1 - wants more than
1 - than 8 connections
1 - 8 connections they
1 - connections they can
1 - they can open
1 - can open port
1 - open port 8333
1 - 8333 on their
1 - on their firewall
1 - their firewall ok
1 - firewall ok back
1 - ok back to
1 - 0 3 then
1 - 3 then please
1 - then please download
1 - please download rc4
1 - download rc4 and
1 - rc4 and check
1 - check it over
1 - it over as
1 - over as soon
1 - as possible i'd
1 - possible i'd like
1 - like to release
1 - release it soon
1 - it soon other
1 - soon other than
1 - than the version
1 - version number change
1 - number change which
1 - change which included
1 - which included changes
1 - included changes in
1 - changes in readme
1 - txt and setup
1 - and setup nsi
1 - setup nsi i
1 - nsi i reduced
1 - reduced the maximum
1 - the maximum number
1 - maximum number of
1 - number of outbound
1 - of outbound connections
1 - to 8 so
1 - 8 so nodes
1 - so nodes that
1 - that accept inbound
1 - accept inbound don't
1 - inbound don't get
1 - don't get too
1 - too many connections
1 - many connections 15
1 - connections 15 was
1 - 15 was a
1 - lot more than
1 - more than needed
1 - than needed 8
1 - needed 8 is
1 - still plenty for
1 - plenty for redundancy
1 - for redundancy links
1 - redundancy links removed
1 - links removed 0
1 - removed 0 3
1 - 0 3 is
1 - 3 is now
1 - is now released
1 - now released so
1 - released so go
1 - so go to
1 - go to to
1 - to to download
1 - to download it
1 - download it it
1 - is but generating
1 - but generating is
1 - generating is more
1 - more than twice
1 - than twice as
1 - twice as slow
1 - as slow thanks
1 - for the feedback
1 - the feedback on
1 - feedback on this
1 - this one thing
1 - one thing we
1 - thing we could
1 - could do is
1 - do is lower
1 - is lower the
1 - lower the outbound
1 - the outbound connections
1 - 15 to 10
1 - 10 or maybe
1 - or maybe even
1 - maybe even 5
1 - even 5 the
1 - 5 the choice
1 - the choice of
1 - choice of 15
1 - of 15 was
1 - 15 was arbitrary
1 - was arbitrary it
1 - arbitrary it just
1 - it just needs
1 - to be enough
1 - be enough for
1 - enough for redundancy
1 - for redundancy and
1 - redundancy and fast
1 - and fast exponential
1 - fast exponential propagation
1 - exponential propagation of
1 - propagation of messages
1 - of messages 10
1 - messages 10 would
1 - 10 would still
1 - still be plenty
1 - be plenty 5
1 - plenty 5 should
1 - 5 should be
1 - be fine 10
1 - fine 10 is
1 - 10 is good
1 - is good as
1 - as a nice
1 - a nice round
1 - nice round number
1 - round number so
1 - number so users
1 - so users can
1 - see that it
1 - that it stopped
1 - it stopped intentionally
1 - stopped intentionally it
1 - intentionally it would
1 - help to implement
1 - to implement upnp
1 - implement upnp so
1 - upnp so there
1 - so there would
1 - be more inbound
1 - more inbound accepting
1 - accepting nodes your
1 - nodes your number
1 - of connections is
1 - connections is the
1 - is the ratio
1 - ratio of inbound
1 - of inbound accepting
1 - accepting nodes to
1 - nodes to out-only
1 - to out-only times
1 - out-only times 15
1 - times 15 we
1 - 15 we need
1 - need to encourage
1 - to encourage more
1 - encourage more people
1 - more people to
1 - people to accept
1 - to accept inbound
1 - inbound connections i
1 - connections i will
1 - i will implement
1 - will implement a
1 - implement a feature

1 - what nodes have
1 - nodes have recently

1 - and some fixes
1 - some fixes to
1 - fixes to support
1 - to support wxwidgets
1 - support wxwidgets 2
1 - 9 0 there
1 - 0 there was
1 - was one compile
1 - one compile error
1 - compile error in

1 - that i fixed
1 - i fixed for
1 - fixed for 64-bit
1 - for 64-bit the
1 - 64-bit the rest
1 - of the 64-bit
1 - the 64-bit compile
1 - 64-bit compile errors
1 - compile errors i
1 - errors i was
1 - i was getting
1 - was getting were
1 - getting were in
1 - were in wxwidgets
1 - in wxwidgets 2
1 - 8 9 so
1 - 9 so i
1 - so i started
1 - i started working
1 - started working on
1 - working on supporting
1 - on supporting wxwidgets
1 - supporting wxwidgets 2
1 - is utf-8 we've
1 - utf-8 we've been
1 - been using the
1 - using the ansi
1 - the ansi version
1 - ansi version of
1 - 8 9 in
1 - 9 in anticipation
1 - anticipation of wxwidgets
1 - of wxwidgets utf-8
1 - wxwidgets utf-8 support
1 - utf-8 support i
1 - support i compiled
1 - i compiled and
1 - compiled and ran
1 - and ran on
1 - ran on 64-bit
1 - 64-bit ubuntu 9
1 - 9 10 karmic
1 - 10 karmic i
1 - karmic i think
1 - the only bug
1 - only bug left
1 - bug left is
1 - left is where
1 - is where the
1 - where the status
1 - status number is
1 - number is mashed
1 - is mashed up
1 - mashed up i'm
1 - not sure why
1 - sure why i
1 - why i have
1 - have to suspect
1 - to suspect it's
1 - suspect it's a
1 - it's a utf-8
1 - a utf-8 thing
1 - utf-8 thing but
1 - thing but no
1 - but no idea
1 - idea how that
1 - could happen haven't
1 - happen haven't looked
1 - haven't looked into
1 - looked into it
1 - into it build-unix
1 - it build-unix txt
1 - build-unix txt is
1 - txt is updated
1 - is updated and
1 - updated and two
1 - and two makefiles
1 - two makefiles on
1 - makefiles on svn
1 - on svn unfortunately
1 - svn unfortunately there's
1 - unfortunately there's still
1 - there's still no
1 - still no debian
1 - no debian package
1 - debian package for
1 - package for either
1 - for either version
1 - either version of
1 - of wxwidgets we
1 - wxwidgets we use
1 - we use they
1 - use they only
1 - have the wchar
1 - the wchar unicode
1 - wchar unicode version
1 - unicode version of
1 - 2 8 which
1 - 8 which is
1 - is a disaster
1 - a disaster because
1 - disaster because wchar
1 - because wchar wxstring
1 - wchar wxstring doesn't
1 - wxstring doesn't convert
1 - doesn't convert to
1 - convert to std
1 - to std string
1 - std string we
1 - string we use
1 - we use either
1 - use either ansi
1 - either ansi wxwidgets
1 - ansi wxwidgets 2
1 - 2 8 or
1 - 8 or wxwidgets
1 - or wxwidgets 2
1 - 2 9 so
1 - 9 so you
1 - so you still
1 - get it and
1 - it and build
1 - and build it
1 - it yourself the
1 - yourself the recommended
1 - the recommended ways

1 - granularity if typical
1 - if typical prices
1 - typical prices become
1 - prices become small
1 - become small for
1 - small for example
1 - example if 0
1 - if 0 001
1 - 001 is worth
1 - is worth 1
1 - worth 1 euro
1 - 1 euro then
1 - euro then it
1 - then it might
1 - might be easier
1 - be easier to
1 - easier to change
1 - to change where
1 - where the decimal
1 - decimal point is

1 - status of blocks
1 - of blocks should
1 - blocks should say
1 - should say unconfirmed
1 - say unconfirmed all
1 - unconfirmed all the
1 - the way up
1 - way up to

1 - to maturity 119
1 - maturity 119 unconfirmed
1 - 119 unconfirmed then
1 - unconfirmed then 120
1 - then 120 blocks
1 - 120 blocks instead
1 - blocks instead the
1 - instead the meaning
1 - the meaning of
1 - meaning of the
1 - the number isn't
1 - number isn't as
1 - isn't as strong
1 - as strong for
1 - strong for blocks
1 - for blocks as
1 - blocks as for
1 - as for transactions
1 - for transactions i
1 - transactions i think
1 - an improvement not
1 - improvement not to
1 - not to count
1 - to count one's
1 - count one's own
1 - one's own blocks
1 - own blocks as
1 - blocks as confirmations
1 - as confirmations a
1 - confirmations a drawback
1 - a drawback would
1 - drawback would be

1 - the status numbers
1 - status numbers shown
1 - numbers shown by
1 - shown by different
1 - by different nodes
1 - different nodes would
1 - nodes would not

1 - countdown on blocks
1 - on blocks either
1 - blocks either a
1 - either a lighter
1 - a lighter option
1 - lighter option would

1 - special case only
1 - case only if
1 - if all confirmations
1 - all confirmations are
1 - confirmations are your
1 - are your own
1 - your own i
1 - own i fixed
1 - few places i
