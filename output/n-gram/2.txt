30 - you want
29 - may be
29 - they can
29 - the software
29 - how to
29 - working on
29 - bitcoin is
29 - so you
29 - there is
29 - if i
28 - a node
28 - is that
28 - it the
28 - but the
28 - can get
27 - the rest
27 - the last
27 - use the
27 - has to
27 - the whole
27 - get the

27 - that you
27 - even if
27 - the system
26 - other nodes
26 - version of
26 - use it
26 - make a
26 - it with
26 - where the
26 - not sure
26 - about the

26 - has been
26 - the best
26 - of it
26 - the status
26 - so i
25 - to connect
25 - don't know
25 - and a
25 - was a
25 - amount of
25 - to generate
25 - the money
25 - easy to
25 - think of
25 - that's the
25 - to run
25 - i was
25 - the linux
25 - we don't
25 - bitcoin addresses
24 - not be
24 - we have
24 - use a

24 - ip address
24 - not to
24 - be used
24 - we could
24 - i can't
24 - 0 01
24 - you should
24 - block download
24 - it if
24 - is an
23 - if there's
23 - in this
23 - less than
23 - that is
23 - into a
23 - the proof-of-work
23 - doesn't have
23 - in case
23 - the address
23 - you need
23 - it for
23 - set up
23 - as long
23 - that we
23 - hard to
23 - a bitcoin
23 - of them
23 - that's a
23 - it does
23 - a problem
23 - just a
23 - we should
22 - send to
22 - up to
22 - it on
22 - in that
22 - if there
22 - what the
22 - i've been
22 - to go
22 - so the
22 - that it's
22 - to know
22 - out the
22 - to add
22 - that can
22 - i made
22 - to 0
22 - initial block
22 - right now
21 - is still
21 - make the
21 - be the
21 - to receive
21 - for now
21 - a long
21 - the number
21 - the world
21 - see the
21 - if a
21 - you would
21 - can't be
21 - to take
21 - to change
21 - if someone
20 - transaction to
20 - to start
20 - the 0
20 - it will
20 - using the
20 - might be
20 - does not
20 - not a
20 - upgrade to
20 - of bitcoin
20 - 9 0
20 - it as
20 - a different
20 - to try
20 - a small
20 - i haven't
20 - see if
20 - up the
20 - to svn
20 - the program
20 - with it
20 - like to
20 - most of
20 - would still
20 - the code
20 - like the
20 - it might
19 - the right
19 - it may
19 - and i
19 - and you
19 - don't want
19 - is there
19 - the user
19 - now that
19 - know if
19 - it can't
19 - the data
19 - for each
19 - then it
19 - something like
19 - it'll be
19 - blk dat
19 - are you
19 - then you
19 - that could
19 - kind of
19 - is it
19 - that i
19 - 2 8
19 - you think
19 - the difficulty
19 - the initial
18 - is in
18 - only be
18 - get it
18 - know what
18 - be nice
18 - but not
18 - by ip
18 - still be
18 - it in
18 - a big
18 - it so
18 - you get
18 - long as
18 - to work
18 - but if
18 - a while
18 - is now
18 - the ui
18 - i uploaded
18 - that was
18 - for that
18 - it gets
18 - it i
18 - like a
18 - in it
18 - look at
18 - to find
18 - was the
18 - on your
18 - you send
18 - would only
17 - to set
17 - the file
17 - can only
17 - to check
17 - the public
17 - before the
17 - chance of
17 - address and
17 - for this
17 - that way
17 - can use
17 - the future
17 - the old
17 - and then
17 - thanks for
17 - of your
17 - does it
17 - i had
17 - it looks
17 - the svn
17 - looks like
17 - to that
17 - access to
16 - check for
16 - transaction fees
16 - block is
16 - when it
16 - using it
16 - at all
16 - you to
16 - where you
16 - when i
16 - hash of
16 - your own
16 - 0 0
16 - run it
16 - and see
16 - changes to
16 - it only
16 - i should
16 - i didn't
16 - a single

15 - what it
15 - the chain
15 - it back
15 - through the
15 - part of
15 - at once
15 - the ip
15 - but they
15 - the one
15 - 1 3
15 - should have
15 - users to
15 - to put
15 - it it
15 - per block
15 - there will
15 - you use
15 - the way
15 - you still
15 - data is
15 - way for

15 - i added
15 - the site
15 - figure out
15 - the design
15 - keep the

15 - 3 1
15 - a trusted
15 - 4 years
14 - the command
14 - the size
14 - is just
14 - need a
14 - the order
14 - the latest
14 - it from

14 - next block
14 - can still
14 - a certain
14 - generate a

14 - think it
14 - the total
14 - option to
14 - the hash
14 - be very
14 - do a
14 - did it
14 - had to
14 - a more
14 - i just
14 - so they
14 - transaction the
14 - as an
14 - to implement
14 - i believe
14 - so that
14 - you were
14 - i see
14 - 0 unconfirmed
14 - the original
14 - they have
14 - network to
14 - your wallet
14 - that doesn't
14 - keep it
14 - the switch
14 - the amount
14 - i hope
14 - code to
14 - it uses
14 - the cpu
14 - network nodes
14 - an error
14 - it works
14 - it out
14 - it that
14 - can do
14 - the blocks
14 - to buy
14 - the cost
14 - transaction is
14 - 000 coins
13 - time the
13 - is only
13 - proof of
13 - the previous
13 - so far
13 - needed to
13 - to it
13 - an attacker
13 - but it's
13 - way the
13 - it at
13 - this would
13 - in 0
13 - bitcoin and
13 - it it's
13 - there would
13 - code is
13 - that's not
13 - their own
13 - then the
13 - be possible
13 - to build
13 - the case
13 - you know
13 - with this
13 - to pay
13 - and get
13 - it's only
13 - linux build
13 - from a
13 - still have
13 - them to
13 - of that
13 - run a
13 - on their
13 - problem with
13 - a 0
13 - nodes to
13 - be something
13 - linux version
13 - the price
13 - problem is
13 - and not
13 - the json-rpc
13 - won't be
13 - the error
13 - think the
13 - same time
13 - up with
13 - to their
13 - thanks to
13 - 3 10
13 - read the

12 - all transactions
12 - to one
12 - to your

12 - only one
12 - i know
12 - transactions are
12 - it must
12 - it seems
12 - to support

9 - i wonder
9 - a backup
9 - be done
9 - what you
9 - enough that

8 - longest chain
8 - it but

8 - any time
8 - at this
8 - next time
8 - we would
8 - maybe it
8 - tcatm's 4-way
8 - made it
8 - might have
8 - to protect
8 - check if
8 - this version

8 - change to

8 - blkindex dat
8 - although it
8 - and all
8 - it's more
8 - no way
8 - them in

8 - i wanted

8 - soon as

8 - a free
8 - just need
8 - look like
8 - fix it
8 - is needed
8 - because you
8 - right away
8 - sure you
8 - see how
8 - with 4way
8 - also have
8 - it says
8 - you haven't
8 - have any
8 - if you've
8 - while the
8 - the threshold
8 - even though
8 - keep a
8 - in some
8 - them the
8 - think i
8 - what happened
8 - by bitcoin
8 - reason for
8 - idea to
8 - i did
8 - per day
8 - the standard
8 - option is
8 - can you
8 - that they
8 - the 4way
8 - also be
8 - the alert
8 - i'd rather
8 - i thought
8 - is very
8 - some of
8 - is better
8 - nodes can
8 - with your
8 - bad chain
8 - the node
8 - from that
8 - makefile unix
8 - it then
8 - the idea
8 - the help
8 - that has
8 - bit of
8 - 0 i
8 - on ubuntu
8 - 3 4
8 - or not
8 - pay for
8 - the customer
8 - type of
8 - a system
8 - just to
8 - money and
8 - of gold
8 - i suppose
8 - worry about
8 - for your
8 - each time
8 - would get
8 - the middle
8 - support the
8 - minimize to
8 - the sourceforge
8 - of time
8 - have that
8 - blocks the
8 - difficulty is
8 - a password
8 - server or
8 - and also
8 - about how
8 - or at
8 - what do
8 - on bitcoin
8 - got it
8 - to create
8 - it's in
8 - new bitcoin
8 - proof-of-work difficulty
8 - it needs
8 - system is
8 - there's nothing
8 - cpu time
8 - generate coins
8 - too many
8 - the p2p
8 - circulation is
8 - 21 million
8 - million coins
8 - ip and
8 - the merchant

7 - ways to

7 - can just
7 - transactions the

7 - the possibility
7 - the incentive
7 - you are
7 - now you
7 - to bitcoin
7 - bitcoin the

7 - things like

5 - asm sha-256
5 - know about

2 - section 2
2 - links to

2 - satoshi account
2 - it covers
2 - covers up
2 - homepage it
2 - sounds really
2 - haven't been
2 - sourceforge login
2 - design on
2 - and with
2 - testing when
2 - busy with

2 - new ones
2 - ones are
2 - you'll have
2 - currency to
2 - benefit of
2 - transaction size
2 - an amount
2 - buy bitcoins
2 - would add
2 - confidence in
2 - other purposes
2 - some virtual
2 - currencies like
2 - on with
2 - an ebay
2 - site with
2 - sellers can
2 - there won't
2 - until later
2 - by hand
2 - first you
2 - i've had
2 - org so
2 - glad that
2 - that worked
2 - big and
2 - take out
2 - default was
2 - org and
2 - on by
2 - a linux
2 - that extra
2 - might give
2 - page that
2 - bug in
2 - and feedback
2 - backup wallet
2 - testing and
2 - take another
2 - the registry
2 - problem it's
2 - simplistic explanation
2 - explanation that
2 - checked in
2 - folder code
2 - code before
2 - it not
2 - it's possible
2 - out because
2 - little details
2 - tend to
2 - flush wallet
2 - the setup
2 - yet i
2 - that stuff
2 - stuff in
2 - linked after
2 - get another
2 - soon and
2 - don't look
2 - net in
2 - google search
2 - and building
2 - standard c
2 - is which
2 - send recv
2 - which i
2 - support functions
2 - functions i
2 - used more
2 - it btw
2 - uninstall the
2 - folder icon
2 - right it's
2 - solution i
2 - how they
2 - all my
2 - overhaul of
2 - while before
2 - came across
2 - and db
2 - a no-op
2 - linux openssl
2 - some testing
2 - same account
2 - suppose the

1 - setting this

1 - exactly is
1 - this an

1 - environment where

1 - n transactions
1 - transactions history
1 - history it's
1 - do payment
1 - payment detection
1 - detection the

1 - gavin could
1 - could listtransactions
1 - listtransactions have
1 - to list
1 - list transactions
1 - all accounts
1 - accounts i'm
1 - interface could
1 - be maybe
1 - maybe listtransactions
1 - listtransactions json
1 - json null
1 - null type
1 - type count
1 - line though
1 - good solution
1 - interface that's
1 - problem maybe
1 - maybe special
1 - case like
1 - is everyone
1 - sure no
1 - no user
1 - create account
1 - name i
1 - how that's
1 - track with
1 - with transactions
1 - with gavin
1 - gavin about
1 - about whitelisting
1 - whitelisting when
1 - realized how
1 - how quickly
1 - quickly new
1 - types can
1 - added that's
1 - possible pubkey
1 - pubkey pubkey
1 - pubkey can
1 - be 33
1 - 33 to
1 - to 120
1 - 120 bytes
1 - bytes i
1 - also support
1 - third transaction
1 - type for
1 - for timestamp
1 - timestamp hash
1 - hash sized
1 - sized arbitrary
1 - arbitrary data
1 - data there's
1 - point not
1 - having one
1 - one since
1 - tell nodes
1 - bother to
1 - it new
1 - transaction templates
1 - templates can
1 - added as
1 - needed within
1 - of gpu
1 - gpu power
1 - power that
1 - accepts and
1 - and works
1 - it network
1 - network support
1 - support will
1 - be thorough
1 - thorough there'll
1 - enough clients
1 - clients who
1 - who understand
1 - and interpret
1 - interpret the
1 - transaction timestamp
1 - timestamp hashes
1 - hashes are
1 - still already
1 - possible if
1 - actual application
1 - application like
1 - like bitdns
1 - bitdns getting
1 - actually start
1 - start inserting
1 - inserting hashes
1 - hashes we
1 - always add
1 - transaction template
1 - template for
1 - for timestamps
1 - timestamps i
1 - like hal
1 - hal finney's
1 - finney's idea
1 - for user-friendly
1 - user-friendly timestamping
1 - timestamping convert

1 - i'm talking
1 - about additional
1 - additional pitfalls
1 - pitfalls from
1 - from listtransactions
1 - when used
1 - used this
1 - op's example
1 - of listtransactions
1 - listtransactions account
1 - account count
1 - count 10
1 - 10 txid
1 - txid seems
1 - to imply
1 - imply and
1 - they pass
1 - pass in
1 - last txid
1 - txid of
1 - previous call
1 - to listtransactions
1 - listtransactions they
1 - transaction more
1 - once which
1 - double-count payments
1 - payments if
1 - don't maintain
1 - maintain your

1 - seem right
1 - seems tailor
1 - tailor made
1 - certain obvious
1 - obvious way
1 - a non-obvious
1 - non-obvious trap
1 - trap suppose
1 - suppose both
1 - spends are

1 - you pass

1 - patch it
1 - and call
1 - getwork i
1 - use pdata
1 - pdata instead

1 - 64 so

1 - is little

1 - as how

1 - started hardcoding

1 - here this
1 - thread seems

1 - a pre-generated

1 - was starting
1 - same idea
1 - idea you
1 - said nelisky
1 - nelisky how
1 - that locks
1 - wallet flushes
1 - flushes it
1 - it copies
1 - copies wallet
1 - location you
1 - you specified
1 - specified then
1 - then unlocks
1 - smaller project
1 - project than
1 - the pooled
1 - pooled keys
1 - keys so
1 - first what's
1 - simplest portable
1 - portable way
1 - copy a

1 - does removing
1 - removing make

1 - it weren't
1 - weren't for
1 - those it
1 - to reorg
1 - reorg all
1 - block svn
1 - 139 does
1 - basic check
1 - after loading
1 - loading with
1 - have needed
1 - dat it
1 - have automatically
1 - automatically done
1 - reorg back
1 - fork there
1 - careful implementation
1 - want since
1 - load all
1 - slow we
1 - number this
1 - doing in
1 - 139 instead
1 - of deleting
1 - added an
1 - extra checkblock
1 - checkblock to
1 - to connectblock
1 - connectblock so
1 - bad blocks
1 - blocks can't
1 - chain once
1 - they're kicked
1 - kicked out
1 - out done
1 - done in
1 - rev 137
1 - 137 i'd
1 - blocks displayed
1 - bar by
1 - 1 when
1 - you first
1 - first load
1 - program it'll
1 - it'll display
1 - display 0
1 - connections 0
1 - blocks 0
1 - 0 transactions
1 - been nbestheight
1 - nbestheight 1
1 - 1 because
1 - it's counting
1 - counting the
1 - block technically
1 - technically yes
1 - hardcoded block
1 - with you
1 - can't have
1 - block maybe
1 - maybe think
1 - reference coin
1 - you measure
1 - measure other
1 - other coins
1 - coins against
1 - count people
1 - for is
1 - blocks they've
1 - they've downloaded
1 - main benefit
1 - benefit is
1 - that blocks
1 - be equal
1 - if blocks
1 - 10 then
1 - highest block
1 - number you
1 - 10 it
1 - block 10
1 - 10 and
1 - block 11
1 - 11 it
1 - would reduce
1 - the confusion
1 - confusion we
1 - had here
1 - difficult approach
1 - approach we
1 - reorg which
1 - will disconnect
1 - the invalid
1 - invalid chain
1 - is code
1 - will rarely
1 - ever get
1 - get tested
1 - is fairly
1 - fairly intricate
1 - intricate so
1 - so something
1 - and safe
1 - safe is
1 - is best
1 - best here's
1 - checks all
1 - bad one
1 - one it
1 - sets all
1 - that chain's
1 - chain's bnchainwork
1 - bnchainwork to
1 - win best
1 - it reduces
1 - reduces best
1 - chain work
1 - fork level
1 - level so
1 - block after
1 - fork will
1 - will cause
1 - change pindexbest
1 - pindexbest without
1 - without actually
1 - actually doing
1 - reorg this
1 - perfect yet
1 - still needs
1 - one valid
1 - valid block
1 - to trigger
1 - trigger the
1 - initiate an
1 - an addtoblockindex
1 - addtoblockindex or
1 - or reorganize
1 - reorganize after
1 - the check
1 - check but
1 - more careful
1 - careful attention
1 - attention i
1 - should break
1 - break out
1 - out part
1 - of addtoblockindex
1 - addtoblockindex that
1 - block i'll
1 - probably end
1 - code below
1 - below i
1 - i wrapped
1 - wrapped sha256
1 - cpp in
1 - in try
1 - we overtook
1 - overtook the
1 - chain somewhere
1 - somewhere around
1 - around 74689
1 - 74689 0
1 - been responding
1 - responding with
1 - number for
1 - some hours
1 - hours now
1 - means it's
1 - dat before
1 - before upgrading
1 - upgrading you
1 - it'll reorg
1 - chain thanks
1 - everyone for

1 - get hey
1 - hey you
1 - be onto
1 - onto something
1 - something hyperthreading
1 - hyperthreading didn't
1 - didn't help
1 - help before
1 - before because
1 - because all
1 - the arithmetic
1 - arithmetic and
1 - and logic
1 - logic units
1 - units which
1 - the hyperthreads
1 - hyperthreads share
1 - share tcatm's
1 - tcatm's sse2
1 - code must
1 - a mix
1 - mix of
1 - of normal
1 - normal x86
1 - x86 instructions
1 - instructions and
1 - and sse2
1 - instructions so
1 - so while
1 - while one
1 - is doing
1 - doing x86
1 - x86 code
1 - other can
1 - do sse2
1 - improvement do
1 - get with
1 - hyperthreading some
1 - some numbers
1 - numbers what
1 - what cpu
1 - cpu is
1 - windows findstr
1 - was on
1 - on block
1 - block 74678
1 - 74678 recently
1 - recently can't
1 - can't wait
1 - wait to
1 - to overtake
1 - overtake it
1 - the stats
1 - stats at
1 - at there's
1 - been 5
1 - 5 blocks
1 - hour in
1 - last 3
1 - hours we
1 - adjustment about
1 - day ago
1 - ago that
1 - have put
1 - also slowed
1 - upgrade we've
1 - already generated
1 - generated 14
1 - 14 blocks
1 - blocks since
1 - since 74638
1 - 74638 the
1 - the builds
1 - 10 were
1 - were uploaded
1 - uploaded about
1 - and 3
1 - ago of
1 - i'm connected
1 - half are
1 - already 0
1 - 10 i
1 - probably already
1 - chain 1
1 - 1 once
1 - once more
1 - node power
1 - is upgraded
1 - upgraded and
1 - will make
1 - any confirmations
1 - confirmations 2
1 - didn't remove
1 - remove your
1 - files you're
1 - not helping
1 - helping to
1 - contribute to
1 - that 50
1 - 50 and
1 - you'll still
1 - show bad
1 - show 74638
1 - 74638 blocks
1 - blocks then
1 - you aren't
1 - aren't connected
1 - any 0
1 - for today
1 - today try
1 - try adding
1 - these parameters
1 - parameters addnode
1 - addnode 75
1 - 75 158
1 - 158 131
1 - 131 108

1 - 68 68
1 - 68 99
1 - 99 14
1 - 14 right
1 - get reincorporated
1 - reincorporated into
1 - fixed chain
1 - transaction won't
1 - won't disappear
1 - disappear it'll
1 - visible on
1 - sides but
1 - the confirmation
1 - confirmation count
1 - count will
1 - will jump
1 - jump back
1 - start counting
1 - counting up
1 - up again
1 - again it's
1 - you generated
1 - after block
1 - 74638 that
1 - the 50
1 - btc from
1 - will disappear
1 - disappear any
1 - any blocks
1 - chain wouldn't
1 - have matured
1 - matured yet
1 - yet for
1 - now can
1 - can some
1 - running 0
1 - 10 with
1 - ip who
1 - connections post
1 - ip then
1 - can addnode
1 - addnode them
1 - one 0
1 - 10 node
1 - suspect there's
1 - some difficulty
1 - difficulty receiving
1 - receiving blocks
1 - to are
1 - are 0
1 - 9 or
1 - lower we
1 - need enough
1 - us so
1 - node you
1 - problem will
1 - will start
1 - away when
1 - 1 8th
1 - 8th of
1 - network it'll
1 - you port
1 - port forward
1 - forward so
1 - 10 patches
1 - patches the
1 - 74638 overflow
1 - bug the
1 - i5 i7
1 - i7 with
1 - hyperthreading and
1 - cpu's try
1 - from sourceforge
1 - sourceforge it
1 - dat the
1 - good block
1 - chain has
1 - has overtaken
1 - overtaken the
1 - it'll automatically
1 - chain agree
1 - agree wanted
1 - time haven't
1 - also subscribe
1 - the bitcoin-list
1 - bitcoin-list mailing
1 - list it
1 - it rarely
1 - rarely gets
1 - used except
1 - for announcements
1 - announcements like
1 - and major
1 - major new
1 - versions starting
1 - at 67000
1 - 67000 is
1 - is yeah
1 - yeah at
1 - moment you'll
1 - you'll stop
1 - stop at
1 - at 74638
1 - 74638 it
1 - start slowly
1 - slowly creeping
1 - creeping up
1 - up as
1 - generate linux
1 - build links
1 - links below
1 - i5 and
1 - cpu's use
1 - links just
1 - just leave
1 - leave the
1 - one alone
1 - alone older
1 - older is
1 - better what
1 - what block
1 - it anywhere
1 - anywhere from
1 - from 60000-74000
1 - 60000-74000 is
1 - had available
1 - while has
1 - been vetted
1 - vetted and
1 - choice don't
1 - don't update
1 - take someone's
1 - someone's block
1 - right up
1 - end a
1 - a somewhat
1 - somewhat old
1 - better so
1 - blocks tcatm's
1 - file sha256
1 - and already
1 - already uploaded
1 - few revs
1 - revs ago
1 - ago i
1 - uploaded rev
1 - 134 which
1 - that enables
1 - enables building
1 - building with
1 - linux if
1 - build rev
1 - 134 on
1 - now you'll
1 - you'll get
1 - switch if
1 - have problems
1 - problems building
1 - building because
1 - then edit
1 - edit makefile
1 - and remove
1 - remove dfourwaysse2
1 - dfourwaysse2 remove
1 - remove obj
1 - o from
1 - these lines
1 - lines bitcoin
1 - bitcoin objs
1 - obj ui
1 - obj uibase
1 - o bitcoind
1 - bitcoind objs
1 - obj obj
1 - obj nogui
1 - nogui obj
1 - o the
1 - 10 linux
1 - build have
1 - 4way option
1 - option when
1 - i build
1 - here are
1 - patch downloads
1 - downloads for
1 - windows steps
1 - and redownload
1 - rest or
1 - mess with
1 - with downloading
1 - downloading blk
1 - this 1
1 - 2 delete
1 - move blk
1 - dat 3
1 - it redownloads
1 - redownloads all
1 - probably take
1 - hour patch
1 - patch is
1 - 132 for
1 - now recommended
1 - recommended steps
1 - files replace
1 - upgrade 4
1 - blocks let
1 - use knightmb's
1 - knightmb's files
1 - just delete
1 - delete your
1 - files but
1 - of load
1 - load on
1 - everyone is
1 - is downloading
1 - whole block
1 - index at
1 - once i'll
1 - i'll build
1 - build releases
1 - releases shortly
1 - shortly once
1 - an update
1 - update you
1 - knightmb's block
1 - chain you'll
1 - you'll want
1 - that's old
1 - old enough
1 - it ends
1 - ends block
1 - 74000 so
1 - recent security
1 - security lockin
1 - lockin will
1 - will check
1 - someone find
1 - link for
1 - people stop
1 - generating we
1 - to re-do
1 - re-do a

1 - the less

1 - changes out
1 - way first
1 - this here's

1 - nobody looks
1 - looks up
1 - up there
1 - there there'll
1 - enough posts
1 - posts to
1 - bump i
1 - so testers
1 - testers can
1 - amd if
1 - checks out

1 - put together
1 - full package
1 - package and

1 - hope someone
1 - someone can

1 - with i'm
1 - it performs
1 - performs much
1 - worse on

1 - pain i
1 - just followed
1 - followed the

1 - a couple
1 - couple little
1 - little corrections
1 - corrections for
1 - 37 which
1 - which i'll
1 - it noted
1 - noted below
1 - below what
1 - you needing
1 - listtransactions for
1 - didn't implement
1 - listtransactions is
1 - sure web
1 - web programmers
1 - programmers don't
1 - to latch
1 - for watching
1 - payments there
1 - no reliable
1 - reliable way
1 - sure nothing
1 - can slip
1 - slip through
1 - the cracks
1 - cracks until
1 - have solid
1 - solid example
1 - code using
1 - using getreceivedbyaddress
1 - and getreceivedbylabel
1 - getreceivedbylabel to
1 - and say
1 - say use
1 - this use
1 - this don't
1 - listtransactions i
1 - should implement
1 - do implement
1 - listtransactions maybe
1 - maybe one
1 - to fight
1 - fight that
1 - all text
1 - text it
1 - not break
1 - break down

1 - something so
1 - thing and
1 - for viewing
1 - viewing the
1 - kinda annoying
1 - annoying for
1 - web interfaces
1 - interfaces that
1 - would rather
1 - rather format
1 - format it
1 - into html
1 - html columns
1 - columns though
1 - it let
1 - send if
1 - not matured
1 - matured your
1 - balance would
1 - been lower
1 - amount it
1 - said balance
1 - 01 right
1 - i try
1 - money or
1 - or insufficient
1 - insufficient funds
1 - funds from
1 - line how
1 - blocks did
1 - it say
1 - had left
1 - mature when
1 - sent there's
1 - still go
1 - through have
1 - copied or
1 - or moved
1 - moved your
1 - dat in
1 - need pre-compiled
1 - pre-compiled header
1 - it compile
1 - compile slightly
1 - slightly faster
1 - i'll just
1 - even still
1 - still you'd
1 - remember to
1 - make f
1 - f makefile
1 - unix clean
1 - clean or
1 - or delete
1 - delete headers
1 - h gch
1 - gch one
1 - the leftover
1 - leftover file
1 - file damn
1 - damn that
1 - that 11
1 - 11 i
1 - thought i'd
1 - i'd been
1 - been careful
1 - accept any
1 - updates yeah
1 - yeah acutely
1 - acutely aware
1 - aware that
1 - have stayed
1 - stayed on
1 - on 9
1 - 9 04
1 - 04 or
1 - or 9
1 - 10 it's
1 - downgrade than
1 - than upgrade
1 - been squeezed
1 - squeezed for
1 - for time
1 - time ubuntu
1 - popular distro
1 - distro so
1 - i'm staying
1 - transaction didn't
1 - didn't go
1 - out immediately
1 - first like
1 - weren't connected
1 - connected at
1 - hours to
1 - to resend
1 - resend it
1 - it long
1 - term it
1 - does keep
1 - keep relentlessly
1 - relentlessly sending
1 - i'll shorten
1 - shorten that
1 - that length
1 - a future
1 - future version
1 - version you
1 - do need
1 - have downloaded
1 - complete block
1 - chain currently
1 - currently 71040
1 - 71040 blocks
1 - before you'll
1 - you'll see
1 - any confirms
1 - confirms same
1 - same with
1 - recipient actually
1 - actually it
1 - just pm
1 - me i'm
1 - i'm the
1 - one who's
1 - who's going
1 - be fixing
1 - fixing it
1 - security flaw
1 - flaw i
1 - definitely like
1 - to hear
1 - hear from
1 - you privately
1 - privately to
1 - goes public
1 - public bitcoin
1 - bitcoin lib64
1 - lib64 libc
1 - libc so
1 - so 6
1 - 6 version
1 - version 11
1 - 11 not
1 - found required
1 - required by
1 - new problem
1 - that started
1 - 6 is
1 - same os
1 - os installations
1 - installations as
1 - 0 unfortunately
1 - i upgraded
1 - to ubuntu
1 - 04 before
1 - not upgrade
1 - upgrade anymore
1 - i might
1 - to reinstall
1 - reinstall to
1 - downgrade but
1 - least by
1 - by not
1 - not upgrading
1 - upgrading it'll
1 - it'll gradually
1 - gradually fix
1 - fix itself
1 - itself 0
1 - 6 linux
1 - is back
1 - old makefile
1 - unix it
1 - it static
1 - links libjpeg
1 - libjpeg so
1 - that working
1 - working better
1 - better if
1 - got 22dbrunrecoveryexception
1 - 22dbrunrecoveryexception and
1 - and you've
1 - used someone
1 - else's build

1 - uploading windows
1 - sourceforge now
1 - now then
1 - then will
1 - will rebuild
1 - rebuild linux
1 - linux haven't
1 - yet wait
1 - 6 i'm
1 - i'm building
1 - can shut
1 - meantime please
1 - asap we
1 - we fixed
1 - fixed an
1 - implementation bug
1 - bug where
1 - that bogus
1 - bogus transactions
1 - transactions could
1 - as accepted
1 - accepted do
1 - not accept
1 - bitcoin transactions
1 - to version
1 - 6 if
1 - can't upgrade
1 - 6 right
1 - away it's
1 - node until
1 - do also

1 - wtf how
1 - did we
1 - that afaik
1 - afaik the
1 - only e-mail
1 - e-mail is
1 - tell the
1 - do notifications
1 - notifications and
1 - guess the
1 - wiki registration
1 - registration i'd
1 - i'd consider
1 - consider turning
1 - turning off
1 - forum notification
1 - notification e-mails
1 - e-mails i
1 - current system
1 - where every
1 - every user
1 - intended configuration

1 - letting users
1 - users just
1 - be users
1 - more burden
1 - burden it
1 - the fewer
1 - fewer nodes
1 - be those
1 - those few
1 - few nodes

1 - i outline
1 - outline how
1 - how a

1 - payments well
1 - enough actually
1 - actually really
1 - well much
1 - lower fraud
1 - fraud rate
1 - rate than
1 - than credit
1 - less if
1 - believe me
1 - convince you
1 - you sorry
1 - sorry you
1 - were looking
1 - wrong code
1 - that applies
1 - applies the
1 - timestamp is
1 - to up
1 - hours in
1 - be earlier
1 - be greater
1 - last 11
1 - 11 blocks
1 - get corrected
1 - corrected in
1 - block had
1 - time too
1 - future like
1 - happened was
1 - broke in
1 - the osx
1 - build does
1 - actually work
1 - work after
1 - after just
1 - for makefile
1 - makefile vc
1 - vc also
1 - it compiled
1 - compiled but
1 - but sha-256
1 - sha-256 didn't
1 - work correctly
1 - correctly it
1 - it returned
1 - returned the
1 - same incorrect
1 - incorrect hash
1 - we'll disable
1 - anyone figures
1 - figures out
1 - can re-enable
1 - 1 7x
1 - 7x faster
1 - faster from
1 - the midstate
1 - midstate optimisation
1 - optimisation the
1 - sha-256 works
1 - works with
1 - linux and
1 - and windows
1 - windows mingw
1 - mingw i
1 - this makefile
1 - osx change
1 - svn let
1 - that compiles
1 - compiles now
1 - database doesn't
1 - doesn't like
1 - the relative
1 - path bitcoind
1 - subdir getinfo
1 - getinfo works
1 - works against
1 - a running
1 - running daemon
1 - daemon but
1 - but trying
1 - start the
1 - the daemon
1 - daemon as
1 - as bitcoind
1 - subdir gets
1 - gets that
1 - that exception
1 - exception i
1 - should resolve
1 - full path
1 - path before
1 - before passing
1 - passing it
1 - ever use
1 - use datadir
1 - a relative

1 - thanks i'd
1 - i'd also
1 - also like
1 - don't turn

1 - generate you'd
1 - think as

1 - it worked
1 - worked the

1 - about 48
1 - 48 faster
1 - combined speedup

1 - you figure
1 - what wrong
1 - wrong i
1 - hope it's
1 - put up

1 - a fight

1 - correct me
1 - me if
1 - wrong please
1 - i'll gladly
1 - gladly eat
1 - eat crow
1 - crow but
1 - attack on
1 - on ripemd-160
1 - ripemd-160 in
1 - case an
1 - attack prescribes
1 - prescribes a
1 - certain range
1 - range or
1 - or pattern
1 - pattern of

1 - inputs to
1 - will greatly

1 - increase your
1 - your chance
1 - collision here
1 - here you
1 - that kind
1 - over ripemd-160's
1 - ripemd-160's input
1 - input because
1 - input is
1 - of sha-256
1 - attack helps
1 - find an
1 - input to
1 - to ripemd-160
1 - ripemd-160 that
1 - that produces
1 - produces a
1 - collision what
1 - get sha-256
1 - sha-256 to
1 - to output
1 - that value
1 - value so
1 - break sha-256
1 - sha-256 too
1 - too for
1 - for brute
1 - force ripemd-160
1 - sha-256 x
1 - x is
1 - no stronger
1 - stronger than
1 - than ripemd-160
1 - ripemd-160 alone
1 - alone but
1 - for analytical
1 - must analytical
1 - attack both
1 - both ripemd-160
1 - wrong then
1 - strength is
1 - as ripemd-160
1 - sha-256 only
1 - one round
1 - round of
1 - of key
1 - key strengthening
1 - strengthening you
1 - with public
1 - key 654321
1 - 654321 you
1 - collision using
1 - for which
1 - key when
1 - you claim
1 - claim a
1 - address transaction
1 - give your
1 - your public
1 - hash then
1 - must sign
1 - key red's
1 - red's point
1 - to quickly
1 - quickly generate
1 - generate insecure
1 - insecure public
1 - keys which
1 - could break
1 - break and
1 - key after
1 - collision he
1 - he points
1 - points out
1 - was required
1 - a secure
1 - secure one
1 - one one
1 - which must
1 - have required
1 - required significant
1 - significant work
1 - the prime
1 - numbers that
1 - strength above
1 - that of
1 - function alone
1 - alone someone
1 - someone trying
1 - to brute
1 - force would
1 - take time
1 - time generating
1 - attempt red
1 - red thanks
1 - for telling
1 - telling me
1 - privately first
1 - first please
1 - please go
1 - and post
1 - and relieve
1 - relieve the
1 - the suspense
1 - suspense for
1 - everyone his
1 - his point
1 - that transactions
1 - transactions paid
1 - as secure
1 - function to
1 - addresses short
1 - short they
1 - key not
1 - key itself
1 - itself an
1 - not ecdsa
1 - privately so
1 - fixed first
1 - just e-mailed
1 - e-mailed you
1 - you my
1 - could pm
1 - me here
1 - here please
1 - 3 important
1 - improvements were
1 - were made
1 - made in
1 - 3 new
1 - minutes please
1 - please do
1 - do these
1 - these tests
1 - network that's
1 - it's for
1 - for thanks
1 - thanks was
1 - network flatdata
1 - flatdata was
1 - workaround to
1 - serialize a
1 - fixed field
1 - field length
1 - length array
1 - array there
1 - a cleaner
1 - cleaner way
1 - it understand
1 - serialize arrays
1 - arrays directly
1 - directly but
1 - but msvc6
1 - msvc6 couldn't
1 - keep compatibility
1 - compatibility with
1 - with msvc6
1 - msvc6 at
1 - support msvc6
1 - msvc6 anymore
1 - anymore because
1 - use something
1 - boost that
1 - we lost
1 - lost support
1 - 0 maybe
1 - someday i'll
1 - i'll swap
1 - the clean
1 - clean way
1 - just knows
1 - serialize fixed
1 - fixed length
1 - length arrays
1 - arrays without
1 - without wrapping
1 - wrapping them
1 - in flatdata
1 - flatdata please
1 - test 0
1 - 5 in
1 - in preparation
1 - preparation for
1 - release this
1 - looking good
1 - i encourage
1 - encourage you
1 - and upgrade
1 - windows or
1 - or linux
1 - linux new
1 - problem can
1 - can anyone
1 - anyone confirm
1 - if json-rpc
1 - json-rpc over
1 - over http
1 - http is
1 - use status
1 - 500 if
1 - reply is
1 - reply i
1 - i picked
1 - picked that
1 - up maybe
1 - like 200
1 - 200 would
1 - sense unless
1 - the mechanics
1 - mechanics of
1 - http request
1 - request itself
1 - said and
1 - forgot and
1 - and spread
1 - spread 500
1 - 500 to
1 - all error
1 - responses obviously
1 - obviously it's
1 - it repeats
1 - repeats the
1 - follow the
1 - 0 spec
1 - it called
1 - called for
1 - for multiple
1 - they mean
1 - sure i
1 - saw that
1 - back http
1 - reply if
1 - contains multiple
1 - multiple responses
1 - responses and
1 - error i
1 - guess so
1 - always return
1 - return 200
1 - 200 i
1 - think someone
1 - someone sounded
1 - sounded like
1 - the 500
1 - 500 might
1 - be causing
1 - causing a
1 - probably gets
1 - gets fixed
1 - fixed after
1 - 3 until
1 - use single
1 - single invocation
1 - any json-rpc
1 - json-rpc package
1 - package even
1 - even supports
1 - supports multiple
1 - invocation probably
1 - not it
1 - could pin
1 - pin down
1 - down better
1 - better how
1 - how multiple-invocation
1 - multiple-invocation is
1 - all before
1 - before trying
1 - and whether
1 - whether returning
1 - returning http
1 - for error
1 - error response
1 - is right
1 - think authentication
1 - be disabled
1 - no conf
1 - file doesn't
1 - contain rpcpassword
1 - rpcpassword but
1 - but what
1 - contains rpcpassword
1 - rpcpassword i
1 - see both
1 - both points
1 - points what
1 - the programmer
1 - programmer can't
1 - can't figure
1 - do http
1 - authentication in
1 - their language
1 - language fortran
1 - fortran or
1 - whatever or
1 - even supported
1 - supported by
1 - by their
1 - their json-rpc
1 - library should
1 - should they
1 - they be
1 - to explicitly
1 - explicitly disable
1 - password requirement
1 - requirement otoh
1 - otoh what
1 - template conf
1 - with rpcpassword
1 - rpcpassword fill
1 - password here
1 - many systems
1 - to log
1 - in without
1 - forum for
1 - instance gavin's
1 - gavin's point
1 - point seems
1 - seems stronger
1 - stronger btw
1 - hope having
1 - having rpcpassword
1 - rpcpassword in
1 - the conf
1 - valid it's
1 - use server
1 - password it
1 - fine is
1 - right not
1 - really i'll
1 - to 1000
1 - 1000 next
1 - some adjustments
1 - adjustments to
1 - database settings
1 - settings i
1 - download about
1 - 5 times
1 - faster it
1 - downloads in
1 - about 30
1 - database default
1 - default had
1 - it writing
1 - writing each
1 - disk synchronously
1 - synchronously which
1 - settings to
1 - it cache
1 - cache the
1 - write them
1 - a batch
1 - batch blocks
1 - written transactionally
1 - transactionally so
1 - so either
1 - complete change
1 - change occurs
1 - occurs or
1 - or none
1 - either case
1 - is left
1 - left in
1 - valid state
1 - state i
1 - enabled this
1 - change during
1 - you come
1 - come within
1 - within 2000
1 - 2000 blocks
1 - block these
1 - these changes
1 - changes turn
1 - off and
1 - it slows
1 - old way
1 - built a
1 - it these
1 - these binaries
1 - binaries also
1 - also include
1 - include gavin
1 - andresen's json-rpc
1 - other important
1 - improvements from
1 - 2 i've
1 - test over
1 - hours that
1 - that kills
1 - kills and

1 - rpc stuff
1 - can print
1 - print to

1 - into all
1 - the esoteric
1 - esoteric c
1 - c syntax
1 - syntax like
1 - like typed
1 - typed value
1 - value extraction
1 - extraction we
1 - more features
1 - features if
1 - want later
1 - later lets
1 - with http

1 - parameter thanks
1 - that survey
1 - survey i
1 - i find
1 - find key

1 - little unnatural
1 - unnatural there
1 - there ought
1 - more definite
1 - definite separator
1 - separator between

1 - that suggests
1 - suggests assignment

1 - language's split
1 - split function
1 - function key

1 - than this
1 - this allright
1 - allright then
1 - then lets
1 - with self-parsed
1 - self-parsed mapconfig
1 - mapconfig syntax
1 - syntax file
1 - extension conf
1 - conf what's
1 - filename is
1 - bitcoin settings
1 - settings conf
1 - or bitcoin
1 - bitcoin conf
1 - we better
1 - better strip
1 - strip whitespace
1 - whitespace at
1 - and end
1 - value user
1 - who likes
1 - likes column
1 - column formatted
1 - formatted this
1 - this guess
1 - too the
1 - normal syntax
1 - syntax should
1 - be key
1 - can't blame
1 - blame people
1 - people for
1 - occasional key
1 - was researching
1 - researching config
1 - file formats

1 - the comma
1 - comma at

1 - lines i
1 - suppose we
1 - easily preprocess
1 - preprocess json
1 - json reading
1 - reading the

1 - line at
1 - time truncate
1 - truncate the

1 - any character
1 - character and
1 - or concatenate
1 - concatenate them
1 - string and
1 - pass it
1 - to json
1 - json so
1 - go boost
1 - has boost
1 - boost we
1 - could read
1 - read lines

1 - yaml someday
1 - someday if
1 - more complexity
1 - complexity if
1 - with self
1 - parsed that
1 - mean we

1 - json on
1 - on particular
1 - particular parameter
1 - values as

1 - more structured
1 - structured data
1 - data it
1 - always parse
1 - parse its

1 - json although
1 - all on

1 - think what

1 - particular problem
1 - think your

1 - laggy because
1 - because you're

1 - pagefile because
1 - because memory
1 - full you
1 - you confirmed
1 - confirmed when

1 - shut off
1 - off generation
1 - generation that

1 - drops to
1 - definitely all
1 - all idle
1 - priority there's
1 - 1 that
1 - would affect
1 - affect these
1 - things well
1 - well it
1 - can't hurt
1 - backup and

1 - sourceforge mac
1 - x didn't
1 - didn't need
1 - any fixes
1 - fixes so
1 - still good
1 - org then
1 - then all
1 - thread which
1 - which definitely
1 - definitely runs
1 - runs at
1 - lowest possible
1 - possible priority
1 - priority idle
1 - 100 since
1 - it's idle
1 - priority it
1 - won't actually
1 - actually slow
1 - slow anything
1 - else down
1 - down even
1 - 100 we
1 - even specify
1 - specify linking
1 - linking 4
1 - 4 11
1 - 11 so
1 - so gcc
1 - gcc must
1 - must automatically
1 - automatically link
1 - it behind
1 - scenes there's
1 - there's probably
1 - a compiler
1 - compiler switch
1 - the licensing
1 - licensing issues
1 - issues would
1 - be typically
1 - typically compiler
1 - compiler stuff
1 - is fully
1 - fully redistributable
1 - redistributable more
1 - more directly
1 - directly this
1 - be posting
1 - posting release
1 - candidate of
1 - fix shortly
1 - shortly please
1 - it fixes
1 - fixes the

1 - being blocked
1 - blocked you
1 - exe an

1 - in live
1 - protection this
1 - is becoming
1 - becoming a
1 - common problem
1 - should write
1 - write this
1 - a pegged
1 - pegged thread
1 - message warning

1 - to higher
1 - priority for
1 - for less
1 - second every
1 - this soon
1 - soon there
1 - few other
1 - other issues
1 - issues we
1 - at fixing
1 - fixing in
1 - 1 before
1 - before making
1 - making a
1 - release that's
1 - that's interesting
1 - interesting i
1 - very clunky
1 - clunky but
1 - cpu peg
1 - peg problem
1 - problem too
1 - too anyone
1 - else able
1 - problem we
1 - had this
1 - this feature
1 - feature disabled
1 - disabled on
1 - linux before
1 - it seemed
1 - seemed better
1 - the imperfect
1 - imperfect ui
1 - ui than
1 - feature entirely
1 - entirely i'm
1 - thinking we
1 - should disable
1 - again on
1 - linux what
1 - what language
1 - language is
1 - computer set
1 - to is
1 - it set
1 - to german
1 - dutch or
1 - or italian
1 - italian is
1 - it one
1 - those sub-languages
1 - sub-languages like
1 - like nl
1 - nl it's
1 - a translation
1 - translation and
1 - and failing
1 - failing you
1 - could delete
1 - the locale
1 - locale directory
1 - bitcoin so
1 - test each
1 - each language
1 - language on
1 - ubuntu and
1 - maybe all
1 - all three
1 - three this
1 - second time
1 - this live
1 - protection problem
1 - problem reported
1 - reported it
1 - be blocking
1 - blocking the
1 - the program's
1 - program's network
1 - it's allowing
1 - allowing connections
1 - made hence
1 - hence the
1 - 10 connections
1 - connections shown
1 - shown but
1 - them we
1 - understand this
1 - problem better
1 - someone write
1 - some instructions
1 - instructions on
1 - wiki explaining
1 - off or
1 - an exclusion
1 - exclusion to
1 - to live
1 - protection or
1 - whatever its
1 - its full
1 - full proper
1 - proper name
1 - is laszlo
1 - laszlo corrected
1 - corrected this
1 - but unfortunately
1 - unfortunately it
1 - soon though
1 - have used
1 - os isn't
1 - isn't supposed
1 - increase priority
1 - the ought
1 - to leave
1 - at priority
1 - priority 0
1 - 8 it
1 - needs wxwidgets
1 - 9 unfortunately
1 - 9 yet
1 - yet thanks
1 - that calculator
1 - calculator the
1 - difficulty doubled
1 - doubled a
1 - ago plus
1 - plus it's
1 - random and
1 - have surprisingly
1 - surprisingly long
1 - long dry
1 - dry spells
1 - spells in
1 - in windows
1 - windows you
1 - you select
1 - select the
1 - manager right
1 - right click
1 - click set
1 - set priority
1 - priority set
1 - set it
1 - to belownormal
1 - belownormal or
1 - or low
1 - low that
1 - shouldn't make
1 - difference though
1 - though if
1 - you turn
1 - off generate
1 - coins does
1 - usage go
1 - go flat
1 - flat that
1 - would confirm
1 - taking is
1 - is generate
1 - generate which
1 - is idle
1 - priority already
1 - already it
1 - be it's
1 - it's slow
1 - slow just
1 - have too
1 - things running
1 - running at
1 - you're out
1 - memory when
1 - you switch
1 - switch from
1 - another it
1 - to page
1 - page it
1 - disk so
1 - was responsible
1 - responsible for
1 - keeping blocks
1 - from downloading
1 - link win32
1 - win32 cpu
1 - cpu cycles
1 - cycles vs
1 - vs live
1 - protection engines
1 - engines for
1 - for bitcoinfx
1 - bitcoinfx live
1 - protection was
1 - was keeping
1 - keeping it
1 - from getting
1 - cpu for
1 - coins you
1 - said your
1 - your friend
1 - friend was
1 - getting 1400-1600
1 - 1400-1600 khash
1 - s so
1 - cpu i
1 - guess live
1 - protection must
1 - been blocking
1 - blocking some
1 - other part
1 - program then
1 - then true
1 - it happened
1 - happened suddenly
1 - suddenly if
1 - it happens
1 - happens gradually
1 - still transition
1 - something stronger
1 - stronger when
1 - the upgraded
1 - upgraded software
1 - would re-sign
1 - re-sign all
1 - new stronger
1 - stronger signature
1 - algorithm by
1 - by creating
1 - transaction sending
1 - yourself with
1 - the stronger
1 - stronger sig
1 - sig i'll
1 - start thinking
1 - can kind
1 - connect you
1 - to local

1 - which included
1 - included changes
1 - and setup
1 - setup nsi
1 - nsi i
1 - maximum number

1 - than needed
1 - needed 8
1 - plenty for

1 - removed 0
1 - 3 is

1 - released so
1 - so go
1 - but generating

1 - the feedback

1 - so 0
1 - 3 hashes
1 - hashes 20
1 - 0 but
1 - assume he
1 - he used
1 - used that

1 - build 30khash
1 - 30khash increase
1 - increase to
1 - what total
1 - total rate
1 - rate to
1 - figure the

1 - increase you
1 - figured it

1 - reply it
1 - like laszlo's

1 - database is

1 - it much
1 - was designing

1 - far all

1 - 1 was
1 - core design
1 - design was
1 - was set
1 - in stone
1 - stone for
1 - its lifetime
1 - lifetime because
1 - support every

1 - could think
1 - was each
1 - each thing
1 - thing required
1 - required special
1 - special support
1 - support code
1 - and data
1 - fields whether

1 - used or
1 - only covered
1 - covered one
1 - case at
1 - been an
1 - an explosion
1 - explosion of
1 - of special
1 - special cases
1 - cases the
1 - was script
1 - script which
1 - which generalizes
1 - generalizes the
1 - problem so
1 - so transacting
1 - transacting parties
1 - parties can
1 - can describe
1 - describe their
1 - predicate that
1 - network evaluates
1 - evaluates the
1 - the extent
1 - extent of
1 - of evaluating
1 - evaluating whether
1 - sender's conditions
1 - conditions are
1 - are met
1 - met the
1 - script is
1 - actually a
1 - predicate it's
1 - just an
1 - an equation
1 - equation that
1 - that evaluates
1 - evaluates to
1 - to true
1 - true or
1 - or false
1 - false predicate
1 - predicate is
1 - and unfamiliar
1 - unfamiliar word
1 - word so
1 - i called
1 - called it
1 - it script
1 - receiver of

1 - template match
1 - match on
1 - script currently
1 - currently receivers
1 - receivers only
1 - accept two
1 - two templates
1 - templates direct
1 - direct payment
1 - address future
1 - versions can
1 - add templates
1 - templates for
1 - more transaction
1 - types and
1 - nodes running
1 - that version
1 - higher will
1 - verify and
1 - blocks even
1 - though they
1 - read them
1 - supports a
1 - tremendous variety
1 - types that
1 - designed years
1 - ago escrow
1 - transactions bonded
1 - bonded contracts
1 - contracts third
1 - party arbitration
1 - arbitration multi-party
1 - multi-party signature
1 - signature etc
1 - etc if
1 - on in
1 - big way
1 - are things
1 - things we'll
1 - we'll want
1 - to explore
1 - explore in
1 - designed at
1 - second compatible
1 - compatible implementation
1 - idea so
1 - design depends
1 - getting exactly
1 - exactly identical
1 - identical results
1 - in lockstep
1 - lockstep that
1 - second implementation
1 - implementation would
1 - a menace
1 - menace to

1 - download taking
1 - taking for
1 - you yeah
1 - yeah that
1 - that actually
1 - actually is
1 - is getallreceived
1 - getallreceived 0
1 - 0 should
1 - want now
1 - it's renamed
1 - to listreceivedbyaddress
1 - listreceivedbyaddress 0
1 - default is
1 - confirmation but
1 - in reality
1 - reality most
1 - most digital
1 - services can
1 - say if
1 - confirmations you
1 - show two
1 - two numbers
1 - numbers unconfirmed
1 - and available
1 - balance so
1 - they immediately
1 - see their
1 - transaction went
1 - through listreceivedbyaddress
1 - listreceivedbyaddress minconf
1 - minconf 1
1 - 1 includeempty
1 - includeempty false
1 - false minconf
1 - minconf is
1 - minimum number
1 - confirmations before
1 - before payments
1 - included includeempty
1 - includeempty whether
1 - include addresses
1 - payments returns
1 - returns an
1 - an array
1 - array of
1 - of objects
1 - objects containing
1 - containing address
1 - address receiving
1 - address label
1 - label the
1 - label of
1 - amount total
1 - total amount
1 - address confirmations
1 - confirmations number
1 - confirmations of
1 - recent transaction
1 - transaction included
1 - included or
1 - or listreceivedbylabel
1 - listreceivedbylabel if
1 - you're labelling
1 - labelling addresses
1 - their username
1 - username so
1 - i've concentrated
1 - on functions
1 - web merchants
1 - merchants not
1 - much on
1 - on stuff
1 - stuff for
1 - for remote
1 - remote management
1 - management of
1 - of headless
1 - headless coin
1 - coin generators
1 - generators yet
1 - yet this
1 - will soon
1 - soon make
1 - address window
1 - window automatically
1 - automatically change
1 - change whenever
1 - address displayed
1 - displayed i'm
1 - also recommending
1 - recommending this
1 - this approach
1 - apps i
1 - just posted
1 - showing a
1 - a suggested
1 - suggested way
1 - implementing this
1 - this versions
1 - versions on
1 - svn since
1 - 2 4
1 - 4 already
1 - address bar
1 - encourage changing
1 - manually too
1 - too theymos
1 - theymos if
1 - else we
1 - can fall
1 - back on
1 - that solution
1 - solution in
1 - future i
1 - added label
1 - label related
1 - related functions
1 - with managing
1 - managing multiple
1 - addresses per
1 - per user
1 - user new
1 - new or
1 - or renamed
1 - renamed functions
1 - are amount
1 - single address
1 - this label
1 - label list
1 - list addresses
1 - received list
1 - list labels
1 - labels and
1 - received misc
1 - misc label
1 - for completeness
1 - completeness for
1 - renamed getamountreceived
1 - getamountreceived getreceivedbyaddress
1 - and getallreceived
1 - getallreceived listreceivedbyaddress
1 - listreceivedbyaddress the
1 - old names
1 - break existing
1 - they're deprecated
1 - deprecated the
1 - idea is
1 - username whenever
1 - you call
1 - call getnewaddress
1 - user's total
1 - total received
1 - received across
1 - across all
1 - their addresses
1 - addresses using
1 - the bylabel
1 - bylabel functions
1 - freely change
1 - their address
1 - about tracking
1 - tracking all
1 - their old
1 - old addresses
1 - addresses a
1 - good way
1 - to automate
1 - automate changing
1 - user's receiving
1 - just before
1 - before displaying
1 - displaying their
1 - their current
1 - current address
1 - address check
1 - then replace
1 - one get
1 - has received
1 - you're just
1 - just getting
1 - getting one
1 - one particular
1 - particular user's
1 - user's balance
1 - balance such
1 - page request
1 - request by
1 - user use
1 - getreceivedbylabel but
1 - you're scanning
1 - scanning over
1 - over all
1 - use listreceivedbylabel
1 - listreceivedbylabel to
1 - scan against
1 - result scanning
1 - scanning users
1 - users with
1 - with getreceivedbylabel
1 - getreceivedbylabel would
1 - be n-squared
1 - n-squared using
1 - using listreceivedbylabel
1 - listreceivedbylabel is
1 - is n-log-n
1 - n-log-n or
1 - or n
1 - n linear
1 - linear you
1 - only really
1 - to scan
1 - scan all
1 - you're polling
1 - polling in
1 - to spontaneously
1 - spontaneously take
1 - take action
1 - action in
1 - to money
1 - money received
1 - received rather
1 - user going
1 - a webpage
1 - webpage seeing
1 - seeing their
1 - their balance
1 - and telling
1 - telling you
1 - poll very
1 - very frequently
1 - frequently if
1 - you require
1 - require 1
1 - confirmation that'll
1 - that'll take
1 - minutes anyway
1 - in polling
1 - polling more
1 - than every
1 - services where
1 - don't lose
1 - lose much
1 - much if
1 - free access
1 - resold for
1 - for profit
1 - profit i
1 - think you're
1 - were selling
1 - selling gold
1 - gold or
1 - or currency
1 - need multiple
1 - multiple confirmations
1 - confirmations almost
1 - almost but
1 - quite bitcoin
1 - do digital
1 - signing not
1 - not encryption
1 - encryption rsa
1 - both but
1 - bigger and
1 - been impractical
1 - impractical it's
1 - download so
1 - as verifying
1 - verifying all
1 - signatures in
1 - downloads that
1 - time how
1 - typically taking
1 - taking does
1 - it slow
1 - down half
1 - way through
1 - through or
1 - speed the
1 - whole way
1 - way i've
1 - about ways
1 - more cursory
1 - cursory check
1 - few thousand
1 - thousand blocks
1 - things to
1 - on simplified
1 - for lightweight
1 - lightweight client-only
1 - client-only users
1 - who only
1 - generate and
1 - don't participate
1 - participate in
1 - network they
1 - blocks just
1 - hash chain
1 - currently about
1 - about 2mb
1 - 2mb and
1 - and very
1 - very quick
1 - quick to
1 - verify less
1 - second to
1 - whole chain
1 - network becomes
1 - becomes very
1 - large like
1 - like over
1 - over 100
1 - 000 nodes
1 - nodes this
1 - what we'll
1 - we'll use
1 - allow common
1 - common users
1 - blown nodes
1 - nodes at
1 - stage most
1 - running client-only
1 - client-only software
1 - the specialist
1 - specialist server
1 - farms keep
1 - running full
1 - nodes kind
1 - like how
1 - the usenet
1 - usenet network
1 - has consolidated
1 - consolidated spv
1 - spv is
1 - implemented until
1 - until far
1 - but all
1 - current implementation
1 - designed around

1 - and learning
1 - learning to
1 - use software
1 - more familiar
1 - familiar way
1 - only disadvantage
1 - disadvantage is
1 - site but
1 - that's fine
1 - for pocket
1 - change amounts
1 - micropayments and
1 - and misc
1 - misc expenses
1 - expenses it's
1 - started and
1 - get larger
1 - larger amounts
1 - amounts then
1 - actual bitcoin
1 - software a
1 - little late
1 - late but
1 - case anyone
1 - same issue
1 - issue the
1 - compile dump
1 - dump had
1 - had 2
1 - 2 warnings
1 - warnings that

1 - 20 lines
1 - lines long
1 - 2 link
1 - link errors
1 - errors the
1 - errors were
1 - were those
1 - probably due
1 - to switching
1 - switching to
1 - wxwidgets instead
1 - debug they're
1 - they're moving
1 - towards only
1 - only debug
1 - and ditching
1 - ditching the
1 - probably don't
1 - their release
1 - by referring
1 - referring to

1 - and generica
1 - generica for
1 - for detailing
1 - detailing the
1 - freebsd at

1 - is 8333
1 - tell other
1 - other bitcoin
1 - bitcoin nodes
1 - to router
1 - router 8333
1 - 8333 even
1 - you're redirecting
1 - redirecting from
1 - any benefit
1 - benefit to
1 - connection port
1 - you're providing
1 - providing one
1 - port then
1 - then you've

1 - two incoming
1 - incoming ports
1 - same person
1 - person doesn't
1 - doesn't help
1 - help redundancy
1 - many computers
1 - computers then
1 - then using
1 - connect locally
1 - locally makes
1 - makes more
1 - sense sheriffwoody
1 - sheriffwoody bitcoin
1 - generate are
1 - are kept
1 - kept forever
1 - forever a

1 - kept to
1 - show ownership
1 - ownership of

1 - addresses should
1 - any problem
1 - problem at
1 - all if
1 - generated 50000
1 - 50000 btc
1 - btc then
1 - have 1000
1 - 1000 own
1 - addresses one
1 - each 50
1 - 50 generated
1 - generated those
1 - are hidden
1 - hidden they're
1 - not shown
1 - shown in
1 - ui it
1 - little code
1 - that keeps
1 - keeps giving
1 - ip here's
1 - did in
1 - c to
1 - key aka
1 - aka bitcoin
1 - it keep
1 - it sends
1 - key mapreusekey
1 - mapreusekey pfrom
1 - pfrom addr
1 - addr ip
1 - ip later
1 - not convenient
1 - received just
1 - just clear
1 - clear the
1 - cached keys
1 - keys every
1 - every 20
1 - parameter to
1 - to getnewaddress
1 - getnewaddress for
1 - for number

1 - that fail
1 - a call
1 - to openssl
1 - openssl that
1 - i assumed
1 - assumed would
1 - never fail
1 - fail but
1 - error check
1 - check there
1 - fail out
1 - memory maybe
1 - maybe is
1 - constant there
1 - there you
1 - go we
1 - easily do
1 - way like
1 - like bitcoinaddress
1 - amount amount
1 - amount bitcoin
1 - can answer
1 - answer port
1 - port 8330
1 - 8330 on
1 - on local
1 - loopback just
1 - on 8332
1 - 8332 it
1 - http answer
1 - answer i
1 - that although
1 - take care
1 - care of
1 - of business
1 - response by
1 - by presenting
1 - presenting html
1 - html ui
1 - ui to
1 - user as
1 - user i
1 - would wonder
1 - some website
1 - to trick
1 - trick me
1 - really talking
1 - talking to
1 - response could
1 - could simply
1 - simply be
1 - be html
1 - html with
1 - the javascript
1 - javascript equivalent
1 - equivalent of
1 - back button
1 - button sending
1 - page bitcoin
1 - bitcoin then
1 - then pops
1 - bitcoins dialog
1 - dialog with
1 - the destination
1 - destination bitcoin
1 - amount already
1 - already filled
1 - work just
1 - mailto link
1 - that pops
1 - new email
1 - email with
1 - address filled
1 - in 127
1 - 1 loopback
1 - loopback is
1 - is accessible
1 - accessible by
1 - any user
1 - user on
1 - machine it
1 - have per-user
1 - per-user separation
1 - separation but
1 - ok because

1 - space on
1 - own computer
1 - computer like
1 - like 500
1 - bytes it's
1 - like generating
1 - new pgp
1 - pgp private
1 - key but
1 - less cpu
1 - cpu intensive
1 - intensive because
1 - ecc the
1 - is effectively
1 - effectively unlimited
1 - unlimited it
1 - doesn't hurt
1 - hurt anyone

1 - users treated

1 - freeloaders it
1 - can't really
1 - be advertising

1 - provide wxwidgets

1 - it's unfortunate

1 - wxwidgets are
1 - are available

1 - packages eventually
1 - eventually they'll
1 - they'll provide
1 - a 2
1 - 9 package
1 - do svg
1 - svg but
1 - original very
1 - large over
1 - over 500
1 - 500 pixels
1 - pixels across
1 - across so
1 - scaled down
1 - down i'll
1 - original when
1 - finished i
1 - custom tweak
1 - tweak each

1 - icon size
1 - the vertical
1 - vertical lines
1 - lines land
1 - their pixels
1 - pixels otherwise
1 - otherwise they're
1 - they're ugly
1 - ugly blurry
1 - blurry and
1 - and inconsistent
1 - inconsistent such
1 - such is
1 - challenge of
1 - making icons
1 - original will
1 - good for
1 - scaling to
1 - sizes between
1 - between 48
1 - and 500
1 - 500 but
1 - not smaller
1 - smaller are
1 - don't recommend
1 - recommend using
1 - using anything
1 - anything other
1 - reference in
1 - the wx
1 - wx headers
1 - headers arrstr
1 - something outside
1 - outside of
1 - of wxbase
1 - wxbase removing
1 - removing from
1 - from bitcoin's
1 - bitcoin's makefile
1 - makefile would
1 - probably solve
1 - working you
1 - edit wxwidgets
1 - wxwidgets include
1 - include wx
1 - wx arrstr

1 - suspect bitcoind
1 - bitcoind will
1 - probably work
1 - fine but
1 - still debug
1 - problem yes
1 - original is
1 - is 546x531
1 - 546x531 pixels

1 - true with
1 - the send-to-ip
1 - send-to-ip option
1 - option you
1 - are sending
1 - ip sending
1 - implement an
1 - ip bitcoin
1 - address option
1 - both it
1 - would sign
1 - the one-time-use
1 - one-time-use address
1 - prove it
1 - it belongs
1 - belongs to
1 - intended receiver
1 - receiver for
1 - of anonymity
1 - anonymity you
1 - 2 which
1 - few weeks
1 - weeks away
1 - away i'll
1 - post tor
1 - 5 backup
1 - directory version
1 - can backup
1 - backup just
1 - dat nope
1 - nope the
1 - whole design
1 - design is
1 - about preventing
1 - preventing that
1 - from working
1 - working those
1 - coins can
1 - recovered and
1 - less since
1 - the effective
1 - effective circulation
1 - is reduced
1 - reduced all
1 - remaining coins
1 - are worth
1 - the opposite
1 - opposite of
1 - of when
1 - a government
1 - government prints
1 - prints money
1 - of existing
1 - existing money
1 - money goes
1 - down it's
1 - currently 29
1 - 29 296
1 - 296 blocks
1 - the circulation
1 - blocks times
1 - times 50
1 - 50 so
1 - current circulation
1 - 1 464
1 - 464 800
1 - 800 bc
1 - bc if
1 - have 24k
1 - 24k blocks
1 - have finished
1 - finished the
1 - download exit
1 - again version
1 - better faster
1 - faster at
1 - typically a
1 - few hundred
1 - hundred right
1 - easy now
1 - now but
1 - but it'll
1 - get harder
1 - harder as
1 - grows good
1 - good question
1 - it's tcp
1 - tcp the
1 - website needs
1 - updated to
1 - say tcp
1 - tcp port
1 - so other
1 - you so
1 - you stay
1 - connected because
1 - are able
1 - also need
1 - receive payments
1 - address no
1 - nodes won't
1 - won't accept
1 - accept that
1 - that being
1 - being open
1 - source means
1 - means anyone
1 - can independently
1 - independently review
1 - review the
1 - was closed
1 - source nobody
1 - security i
1 - it's essential
1 - program of
1 - this nature
1 - nature to
1 - source slower
1 - machines produce
1 - produce fewer
1 - fewer coins
1 - it's proportional
1 - to cpu
1 - cpu speed
1 - speed there
1 - more coming
1 - coming it
1 - database called
1 - called berkeley
1 - db it
1 - not lose
1 - lose data
1 - system crash
1 - crash transactions
1 - are written
1 - database immediately
1 - immediately when
1 - they're received
1 - received for
1 - just multiply
1 - total blocks
1 - by 50
1 - 50 the
1 - almost a
1 - year now
1 - and coding
1 - coding started
1 - in 2007
1 - 2007 that's
1 - good approach
1 - mobile programmatic
1 - programmatic api
1 - api used
1 - by php
1 - php any
1 - to present
1 - present a
1 - web ui
1 - ui covers
1 - covers remote
1 - admin mobile
1 - mobile and
1 - other client
1 - online all
1 - ip it
1 - like webmail
1 - webmail it
1 - started if
1 - website not
1 - not install
1 - install software
1 - software yeah
1 - yeah we
1 - phase out
1 - out irc
1 - to preprogram
1 - list once
1 - seeded you
1 - irc there
1 - issues in
1 - 5 where
1 - download could
1 - get bogged
1 - bogged down
1 - down 0
1 - goes smoothly
1 - smoothly it
1 - take less
1 - hour i
1 - get 0
1 - 2 out
1 - door the
1 - blocks increase
1 - increase linearly
1 - linearly it'll
1 - be decades
1 - decades before
1 - it's millions
1 - millions in
1 - in theory
1 - theory the
1 - time should
1 - should top
1 - top out
1 - out 8
1 - 8 months
1 - months from
1 - when moore's
1 - law will
1 - be growing
1 - growing faster
1 - chain it's
1 - it's svn
1 - sourceforge pm
1 - sourceforge account
1 - access that's
1 - great because
1 - because that's
1 - less expertise
1 - expertise for
1 - instance i
1 - haven't researched
1 - researched the
1 - option adds
1 - adds removes
1 - removes an
1 - folder helpful
1 - helpful suggestions
1 - suggestions thanks
1 - idea the
1 - side accepting
1 - connection just
1 - to withhold
1 - withhold from
1 - sending anything
1 - valid handshake
1 - handshake any
1 - any portscan
1 - portscan would
1 - dead connection
1 - connection that
1 - doesn't volunteer
1 - identify itself
1 - itself i
1 - have thought
1 - about eventually
1 - eventually ssling
1 - ssling all
1 - the connections
1 - assume anything
1 - ssl would
1 - be pointless
1 - pointless against
1 - against dpi
1 - dpi maybe
1 - better more
1 - more immediate
1 - immediate solution
1 - 2 that's
1 - main things
1 - the agenda
1 - agenda after
1 - 2 yeah
1 - yeah the
1 - other stealth
1 - stealth stuff
1 - stuff would
1 - kinda pointless
1 - pointless if
1 - same port
1 - trying upnp
1 - upnp do
1 - do most
1 - p2p clients
1 - clients typically
1 - typically have
1 - have upnp
1 - upnp enabled
1 - default i'm
1 - how best
1 - to structure
1 - structure the
1 - the management
1 - management interface
1 - interface maybe
1 - maybe command
1 - commands to
1 - background daemon
1 - daemon to
1 - to query
1 - query transactions
1 - transactions received
1 - and initiate
1 - initiate sending
1 - sending transfers
1 - transfers that
1 - more automation
1 - automation friendly
1 - friendly or
1 - http interface
1 - interface on
1 - some port
1 - port other
1 - than 80
1 - 80 to
1 - manage it
1 - browser we've
1 - working hard
1 - hard on
1 - on improvements
1 - version release
1 - release martti

1 - solution of

1 - 00 do
1 - left the

1 - your help
1 - was temporarily

1 - narrowed it
1 - following code
1 - was absolutely
1 - absolutely the

1 - and mainly
1 - mainly only
1 - got tested
1 - tested with
1 - not essential
1 - essential and

1 - hate to

1 - compiler bug
1 - bug before
1 - this feels
1 - like one
1 - some bit
1 - init code
1 - optimize out

1 - dlls they're
1 - they're redistributable
1 - redistributable well
1 - well this
1 - good after
1 - you upgraded
1 - 2 your

1 - responded to
1 - two messages
1 - then stopped
1 - stopped replying
1 - replying to

1 - run then
1 - then if

1 - trace doesn't
1 - doesn't always
1 - always go
1 - go far
1 - enough back
1 - back unfortunately
1 - unfortunately ok
1 - ok so
1 - so no
1 - no crash
1 - or exception
1 - exception window
1 - window or
1 - anything debug
1 - need then
1 - like there's
1 - a select
1 - sockets select
1 - select function
1 - function failed
1 - then network
1 - communication goes
1 - goes quiet
1 - quiet after
1 - that except
1 - for irc
1 - irc which
1 - working i've
1 - had select
1 - select fail
1 - like sockets
1 - is somehow
1 - somehow partially
1 - partially hosed
1 - hosed at
1 - least now
1 - wrong now
1 - should restart
1 - restart it
1 - not doing
1 - anything right
1 - if it'll
1 - failed error
1 - error again
1 - while if
1 - always shut
1 - down and
1 - restart sockets
1 - sockets if
1 - gets hosed
1 - hosed like
1 - sure everyone
1 - everyone who's
1 - who's written
1 - written an
1 - an internet
1 - internet app
1 - app like

1 - can trash
1 - trash you
1 - internet is
1 - a brutal
1 - brutal rough
1 - rough and

1 - the issue
1 - issue of

1 - completely fine
1 - fine and
1 - totally safe
1 - just kill
1 - doesn't exit
1 - exit on
1 - own i'll
1 - on figuring
1 - figuring out
1 - what's getting
1 - getting hung
1 - hung up
1 - just have
1 - kill itself
1 - itself after
1 - timeout i
1 - i've fixed
1 - bug related
1 - to select
1 - error wsaenotsock
1 - wsaenotsock the
1 - select error
1 - error is
1 - deal but
1 - it led
1 - led the

1 - in non-blocking
1 - non-blocking mode
1 - mode but
1 - but wasn't
1 - wasn't it
1 - never came
1 - up until
1 - because as
1 - as select
1 - select never
1 - never failed
1 - failed receive
1 - receive would
1 - be called
1 - called unless
1 - unless there
1 - was data
1 - without this
1 - fix your
1 - node's communication
1 - communication sometimes
1 - sometimes goes
1 - goes dead
1 - dead connections
1 - connections are
1 - still made
1 - no data
1 - passed any
1 - any generated
1 - accepted since
1 - can't broadcast
1 - broadcast them
1 - will leave
1 - leave your
1 - your branch
1 - branch behind
1 - behind that's
1 - why generate
1 - generate doesn't
1 - doesn't run
1 - run when
1 - not connected
1 - connected this
1 - exit there's
1 - for shutdown
1 - shutdown to
1 - the com
1 - only wait
1 - message processing
1 - processing thread
1 - thread i'll
1 - more thorough
1 - thorough forced
1 - forced shutdown
1 - shutdown later
1 - later looks
1 - node's com
1 - thread just
1 - now got
1 - got blocked
1 - bug again
1 - it went
1 - went for
1 - did version
1 - 3 exe
1 - exe attached
1 - it definitely
1 - definitely looks
1 - 3 solved
1 - solved it
1 - getting so
1 - were so
1 - many zombie
1 - zombie nodes
1 - nodes i
1 - was having
1 - a hard
1 - hard time
1 - time getting

1 - back did
1 - any not

1 - the connectivity
1 - connectivity bug
1 - bug could
1 - caused a
1 - node wasn't
1 - wasn't able
1 - broadcast at
1 - time once
1 - status is
1 - above 5
1 - it's safely
1 - safely accepted
1 - accepted unfortunately
1 - am which
1 - made things
1 - things more
1 - difficult your
1 - node receiving
1 - receiving incoming
1 - connections was
1 - thing keeping
1 - going the
1 - first day
1 - two you
1 - my bitcoin
1 - full transfer

1 - ending in
1 - in port
1 - 8333 can
1 - receive connections
1 - just thought
1 - something eventually
1 - eventually there'll
1 - some interest
1 - in brute
1 - force scanning
1 - scanning bitcoin
1 - find one
1 - first few
1 - few characters
1 - characters customized
1 - customized to

1 - a phone
1 - phone number
1 - that spells
1 - spells out
1 - out something
1 - something just
1 - chance i
1 - have my
1 - my initials
1 - initials could
1 - log from
1 - 3 crash
1 - crash i
1 - can usually
1 - usually get
1 - lot just
1 - that i'll
1 - debug builds
1 - builds shortly
1 - shortly here's
1 - 3 msvc
1 - w gdb
1 - exe definitely
1 - full i
1 - i completely
1 - completely put
1 - put off
1 - off disk
1 - full handling
1 - handling until
1 - later version
1 - version probably
1 - probably about
1 - now well
1 - well that's
1 - a relief
1 - relief if
1 - dependencies let
1 - goes everything
1 - always harder
1 - windows than
1 - than linux
1 - linux i've
1 - always hated
1 - hated projects
1 - of big
1 - no avoiding
1 - avoiding it
1 - it each
1 - each one
1 - is essential
1 - essential i
1 - haven't figured
1 - you managed
1 - managed to
1 - a read
1 - read exception
1 - exception rather
1 - a write
1 - write exception
1 - exception when
1 - your disk
1 - disk filled
1 - it's unlikely
1 - unlikely but
1 - maybe possible
1 - the incident
1 - incident could
1 - have messed
1 - messed up
1 - data file
1 - might manifest
1 - manifest as
1 - similar exception
1 - exception again
1 - bar stopped
1 - stopped going
1 - would also
1 - also indicate
1 - indicate a
1 - problem as
1 - this moment
1 - it's at
1 - at 375
1 - 375 blocks
1 - solved by
1 - by deleting
1 - block files
1 - files as
1 - follows it'll
1 - it'll then
1 - then re-download
1 - blocks show
1 - done downloading
1 - hate duplicating
1 - duplicating code
1 - compiler forces
1 - forces us
1 - us copy
1 - function above
1 - the modified
1 - modified version
1 - of serialize
1 - attached btw
1 - tests vc8
1 - vc8 produced
1 - produced an
1 - an exe
1 - on systems
1 - had vc8
1 - vc8 installed

1 - gives is
1 - is extremely
1 - extremely vague
1 - vague i
1 - they expect
1 - install a
1 - package during
1 - during setup
1 - setup but
1 - setup my
1 - testing has
1 - been with
1 - 0 sp6
1 - sp6 and
1 - 5 gcc
1 - build there's
1 - nothing wrong
1 - 0 build

1 - their responses
1 - responses were
1 - were rather

1 - they're so
1 - so used
1 - to being

1 - first what
1 - most right
1 - is website
1 - website writing
1 - my writing
1 - not that
1 - that great
1 - great i'm
1 - better coder
1 - coder maybe
1 - website on

1 - facts and
1 - and details
1 - and ideas
1 - ideas codewise
1 - codewise there's
1 - much that's
1 - easy right
1 - now one
1 - that's needed
1 - an interface
1 - scripting languages
1 - languages such
1 - as java
1 - php asp
1 - asp etc
1 - etc bitcoin
1 - and server
1 - side script
1 - script could
1 - it's windows
1 - guess ole
1 - ole com
1 - com is
1 - interface one
1 - one easy
1 - easy thing
1 - that really
1 - helps is
1 - connections forward
1 - that new
1 - who try
1 - out have
1 - they run
1 - get no
1 - no connections
1 - connections they'll
1 - you dmp1ce
1 - dmp1ce as

1 - and gave
1 - gave you

1 - 25 just
1 - random bad
1 - luck it's
1 - and harmless
1 - harmless to
1 - to randomly
1 - randomly get
1 - some per
1 - per cent
1 - cent of
1 - not-accepted and
1 - and of

1 - unaccepted it's
1 - to default
1 - default to
1 - show giving

1 - values are
1 - are 64-bit
1 - 64-bit integers
1 - integers with

1 - so 1
1 - 1 coin
1 - represented internally
1 - internally as

1 - 100000000 there's

1 - granularity if
1 - if typical
1 - typical prices
1 - prices become
1 - become small
1 - worth 1
1 - 1 euro
1 - euro then
1 - displayed so
1 - 1 bitcoin
1 - it's now
1 - now displayed

1 - 18 months
1 - months development
1 - development it
1 - was something

1 - had imagined
1 - imagined an

1 - far simpler
1 - simpler and
1 - more confidence
1 - confidence inspiring
1 - inspiring to
1 - specific exchange
1 - rate offering
1 - offering currency
1 - back bitcoins
1 - would attract
1 - attract freebie

1 - of attracting
1 - attracting a

1 - publicity at
1 - first it
1 - mostly be
1 - computer's idle
1 - idle time
1 - time maybe
1 - maybe pitched
1 - pitched like
1 - like help
1 - future of
1 - of e-commerce
1 - e-commerce and
1 - little money
1 - computer's spare
1 - spare cycles
1 - cycles as
1 - as people
1 - people cash
1 - and actually
1 - actually get

1 - word would
1 - would spread
1 - spread exponentially
1 - size above
1 - above an

1 - which a
1 - typical user
1 - to accumulate
1 - accumulate with
1 - users have
1 - trade with
1 - other for
1 - collect enough
1 - in aggregators
1 - aggregators would
1 - up shop
1 - shop to
1 - bitcoins in
1 - in smaller
1 - increments which
1 - add confidence
1 - in users
1 - users ability
1 - sell bitcoins
1 - more available
1 - available buyers
1 - buyers than
1 - just you
1 - would obviously
1 - obviously be
1 - be sceptical
1 - sceptical at
1 - first that
1 - the backing
1 - backing will
1 - will hold
1 - hold up
1 - up against
1 - against an
1 - an onslaught
1 - onslaught of
1 - people trying
1 - the competition
1 - competition raises
1 - raises the
1 - difficulty it
1 - should become
1 - become clear
1 - that bitcoins
1 - bitcoins stay
1 - stay scarce
1 - scarce people
1 - will see
1 - would establish
1 - minimum value
1 - value under
1 - under bitcoins
1 - bitcoins enabling
1 - enabling them
1 - purposes if
1 - if hopefully
1 - hopefully other
1 - purposes are
1 - are waiting
1 - powerful if
1 - was also
1 - also some
1 - some narrow
1 - narrow product
1 - product market
1 - virtual currencies
1 - like tencent's
1 - tencent's q
1 - q coin
1 - coin have
1 - made headway
1 - headway with
1 - with virtual
1 - virtual goods
1 - goods it
1 - be sweet
1 - sweet if
1 - to horn
1 - horn in
1 - in on
1 - market like
1 - official virtual
1 - virtual currency
1 - currency gets
1 - gets clamped
1 - clamped down
1 - down on
1 - with limitations
1 - limitations not
1 - not saying
1 - can't work
1 - without something
1 - something but
1 - ready specific
1 - transaction need
1 - it fills
1 - fills would
1 - certainty of
1 - success basically
1 - basically like
1 - ebay site
1 - with user
1 - reviews to
1 - establish which
1 - which sellers
1 - trusted the
1 - feature will
1 - will help
1 - help but
1 - not solve
1 - solve everything
1 - everything it
1 - far more
1 - up such
1 - site than
1 - single exchange
1 - site of
1 - own and
1 - enough users
1 - thinking it
1 - ebay type
1 - type site
1 - site until
1 - later even
1 - had automation
1 - automation you'd
1 - you'd probably
1 - to review
1 - review orders
1 - orders manually
1 - manually before
1 - before processing
1 - processing them
1 - them anyway
1 - process orders
1 - orders by
1 - hand especially
1 - especially at
1 - always set
1 - minimum order
1 - order size
1 - keep orders
1 - orders more
1 - more infrequent
1 - infrequent that's
1 - could probably
1 - probably get
1 - a donor
1 - donor to
1 - send currency
1 - you which
1 - you convert
1 - to euros
1 - euros and
1 - and pay
1 - pay out
1 - through methods
1 - are convenient
1 - users i
1 - exchange business
1 - business myself
1 - myself but
1 - done independently
1 - independently of
1 - of me
1 - more software
1 - software development
1 - development to
1 - also i'd
1 - trying for
1 - a bootstrap
1 - bootstrap application
1 - use bitcoins
1 - for i've
1 - some ideas
1 - ideas that
1 - done before
1 - before an
1 - exchange exists
1 - exists btw
1 - buy bitcoin
1 - bitcoin com
1 - com before
1 - no chance
1 - chance it's
1 - it's owned
1 - a professional
1 - professional domain
1 - domain speculator
1 - speculator it's
1 - normal for
1 - have org
1 - bad glad
1 - worked it's
1 - pain that
1 - so big
1 - build some
1 - them give
1 - give little
1 - little attention
1 - build next
1 - latest versions
1 - versions maybe
1 - maybe i'll
1 - i'll lay
1 - lay everything
1 - everything out
1 - one directory
1 - directory tree
1 - and bundle
1 - bundle the
1 - thing up
1 - up into
1 - a giant
1 - giant archive
1 - archive i'm
1 - they had
1 - had wxpack
1 - wxpack before
1 - before i'm
1 - i'm glad
1 - glad they
1 - they got
1 - so everyone
1 - everyone doesn't
1 - wxwidgets themselves
1 - themselves openssl
1 - openssl is
1 - the harder
1 - harder one
1 - build i
1 - exe size
1 - by running
1 - running strip
1 - strip exe
1 - exe on
1 - debug symbols
1 - symbols that's
1 - mingw that's
1 - better compiler
1 - compiler i
1 - used vc
1 - vc for
1 - for debugging
1 - debugging now
1 - it you've
1 - you've put
1 - your finger
1 - finger on
1 - most important
1 - important missing
1 - missing feature
1 - feature right
1 - magnitude difference
1 - without auto-run
1 - auto-run we'll
1 - we'll almost
1 - never retain
1 - retain nodes
1 - nodes after
1 - after an
1 - initial tryout
1 - tryout interest
1 - interest auto-running
1 - auto-running as
1 - minimized tray
1 - icon by
1 - to success
1 - success for
1 - early file
1 - networks it
1 - been appropriate
1 - 0 when
1 - when stability
1 - stability wasn't
1 - given yet
1 - and stable
1 - stable this
1 - a must-have
1 - must-have feature
1 - any users
1 - that come
1 - we hopefully
1 - hopefully retain
1 - retain this
1 - most user
1 - friendly way
1 - doing auto-run
1 - auto-run is
1 - is putting
1 - putting an
1 - folder i
1 - see openoffice
1 - openoffice org
1 - computer do
1 - way creating
1 - a runas
1 - runas registry
1 - registry entry
1 - entry is
1 - easily visible
1 - visible or
1 - or editable
1 - editable by
1 - users i've
1 - never liked
1 - much i
1 - guess what
1 - want is
1 - an auto-run
1 - auto-run option
1 - option that's
1 - that's on
1 - is changed
1 - changed then
1 - creates or
1 - or deletes
1 - startup icon
1 - icon while
1 - tempting to
1 - port once
1 - extra work
1 - every release
1 - release from
1 - on i'd
1 - rather put
1 - off a
1 - while longer
1 - longer auto-run
1 - auto-run might
1 - us 300
1 - 300 more
1 - nodes while
1 - while linux
1 - linux might
1 - us 3
1 - 3 more
1 - linux would
1 - help server
1 - farms but
1 - actually we'd
1 - we'd like
1 - to favour
1 - favour individual
1 - individual users
1 - users someone
1 - someone reported
1 - reported that
1 - wine that's
1 - great that's
1 - good step
1 - step forward
1 - forward yes
1 - i worked
1 - login problem
1 - some tricky
1 - tricky thing
1 - thing on
1 - that exposed
1 - exposed a
1 - a quirky
1 - quirky bug
1 - browser add-in
1 - add-in thanks
1 - still merging
1 - merging in
1 - had that
1 - in before
1 - before any
1 - any next
1 - things based
1 - on questions
1 - questions and
1 - feedback i've
1 - received that'll
1 - that'll reduce
1 - confusion i'll
1 - probably enable
1 - enable multi-proc
1 - multi-proc generating
1 - generating support
1 - and hopefully
1 - hopefully make
1 - just backup
1 - money it's
1 - be coding
1 - coding again
1 - again i'm
1 - setting which
1 - completely not
1 - serves to
1 - to confuse
1 - confuse people
1 - and demonstration
1 - demonstration of

1 - detail that
1 - needed in
1 - the far
1 - far away
1 - away future
1 - if ever
1 - ever but
1 - but was
1 - implement at
1 - later what
1 - shortcut in

1 - code i'd
1 - another look
1 - look and
1 - first strcat
1 - strcat in
1 - registry code
1 - be strcpy
1 - strcpy otherwise
1 - fail intermittently
1 - intermittently if

1 - shortcut one
1 - it's encouraging
1 - encouraging to
1 - people taking
1 - taking an

1 - so we'll
1 - tell users
1 - users they
1 - can restore
1 - restore just
1 - it'll re-download
1 - rest i'll
1 - another stress
1 - release yeah
1 - yeah i
1 - put back
1 - your startup
1 - folder shortcut
1 - shortcut code
1 - it started
1 - started fine
1 - me too
1 - too on
1 - and vista
1 - vista for
1 - for good
1 - good measure
1 - measure i
1 - shortcut settings
1 - settings look
1 - look identical
1 - identical to
1 - i manually
1 - manually created
1 - created i
1 - i set
1 - the working
1 - working directory
1 - to where
1 - is since
1 - since that's
1 - where debug
1 - created otherwise
1 - otherwise windows
1 - windows puts

1 - didn't change
1 - setup script
1 - script yet
1 - checked everything
1 - setting that

1 - show non-accepted
1 - non-accepted generated
1 - won't show
1 - coins until
1 - confirmation one
1 - block linked
1 - so usually
1 - usually they'll
1 - just never
1 - seen occasionally
1 - occasionally a
1 - was displayed
1 - displayed might
1 - might disappear
1 - disappear because
1 - it became
1 - became not

1 - think anyone

1 - would notice
1 - occasional non-accepteds
1 - non-accepteds if
1 - didn't point
1 - point them
1 - ui people
1 - have told

1 - they find
1 - it annoying
1 - as they're
1 - they're permanently
1 - permanently displayed
1 - transaction record
1 - record i
1 - we gotta
1 - gotta test
1 - test windows
1 - windows 7
1 - 7 now
1 - had any
1 - any reports
1 - reports of
1 - of crashes
1 - crashes in
1 - 5 it's
1 - been rock
1 - rock solid
1 - solid for
1 - me on
1 - be wine
1 - wine related
1 - related if
1 - another crash
1 - crash in
1 - wine and
1 - prints anything
1 - anything on
1 - the terminal
1 - terminal e-mail
1 - me and
1 - happened maybe
1 - maybe something
1 - work around
1 - around martti
1 - martti and
1 - any wine
1 - wine fixes
1 - fixes in
1 - there those
1 - those don't

1 - only workaround
1 - you right

1 - solved liberty's
1 - liberty's zombie
1 - zombie socket
1 - socket problem
1 - root cause
1 - cause it's
1 - to terminate
1 - terminate and
1 - restart the
1 - sockets are
1 - are marked
1 - marked non-blocking
1 - non-blocking already
1 - why maybe
1 - it forgot
1 - forgot i
1 - suppose if
1 - socket fails
1 - fails and
1 - os closes
1 - closes it
1 - nothing left
1 - remember it
1 - was non-blocking
1 - non-blocking but
1 - then accessing
1 - accessing a
1 - a closed
1 - closed handle
1 - handle should
1 - should return
1 - return immediately
1 - immediately with
1 - error there's
1 - no on
1 - windows marking
1 - marking the
1 - socket as
1 - as nonblocking
1 - nonblocking is
1 - way so
1 - anyone runs
1 - runs the
1 - wine it
1 - on terminating
1 - terminating the
1 - only problem
1 - problem now
1 - db exceptions
1 - exceptions he's
1 - getting i
1 - had expected
1 - expected those
1 - those to
1 - a wine
1 - wine problem
1 - problem but
1 - but he's
1 - getting them
1 - linux just
1 - same he
1 - he tried
1 - tried moving
1 - datadir to
1 - different drive
1 - drive no
1 - help i've
1 - never gotten
1 - gotten them
1 - them i'm
1 - i'm running
1 - a stress
1 - that continuously
1 - continuously generates
1 - of activity
1 - activity and
1 - db access
1 - and never
1 - has ubuntu
1 - ubuntu 64-bit
1 - have 32-bit
1 - 32-bit so
1 - i'm assuming
1 - assuming that's
1 - machine 64-bit
1 - or 32-bit
1 - 32-bit have
1 - ever had
1 - a db
1 - exception see
1 - see db
1 - log also
1 - also now
1 - test5 could
1 - machine we
1 - a 3rd
1 - 3rd vote
1 - vote to
1 - we're dealing
1 - with here
1 - here the
1 - is uncaught
1 - uncaught so
1 - stop the

1 - btw zetaboards
1 - zetaboards insists
1 - insists on
1 - on displaying
1 - displaying member
1 - member so
1 - you better
1 - better sign
1 - sign up
1 - up soon
1 - and grab
1 - grab a
1 - good account
1 - number i'd
1 - i'd better
1 - better install
1 - install 64-bit
1 - 64-bit then
1 - i imagine
1 - imagine it's

1 - some cloud-based
1 - cloud-based center
1 - center authorities
1 - authorities in
1 - attack with
1 - an enormous
1 - enormous fake
1 - fake block
1 - block can
1 - be prevented
1 - prevented at
1 - time 1m
1 - 1m is
1 - good number
1 - going and
1 - and therefore
1 - therefore the
1 - the experiment
1 - experiment as
1 - number should
1 - should grow
1 - grow too
1 - too i
1 - number suitable
1 - for mid-term
1 - mid-term perhaps
1 - perhaps is
1 - is around
1 - around 200m
1 - 200m which
1 - is sufficient
1 - sufficient for
1 - transaction rate
1 - rate much
1 - the sum
1 - sum of
1 - any current
1 - current center
1 - authority banks
1 - banks however
1 - however that
1 - cause insane
1 - insane traffic
1 - traffic for
1 - the lightning
1 - lightning thing
1 - also not
1 - perfect solution
1 - solution as
1 - second level
1 - level architect
1 - architect it
1 - more trust
1 - may encourage
1 - encourage center
1 - authority and
1 - and paypal-like
1 - paypal-like companies
1 - companies the
1 - designed so
1 - verify itself
1 - itself people
1 - people only
1 - one hash
1 - entire blockchain
1 - is genuine
1 - genuine so
1 - be removed
1 - removed any
1 - any hard
1 - hard limits
1 - limits prevent
1 - prevent people
1 - as frequently
1 - frequently as
1 - want should
1 - not exist
1 - exist to
1 - the traffic
1 - traffic problem
1 - problem nodes
1 - can exchange

1 - blockchain scalability
1 - scalability and
1 - and speed
1 - speed can
1 - can both
1 - both be
1 - be achieved
1 - achieved this
1 - solution network
1 - network speed
1 - storage space
1 - space should
1 - future so
1 - big block
1 - clients even
1 - mobile clients
1 - clients in
1 - proof-of-work should
1 - be carefully
1 - carefully verified
1 - verified before
1 - receiving process
1 - process to
1 - prevent a
1 - attack against
1 - network moreover
1 - moreover router's
1 - router's ip
1 - ip should
1 - should also
1 - checked to
1 - avoid a

1 - user an
1 - an insane
1 - insane number
1 - of fees
1 - fees may
1 - may apply
1 - apply in
1 - this situation
1 - situation i
1 - believe bitcoin
1 - an experiment
1 - experiment anymore
1 - anymore it
1 - a newborn
1 - newborn currency
1 - currency removing
1 - removing the
1 - limit will
1 - will remove
1 - remove its
1 - its final
1 - final barrier
1 - barrier but
1 - still decades
1 - decades are
1 - needed the
