2 - in case i need to
2 - i don't know how to
2 - in the 0 3 1
2 - take a look at it
2 - the plan is to implement
2 - warning this block was not
2 - this block was not received
2 - block was not received by
2 - was not received by any
2 - not received by any other
2 - received by any other nodes
2 - the generate thread only changes

2 - to set up port forwarding
2 - irc lfnet org instead of

2 - thanks that's a good idea
2 - how long is the initial

1 - of wxwidgets 2 8 which
1 - wxwidgets 2 8 which is

1 - 8 which is a disaster
1 - which is a disaster because
1 - is a disaster because wchar
1 - a disaster because wchar wxstring

1 - doesn't convert to std string
1 - convert to std string we
1 - to std string we use
