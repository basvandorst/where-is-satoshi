2 - there's one
2 - compile time
2 - switch runtime
2 - like must
2 - case someone
2 - one type
2 - really slow
2 - really nice
2 - that's possible
2 - probably time
2 - time implement

2 - transaction fee's
2 - fee's transaction
2 - would look
2 - per 1000
2 - could pay
2 - pay per

2 - they'll probably
2 - bitcoin practical
2 - practical smaller
2 - bandwidth costs
2 - bitcoin catches
2 - catches big
2 - case time

2 - another way
2 - 5 10
2 - dos attacked
2 - minimum transaction
2 - way people
2 - 00 send
2 - 10 00
2 - add automatically
2 - less 0
2 - first try
2 - smaller transactions
2 - might call
2 - getting slashdotted
2 - node connecting
2 - everyone upgrade
2 - displays warning
2 - extremely important
2 - 2 4x
2 - 4x faster
2 - minority fork
2 - times long
2 - 7 days
2 - also would
2 - coins generated
2 - 3 7
2 - rev 112
2 - make absolutely
2 - would something
2 - try version
2 - 1 37
2 - half way
2 - also could
2 - 1 40
2 - get libboost-all-dev
2 - makes hard
2 - btw tried
2 - 1 34
2 - see bitcoin
2 - latch onto
2 - reliable way
2 - one way
2 - credit debit
2 - would kinda
2 - balance 0
2 - enough money
2 - blocks say
2 - think i'll
2 - lot work

2 - linux users
2 - users got
2 - 5 still
2 - 6 svn
2 - svn updated
2 - updated version
2 - linux time
2 - 6 asap
2 - transactions could
2 - accept bitcoin
2 - faster hashing
2 - speedup 2
2 - large scale
2 - design supports
2 - could verify
2 - well enough
2 - much lower
2 - 10 seconds
2 - seconds less
2 - code here's

2 - sentence would
2 - self parsed
2 - leaning towards
2 - file format
2 - using json
2 - using bitcoind
2 - big hurry
2 - people know
2 - probably want
2 - really important
2 - hope get
2 - assume that's
2 - sounds better
2 - extra parameter
2 - http json-rpc
2 - parameter list
2 - list think
2 - use web
2 - local loopback
2 - password json-rpc
2 - avoid using
2 - quite bit
2 - blocks like
2 - time come
2 - svn changes
2 - better idea
2 - tell run
2 - short password
2 - 15 characters
2 - think right
2 - right thing
2 - almost never

2 - nodes process
2 - support network
2 - fee enough
2 - trust site
2 - data without
2 - goods services
2 - confirmations like
2 - addresses received
2 - address receiving
2 - far i've
2 - receive anything
2 - web apps
2 - 2 4
2 - new button
2 - next address
2 - nothing else
2 - multiple addresses
2 - amounts they've
2 - they've received
2 - change address
2 - one get
2 - received anything
2 - scanning users
2 - complete list
2 - can't resold
2 - uses ec-dsa

2 - magnitude bigger
2 - would impractical
2 - takes long
2 - download typically
2 - work lot
2 - priority things
2 - things work
2 - users transactions
2 - download blocks
2 - 100 000
2 - start running
2 - running full
2 - kind like
2 - like usenet
2 - yet implemented
2 - get larger
2 - errors probably
2 - moving towards
2 - build probably
2 - controlled command
2 - another port
2 - number i'm
2 - one incoming
2 - incoming connection
2 - makes sense
2 - must kept
2 - anything sent
2 - 500 bytes
2 - address use
2 - know received
2 - number days
2 - would never
2 - would fail
2 - go could
2 - http response

2 - side scripting
2 - site gets
2 - cover bandwidth
2 - maybe get

2 - treated like
2 - files without
2 - accept payment
2 - cash would
2 - help support
2 - source projects
2 - projects org
2 - i've always
2 - available anyone
2 - set one
2 - could give
2 - like tor
2 - we'll get
2 - temporary solution
2 - enough static
2 - nodes good
2 - still running
2 - preprogram seed
2 - list would
2 - would ok
2 - server software
2 - minuscule amount
2 - bandwidth cost
2 - can't give
2 - give away
2 - away free
2 - avoid limits
2 - like would
2 - threads processes
2 - there's enough
2 - buyers sellers
2 - exchange service
2 - work fine
